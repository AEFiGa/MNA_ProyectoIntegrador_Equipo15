Callum notes that the 37-year-old Beterbiev (18-0 18 KOs) is getting up there in age and will lose to someone at some point possibly against the heavy-handed Yarde (23-2 22 KOs).

Beterbiev has been dropped twice in his pro career Smith says and he feels that this shows that he’s not invincible. However the guys that knocked Beterbiev down Jeff Page Jr and Callum Johnson could not keep him down and he promptly got up and knocked them out.

Smith is the WBC mandatory and he’ll be facing the winner of the Beterbiev vs. Yarde fight so he’s got a vested interest in the fight. Whether Callum gets his shot in 2023 or he must wait until 2024 he’ll eventually get it sooner or later.

Yarde 31 would seem deficient in experience for him to defeat Beterbiev considering he’s still learning the ropes after eight years in the pro ranks. The progress has been slowed mainly due to the weak match-making Yarde’s management has done on his behalf.

“On paper it’s a very big ask but it comes from someone that wants to fight the winner and who is next to fight the winner” said Callum Smith to Eat Sleep Boxing Repeat about Anthony Yarde having his work cut out for him against IBF WBC & WBO light heavyweight champion Artur Beterbiev on January 28th at the AO Arena in London England.

When Callum gets his chance to potentially fight Beterbiev he may prove to be just as overmatched against him as Yarde. The 6’3″ stork-like Smith has arguably fought just two quality fighters in his career in John Ryder & Canelo Alvarez and he clearly lost to both.

Smith was given a controversial 12 round decision over Ryder in 2019 in his hometown of Liverpool but most boxing fans had him losing that fight.

“Beterbiev on paper he’s an animal and he’s knocked everyone out. He’s not invincible. He’s been put over twice as a professional” Callum said about Beterbiev being dropped two times in his career. “He’s 38 now; he’s not going to go on forever. Someone will beat him at some point. It could be Yarde next weekend. Yarde has heavy hands himself.

“You’ve got to give him a chance in that fight. As of until now Beterbiev has yet to show signs of age and he looked good last time out against Joe Smith.

“So with saying that you’ve got to put him as the favorite but I don’t believe it’s a foregone conclusion as some people make out. But he definitely is the favorite for me.

“No but I’m the mandatory with the WBC” said Callum when asked if he’s had any contact about him facing the winner. “At the WBC convention they said the [Beterbiev vs. Yarde] winner has to fight me.

“If you want to do any sort of unification it has to go through me first but I think the WBC has banned Russians from fighting for belts anyways which rules the Bivol fight out anyway. So the winner of that fight [Beterbiev-Yarde] has to fight me.

“So I’m in a good position. I’m hoping to fight in the meantime to stay active and make sure the best version of me turns up when I fight the winner. That’s a fight that I believe I can win. I believe I can beat anyone in the world.

“I believe I’m the best fighter in the queue and I believe the best time to do that is now” said Smith.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvcmljaGFyZC1yaWFrcG9yaGUtZXZhbmRlci1ob2x5ZmllbGQtbmV3cy0yODk3NTI4NdIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvcmljaGFyZC1yaWFrcG9yaGUtZXZhbmRlci1ob2x5ZmllbGQtbmV3cy0yODk3NTI4NS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Riakporhe explains Evander Holyfield influence on weight switch plan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.mirror.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sport/boxing/richard-riakporhe-evander-holyfield-news-28975285 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000022784BFFE50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvcmljaGFyZC1yaWFrcG9yaGUtZXZhbmRlci1ob2x5ZmllbGQtbmV3cy0yODk3NTI4NdIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvcmljaGFyZC1yaWFrcG9yaGUtZXZhbmRlci1ob2x5ZmllbGQtbmV3cy0yODk3NTI4NS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvZXViYW5rLWpyLWxpYW0tc21pdGgtdGlja2V0cy0yNTk5NzMxNdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvZXViYW5rLWpyLWxpYW0tc21pdGgtdGlja2V0cy0yNTk5NzMxNS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to buy tickets for Chris Eubank Jr vs Liam Smith fight at the AO Arena,"Liam Smith makes the trip from Liverpool to Manchester this weekend with a fight against Chris Eubank Jr on Saturday night at the AO Arena.

Meet Navitor the company’s latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system.

Navitor’s recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration not only bolsters Abbott’s structural heart portfolio — which is the most comprehensive in the U.S.1 — but also solidifies the company’s competitiveness in the TAVI market the largest structural heart market about $3 billion U.S. in 2022 and growing.2

And there’s more.

Navitor — which is designed to help open a narrowed aortic valve in people with severe aortic stenosis one of the most common and life-threatening heart valve diseases — gives physicians another minimally-invasive treatment option for people who are at a high or extreme risk for complications from open-heart surgery.

This next-gen technology follows Abbott’s 2021 entry into the U.S. TAVI market with the Portico with FlexNav TAVI system and builds on the company’s industry-leading portfolio of minimally invasive devices.

Navitor received CE Mark in 2021 for people in Europe with severe aortic stenosis at high or extreme surgical risk.

Adding to the momentum are recent data on one-year outcomes showing the safety and effectiveness of Navitor for people with severe aortic stenosis.

“The FDA’s approval of Navitor is a major next step in our mission to help people live better lives through better health” said Michael Dale senior vice president of Abbott's structural heart business. “The Navitor system will continue to enhance minimally invasive treatment options for people with structural heart disease and offer hope to patients who may not have other treatment choices.”

Navitor’s Competitive Advantage

Abbott’s Navitor system stands out from the competition with its unique fabric cuff that reduces or eliminates the backflow of blood around the valve frame a common complication following TAVI procedures.

Navitor is the only self-expanding TAVI system with leaflets within the native valve a design that can make it easier for physicians to access a person’s coronary arteries for future procedures to treat coronary artery disease. The system’s design also provides excellent blood flow through the aortic valve which is important for cardiovascular health.

Learn more about the Navitor system and get insight on other key health technologies in the company’s new product pipeline.

AbbVie and Eli Lilly have exited the U.K.’s Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing and Access a government-industry accord that traces its roots to NHS’ formation according to local trade group The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI).

The move which was prompted by a recent spike in government repayment rates should send a “warning signal” to the U.K. that pharma companies may be unwilling to shoulder “increasingly punitive revenue clawbacks” ABPI said in a release.

The exodus shouldn’t come as a total shock. Back in December ABPI and a host of major drugmakers clapped back after the British government revealed that manufacturers of branded medicines would have to return almost 3.3 billion pounds sterling in revenue—or 26.5% of sales—to the government in 2023. The repayment rate stood at roughly 0.6 billion pounds in 2021 and 1.8 billion pounds in 2022 ABPI said late last year.

“This unsustainable high levy on our revenue means that companies like AbbVie are having to make incredibly difficult decisions on our investment in the UK in terms of R&D highly skilled workforce and our partnerships with the NHS” Todd Manning AbbVie’s general manager in the U.K. said in a statement at the time.

ABPI blames the jump in 2023 repayment rates on “failings in the existing scheme’s design."" The group argues the pricing accord puts the U.K. “completely out of step with its global competitors and outside historical norms.”

Should the U.K. fail to address those “rapidly escalating” repayment rates in the coming years the industry has warned that the U.K. could hamstring its own life sciences goals and send companies and investors packing.

This isn’t the first time AbbVie has decided to shake up a longstanding arrangement in recent months. Across the pond in the U.S. AbbVie late last year said it would leave the trade organizations the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) plus the Business Roundtable.

The exact rationale behind the big pharma’s departure wasn’t immediately clear.

“We regularly evaluate our memberships with industry trade associations and our most recent assessment led us to decide not to renew our membership with select trade associations” an AbbVie spokesperson told Fierce Pharma over email at the time.

Meanwhile outside the U.K. new pricing regulations will soon become a thorn in the side of drugmakers in the U.S. Stateside trade groups and drugmakers alike have largely rallied against the passage of Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act this past summer which will empower Medicare to haggle over certain drug costs among other provisions.

AbbVie's CEO Richard Gonzalez has been a vocal critic of the legislation arguing that the planned price negotiations are more akin to ""price controls.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlbmVuZ25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWJidmllLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtbXJuYS1tb2R1bGF0b3JzLXVzaW5nLWFuaW1hLWJpb3RlY2gtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AbbVie to Develop mRNA Modulators Using Anima Biotech Platform,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlbmVuZ25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWJidmllLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtbXJuYS1tb2R1bGF0b3JzLXVzaW5nLWFuaW1hLWJpb3RlY2gtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000022783FD56F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Companies that realize this opportunity stand to gain a top-line productivity premium of 11%

Moreover the report “The CHRO as a growth executive” underscores the power of the human element. It shows that the 11% productivity premium drops to 4% when companies implement data and tech solutions that fail to put their people at the center highlighting the significant impact that people have as a key source of competitive differentiation and growth.



The top growth drivers identified by CEOs surveyed include enhancing performance and productivity through data tech and AI (38%); accessing and creating top talent (38%); driving collaboration across business units (35%); and enhancing the company’s digital core (34%).



The report identifies the CHRO as a key catalyst in unlocking the value of this data-tech-people combination for growth with talent at the core of reinvention. Among CEOs surveyed 89% say CHROs should play a key role in ensuring long-term profitable growth. However less than half (45%) of CEOs report that they are creating the conditions that enable CHROs to do so.



“CEOs who empower their CHROs as growth executives create the conditions for them to think and act beyond their title” said Ellyn Shook chief leadership and human resources officer Accenture. “When they recognize that people are central to their business these CEOs cultivate the connections skills and environment for CHROs to lead across the C-suite to drive business growth and exceptional human experiences.”



According to the research CHROs who have strong skill sets and connections and operate in the right environment are nearly two times more likely to effectively connect data technology and people than their peers and four times more likely to have strong relationships of mutual influence across the entire C-suite starting with the CEO and in partnership with the CFO CTO and COO.



“As leaders look to digitize faster and put more resilience in their business operations talent and the role of the CHRO have never been more strategic” said Yusuf Tayob group chief executive of Accenture Operations. “The research underscores the tremendous benefit of close collaboration across the C-suite particularly as it relates to their people as companies adapt to new ways of working.”



The research provides a roadmap for how leading CHROs can work differently to accelerate change and outlines the conditions CEOs must create to join the 5% of companies that maximize the growth combination of data technology and people.



About the research

Accenture Research conducted a global survey of 1140 CEOs and CHROs across 12 countries: Australia Brazil Canada China France Germany India Japan Singapore Switzerland the United Kingdom and the United States. Respondents came from 12 industries: Banking Comms & Media Consumer Goods & Services Energy Healthcare High Tech Insurance Life Sciences Public Sector Retail Software & Platforms and Utilities. Findings from the survey were further validated through 17 CEO and CHRO interviews from large organizations around the globe and across multiple industries.

Earlier this month the Krita Foundation (a group building open-source graphics software) posted a screenshot of Adobe’s terms of service to Twitter which reads “Adobe may analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g. for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services.” Some users interpreted this as Adobe using content created by its customers to train generative AI models and criticized the company for opting users into the content analysis by default.

The use of generative AI models like OpenAI’s DALL-E and Midjourney has sparked controversy in the creative community as the tech is often trained using datasets that contain images scraped from the internet without their creators’ permission. Many artists claim that generative art enables AI art prompters to capitalize on the work of human artists without adequate compensation.

Belsky referred to the criticisms as a “wake-up call” and said that the policy isn’t intended for image generation instead allowing products to be analyzed in order to improve their features.

“We are rolling out a new evolution of this policy that is more specific” Belsky said. “If we ever allow people to opt-in for generative AI specifically we need to call it out and explain how we’re using it” later adding “We have to be very explicit about these things.”

Adobe has developed several products and tools that utilize AI algorithms such as Adobe Sensei. Adobe Sensei is an intelligence layer that integrates with software like Photoshop Lightroom and Premiere Pro and can be used by creators to automate mundane or repetitive tasks — such as identifying elements within images like faces or buildings and suggesting tags for images within the Creative Cloud.

Some Adobe applications like Lightroom include AI features that automate tedious parts of image editing such as masking and object selection. Image: Adobe

While other companies and content platforms have moved to restrict or outright ban AI-generated content Adobe has taken a more flexible approach. In addition to working on its own AI tools the company is also working on features to help highlight when images are altered or generated; a beta feature for Photoshop called Content Credentials was released during its Adobe Max 2022 conference which allows creators to embed attribution metadata to an exported image.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9hZG9iZS1hY3JvYmF0LWRj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Acrobat DC review,"May not be the best for beginners with its overwhelming interface and feature set

Adobe Acrobat DC has a long history on the market for PDF editors. The tool has had its ups and downs but it’s ultimately managed to retain a position as one of the best PDF editors out there. It brings a lot of features to the table and even though this might be a bit too much for some beginners it’s still great for those who know how to take advantage of what Acrobat DC has to offer. If you’re looking for a simple straightforward PDF editor for small operations this is probably not the ideal choice for your needs. However if you’re a serious user who needs lots of advanced features Acrobat DC is one of the top choices right now.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Adobe Acrobat isn’t just one of the best PDF editors on the market. It was also the original created by Adobe three decades ago to standardize documents so they appear the same no matter what device or operating system it’s opened on (you can discover the full history in 30 years of PDF: The file format that changed the world ).

But while a lot - seemingly everything - has changed since 1993 the humble Portable Document Format remains a mainstay for offices keen to keep everyone on the same (formatted) page. Since launching the first PDF editing software we've seen the rise of the best free PDF editors and some paid-for alternatives that have created serious competition for Adobe.

Can the premiere PDF editor retain its place at the top?

Adobe Acrobat Pro DC subscription options: 1 month plan - $14.99 per month ($14.99 total cost)

Adobe Acrobat DC vs Acrobat Pro DC vs Adobe Reader DC: what’s the difference?

Adobe offers three PDF readers for Windows Mac and mobile: Acrobat Reader DC Acrobat DC (known as Acrobat Standard DC) and Acrobat Pro DC.

Acrobat Reader DC is a free PDF reader that you view annotate and print files. Beyond this the free PDF software is functional and limited. There’s no option to edit or convert files or do much else beyond reading and searching documents.

Acrobat DC is a full Windows-only PDF editor and reader that requires a Creative Cloud subscription. But you gain the ability to read comment scan sign and convert PDFs to Word  Excel and other popular formats.

Acrobat Pro DC builds on the features of Adobe’s Acrobat Standard DC. Available on both Windows and Mac it features all the functionality of Acrobat DC but for a moderate price increase also lets you edit and search scanned files insert multimedia into documents and perform side-by-side comparisons between two PDFs.

Plans and pricing

The tool is offered with various pricing plans that should fit most people’s needs. You can subscribe to the Pro or Standard version with the former costing around $2-3 more per month depending on your subscription type and you can subscribe for a full year (paid in one installment or monthly) or on a monthly basis. There are special plans aimed at businesses as well as students and teachers.

The Pro version adds a few new features that are exclusive to it such as document comparison (with the ability to strip out differences) OCR redaction and validation. Most of these features are aimed at business users with very specific needs so most users will probably do fine without them. On the other hand the added cost of the Pro subscription makes it a good offer for those who need its advanced features.

Features

Adobe Acrobat DC comes with various features to help you organize your PDFs and get the most out of them. You have standard editing features including the ability to split and merge documents edit their style cut/insert text and more. You can also convert to and from various formats including Word and different image formats. The program also provides the possibility to compress PDFs without any loss of information though the success rate of that operation will depend on a large number of factors specific to your documents.

Acrobat DC supports standard form editing functionality as well though it can come off as a bit limited in this regard if you’re used to other tools. The form editor should be enough for most people’s needs still but keep in mind that there are better alternatives available if that’s going to be a major part of your daily work.

Interface and in use

Acrobat DC comes with a polished responsive interface that leaves nothing to be desired and is one of the strong points of the application. Adobe’s software suite has generally been known for this and the company has a strong reputation for their advanced approach to UI. The only downside in this regard is that Acrobat DC is a bit heavier than the typical PDF editor and requires a beefy computer to work correctly.

Adobe has a number of helpful tutorials on its site to help you get started with Acrobat DC (Image credit: Adobe)

Support

Adobe is known for their great customer support and you’re going to find a lot of information already available at the knowledge base to begin with. Most of your questions should be answered there especially those concerning general application use. If you need advanced support you can expect the team to get back to you relatively fast and they are known for the high quality of their support specialists so you can expect a quick resolution to your problems.

The competition

Acrobat DC is sort of in its own rank on the current market for PDF editors and has no real competition. The program is the most professional PDF editor out at the moment and it comes with lots of advanced features fit for everyone’s needs. The only exception is if you need something more advanced for filling out forms in which case an editor like PDF24 Creator or PDFZilla could work better despite looking a bit clunkier.

Final verdict

Adobe Acrobat DC is not the cheapest option on the market for PDF editors but it deserves its solid reputation. The application has pretty much everything you might need to work on PDF documents and take your work with them to the next level and it’s all presented in a nice comprehensive interface. Give the free trial a go and see if it fits your requirements as it’s very likely that you won’t need to search further after checking out what Acrobat DC has to offer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhbnBvbnRlZnJhY3QvMjAyMy8wMS8xOC9hZG9iZS12aWNlLXByZXNpZGVudC1oYXMtdXNlZC1hLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtbW9zYWljLWZvci15ZWFyc21heWJlLXlvdS1zaG91bGQtdG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Vice President Has Used A Leadership Mosaic For Years - Maybe You Should Too,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2023/01/18/adobe-vice-president-has-used-a-leadership-mosaic-for-yearsmaybe-you-should-too/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhbnBvbnRlZnJhY3QvMjAyMy8wMS8xOC9hZG9iZS12aWNlLXByZXNpZGVudC1oYXMtdXNlZC1hLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtbW9zYWljLWZvci15ZWFyc21heWJlLXlvdS1zaG91bGQtdG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZnN0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9waG90b3Nob3AvaG93LWNoYW5nZS1oYWlyLWNvbG9yLWVhc2lseS1hbmQtcXVpY2tseS1saWdodHJvb20tNjI0MzQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Change Hair Color Easily and Quickly in Lightroom,"You would be surprised how many times you might want to change the color of something in post-production. This video shows you how to do it quickly and easily in Adobe Lightroom.

Before I started I couldn't have imagined how many times I would need to change the color of things in my commercial photography. I thought that I would just get the right model props clothes and so on and that would be that. This was naive. In actuality I have often had to shoot without every color in the frame perfect and then change it in post.

If you'd asked me ten years ago I would have doubled down my position on not needing to change colors when it comes to hair. Then I had a brief land in my inbox which wanted a specific type of portrait and I had an image already shot that would be a great fit. There were two issues however: firstly they wanted it in the snow and I shot it in high summer. This was easily fixed as the image had a shallow depth of field so I just made some color tweaks and then added some blurry snowflakes. Secondly they wanted a redhead and my model was blonde. Again I fixed it with some color editing and the image was suddenly exactly what they were after.

You don't often need to edit hair colors at least in my experience but the tools to do it are worth having!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vYnJhbmQtbWFya2V0aW5nL2Fkb2JlLWNtby1hbm4tbGV3bmVzLXRvLXJldGlyZS1hZnRlci0xNi15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe CMO Ann Lewnes to Retire After 16 Years,Few CMOs remain at a single organization for very long.

The move comes barely two years after the Odisha government had decided to buyback its 49% share in OPGC from AES Corporation Ltd an US-based company.

The company which had acquired 49% share in OPGC in 1998 had decided to sell its share in August 2020 for $135 million (around Rs 1000 crore at that time). Now the state government owns 100% stake in the thermal power plant.

The Odisha energy department has invited global expression of interest (EOI) for the proposed disinvestment in the PSU though it has not cited any reason behind the move. The amount it will gain following the disinvestment process has also not been clarified by the department.

When contacted Odisha energy secretary Nikunja Bihari Dhal did not respond to repeated calls from The Indian Express.

“Any government or private entity having sound technical and financial strength can participate to acquire share in OPGC” said a senior government official requesting anonymity.

The disinvestment will be completed in a two-stage process; the SBI Capital Markets Limited (SBICAP) has been roped in as transaction adviser for the process.

Established in November 1984 OPGC operates state-of-the-art coal-fired power plant with total four units. While two units of 210 MW each were operational since the last 25 years two more units of 660 MW each were added in the second phase in 2019. The first two units have coal linkage from the nearby mines of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd and the remaining two units are sourcing coal from Manoharpur through a subsidiary of OPGC.

According to sources in the state energy department OPGC is contemplating expansion of its present capacity through implementation of Phase III by installing two more units having a capacity of 660 MW each.

“The expansion will provide an additional 198000 square feet of space at the Frederick site” a spokesperson with Agilent Technologies Inc. told Commercial Property Executive. News of plans for an addition at the Frederick campus at Eagle Business Park comes on the heels of Agilent’s site selection process which involved a national search that commenced in the first quarter of 2022. The project will entail the addition of two new manufacturing lines that will allow the company to help meet the growing demand for therapeutic nucleic acids.

The construction undertaking will yield a manufacturing and office facility in the form of two buildings linked by a breezeway as well as outdoor ancillary structures and additional parking accommodations. Agilent brought engineering and construction firm Fluor Corp. aboard to serve as consulting architect/engineer for the facility which will incorporate state-of-the-art automation and engineering features including recycling and water reduction and solvent capturing. Turner Construction is serving as the general contractor for the expansion endeavor.

Mutual commitment

It was in 2006 when Agilent first established a presence in Colorado with the opening of a manufacturing facility in the Boulder area. Ten years later in 2016 the company settled on Frederick for the location of a new production center following a national site selection search. That project reached completion in 2019 with Agilent having invested $185 million to bring the 135000-square-foot campus to fruition. In 2020 Agilent revealed that it would enhance the size of the Frederick facility with a 25000-square-foot addition marking a $150 million investment.

Agilent moves forward with its latest Frederick expansion with widespread support in the form of incentives from local agencies the state of Colorado and Weld County. In December 2022 the Board of County Commissioners of Weld County agreed by unanimous vote to provide Agilent with approximately $6.2 million in tax incentives over a 10-year period.

Agilent will reportedly break ground on the Frederick expansion later in January of this year. If all goes as planned the project will reach completion in 2026.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xODU3NjA4NzY4L3BoYXJtYWNldXRpY2FsLWZpcm0tY29tbWl0cy10by03MjUtbWlsbGlvbi1leHBhbnNpb24tb2YtZGVudmVyLWFyZWEtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1odWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharmaceutical Firm Commits to $725 Million Expansion of Denver-Area Manufacturing Hub,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.costar.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/1857608768/pharmaceutical-firm-commits-to-725-million-expansion-of-denver-area-manufacturing-hub (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000227856D07F0>, 'Connection to www.costar.com timed out.

The exception was Australia where a transition to warmer summer weather and increased renewables output pushed feedstock prices down for electrolytic hydrogen.

Victoria alkaline electrolysis averaged $1.74/kg in December down 43% month on month with costs below $1/kg on some days rivaling some of the cheapest CO2-unabated steam methane reforming production pathways in the US.

Hydrogen production via steam methane reforming without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) for US Gulf Coast was the cheapest globally for December 2022 at $1.27/kg.

However the US west coast witnessed freezing temperatures on a deep cold spell leading to a rise in gas and power demand. Southern California alkaline electrolysis more than doubled over November averaging $13.79/kg in December.

In Europe cold weather and low wind generation boosted input power and gas costs tempered by robust gas storage levels. UK PEM electrolysis remained the most expensive production pathway globally averaging $32.41/kg up over 30% on the month.

For the fourth quarter production costs slipped overall for most locations coming off third-quarter peaks in feedstock costs as Europe struggled with soaring power and gas prices and a cold winter in Australia led to a surge in prices.

Market price indications

Market-based pricing indications started to emerge with project developers who can source power directly or secure long-term power purchase agreements tapping into costs well below grid-based market indications.

At the start of January Portugal announced a tender for 120 GWh/year of renewable hydrogen with a first auction to take place in the second half of 2023.

Price ceilings in the auctions have been set at Eur127.00/MWh ($135/MWh) for hydrogen which converts to Eur3.81/kg.

Producers will compete to sell output to a central buyer on 10-year contracts. That will be the last resort gas shipper in Portugal Galp.

Meanwhile Octopus Hydrogen is marketing its supplies in the UK at prices starting from GBP5.30/kg ($6.5/kg) delivered.

And in December Germany launched the first green ammonia tender under its H2Global import scheme with a first deadline for expressions of interest at the start of February. The tender results should give an early indication of market value for green hydrogen carriers such as ammonia delivered to Europe.

US boost

Policy wrangling in the EU continues to hold up investment decisions for projects in Europe and the race is on between large-scale project developers elsewhere to produce the lowest cost green hydrogen with the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) giving a boost to investment there.

Indeed HSBC said in a research note Jan. 16 that the tax credit incentives of the IRA gave the US an advantage over other potential large-scale production centers such as the Middle East.

Air Products and AES are developing a green hydrogen project in Texas backed by 1.4 GW of wind and solar power generation to produce over 200 mt/day of hydrogen targeting commercial operations from 2027.

HSBC estimated the Air Products/AES project would need a lower hydrogen price to meet a 10% return on capital than the 650 mt/d Neom project in Saudi Arabia powered by 4 GW of renewables -- in which Air Products is also a partner -- despite higher capital costs because of a combined incentive of around $5/kg from hydrogen tax credits and renewable energy generation credits in the US.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiygFodHRwczovL3RveGljZnJlZWZ1dHVyZS5vcmcvcHJlc3Mtcm9vbS9iYW5zLW9uLWRhbmdlcm91cy1jaGVtaWNhbHMtaW4tcGxhc3RpY3MtdGhhdC1hcmUtcHV0LWluLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLXZpbnlsLWZsb29yaW5nLWFuZC1iZXZlcmFnZS1saW5lcnMtYW1vbmctZmlyc3QtaW4tbmF0aW9uLXBvbGljaWVzLXByb3Bvc2VkLWluLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tc3RhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bans on dangerous chemicals in plastics that are put in electronics vinyl flooring and beverage liners among first-in ...,"Public hearing held today on proposed new rules as part of Safer Products for Washington law

Health advocates scientists community members and firefighters testify that bans are urgently needed to protect health water and wildlife

Olympia WA—Today Washington State Department of Ecology held a public hearing on proposed new rules that would ban dangerous chemicals in plastics and other materials—including PFAS phthalates flame retardants and bisphenols—that are put in electronics vinyl flooring and beverage packaging among other products. If enacted Washington would become the first state in the nation to have these policies. The rules are being proposed under the Safer Products for Washington law which was passed in 2019 to protect vulnerable populations and species such as pregnant women babies workers highly impacted communities salmon and orcas.

A detailed chart of the proposed restrictions and reporting can be found here.

Health advocates scientists community members and firefighters testified at today’s public hearing urging swift adoption of the rules.

The following statements were made:

Cheri Peele senior project manager for Toxic-Free Future:

“Strong regulatory actions are needed to protect vulnerable populations and vulnerable species from pregnant women and children to salmon and orcas. Protecting the most vulnerable including highly impacted communities is core to the Safer Products for Washington Law—and the only solution is prevention. Especially for persistent chemicals limits need to be as close to zero as possible. All organohalogens need to be banned to achieve a circular economy. Products with hazardous organohalogens can’t be recycled because they wind up in other products from toys to kitchen utensils.”

AJ Johnson legislative liaison Washington State Council of Fire Fighters (WSCFF):

“The use of organohalogens in flame retardants threatens the health of firefighters. Cancer is now the leading cause of death among firefighters. And we have much higher rates of cancer than the general population. Substituting safer alternatives or organohalogen flame retardants is pure common sense and reduces unnecessary exposure to chemicals that can cause a range of health effects including cancer.”

Dr. Mark Rossi executive director Clean Production Action:

“Treating organohalogens as a class is a widespread practice in the electronics industry. There are clearly safer alternatives to these flame retardants in these applications that meet fire safety standards.”

Brandi Hyatt Yakima WA:

“My husband two small children and I have been unknowingly exposed to high levels of PFAS chemicals through our drinking water. I have a disease that exposure to forever chemicals is linked to. If I had been given a choice if the knowledge had been shared if people that knew about PFAS chemicals before me had informed me I would have NEVER knowingly exposed the health and safety of myself and family. We the people have a right to say NO to forever chemicals. Every exposure pathway should be eliminated whether it be water cookware food packaging textiles firefighting foam…Please protect our Earth and bodies. Moving forward with this rule will create positive change. Pursue PFAS free.”

Dr. Gillian Miller senior scientist Ecology Center:

“BPA is a well-studied reproductive toxicant associated with fertility effects and low birth weights… For these reasons BPA is banned from receipt paper in the European Union and BPS and other bisphenols are targeted for regulatory action. Better options are readily available. Companies can avoid automatically printing receipts and offer an electronic receipt option. For receipts that do get printed several non-bisphenol drop-in replacements are available.”

Dr. Courtney Carignan assistant professor Michigan State University:

“I cannot overstate what a serious problem widespread use of halogenated flame retardants and PFAS have created. Among the most highly exposed include infants young children workers including fire fighters and construction workers and indigenous populations. We are all initially exposed in the womb then via breast milk and in our homes through our products. We are all secondarily exposed through their ubiquitous presence in our outdoor environment where they migrate and accumulate in our foods – crops livestock fish and seafood. PFAS additionally travel with the water cycle into our drinking water aquaculture and agriculture. Widespread exposure and health effects of phthalates phenols halogenated flame retardants and PFAS are well documented and it’s time to take decisive action. I support the proposed rule and recommend its full adoption.”

BACKGROUND ON SAFER PRODUCTS FOR WASHINGTON

Washington State passed precedent-setting legislation the Safer Products for Washington Act in 2019. The law directs Washington state agencies to identify the products that are significant sources of high-priority chemicals and provides authority to take action to reduce them. Washington’s Department of Ecology can ban or require disclosure of harmful chemicals in a wide range of products—from plastics and personal care products to electronics and building materials. It can also require companies to provide full ingredient information in products in order to make regulatory determinations under the law.

A growing body of science and Toxic-Free Future’s own research have documented that chemicals escape out of products into dust and air in our homes travel through wastewater and pollute homes waters the food supply and even us. A 2019 scientific study led by Toxic-Free Future found organohalogen flame retardants in 100% of TVs tested which were purchased from Best Buy and Amazon. In 2022 TFF released a study that found PFAS in most products labeled stain- and water-resistant with 72% testing positive for PFAS. A 2021 peer-reviewed study led by scientists at Toxic-Free Future (TFF) the University of Washington and Indiana University found PFAS in 100% of breast milk samples tested and that detections of PFAS currently used in products are doubling every four years.

Costs of cleanup and health impacts due to these chemicals such as the toxic “forever chemicals” PFAS are significant for governments taxpayers and businesses.

The findings of safer alternatives as required by the Washington state law uses hazard-based tools such as GreenScreen and ChemFORWARD which are also helping manufacturers and retailers transition to safer chemicals and materials.

Retailers and brands are increasingly adopting safer chemicals policies to eliminate hazardous chemicals such as PFAS in key product sectors according to the annual Retailer Report Card. Many leading retailers have already adopted voluntary commitments to reduce and eliminate the very same chemicals that Ecology is proposing to restrict in the same product categories. Last year Best Buy announced display enclosures and stands of all newly designed models of Best Buy’s Exclusive Brand televisions will no longer contain toxic organohalogen flame retardants (OFRs). Other leading consumer electronic brands such as Samsung LG Electronics and SONY have also taken action to reduce the use of OFRs in the enclosures of televisions they sell.

The top five other importers were the EU India Turkey and South Korea.

Oil product imports to the EU will be banned in Feb and Germany previously the largest pipeline oil importer stopped imports at the end of the year.

China imported a mix of crude oil coal pipeline gas and oil products. The EU imported pipeline gas oil products and crude oil via pipeline or rail. India’s imports were mostly crude oil. Turkey imported a mix of coal oil products pipeline gas and crude oil. South Korea’s imports consisted of coal crude oil and oil products.

Four of the the top five ports importing Russian fossil fuels were in Asia with crude oil dominating as the imported commodity. One of the top five ports was in Europe importing oil products.

The top five EU importer countries last week were Germany Austria Slovakia Belgium and the Netherlands.

Crude oil shipments from Russia rose in the past week with imports to Egypt and to unknown destinations on the rise. Shipments of oil products stayed rather stable.

The share of tankers covered by the price cap in crude oil shipments out of Russia has stayed at around 60% while the share of “others” is around 40%. For oil products and chemicals the coverage of the price cap coalition remains high at above 70%. These high shares illustrate the leverage the price cap coalition has to ratchet down the price cap.

There is a small decline in oil‑on‑water for crude oil. Oil products on water have not seen significant changes.

The glut of LNG cargoes continues with a collapse of EU LNG imports.

Urals crude prices remained below USD 50 per barrel well below the price cap level of USD 60. However the East Siberia–Pacific Ocean (ESPO) price mainly applying to Chinese purchases has remained above the price cap at USD 68–73.

But let’s be honest we’re all guilty of making – and breaking – our January promises.

For those determined to earn more this year and stick with it becoming a Host on Airbnb might be the answer. New insights from Airbnb show that nearly 40 percent of US Hosts that became active last January went on to become Superhosts1.

We may only be a few weeks into the New Year but many soon-to-be Hosts are wasting no time listing homes in 2023.

Our 2023 Hosts are joining the ongoing travel resurgence bringing economic opportunities for communities and extra income for Hosts. In fact new Hosts in 2022 earned over $1.5 billion in income between January and September 2022 in the US alone.

What’s more is that new homes on Airbnb are getting booked almost immediately with half of listings activated and booked in Q3 2022 receiving their first reservation within three days.

Meet some of our first Hosts of 2023

Now is the perfect time to Host and these go-getters were off to the races as some of Airbnb’s first Hosts of 2023 in the US and Canada signing up within minutes on the first day of the year.

Joanne & John (Dover NH United States) “We stumbled across our dream home a few years in advance of being able to live there full-time. We bought it anyway knowing that as Hosts we could bridge the gap between the present and our future plans to live in this incredible home.”

Elliott (Kailua-Kona HI United States) “Getting a space with room for an Airbnb would make it possible for us to live in our dream home and cover costs with the extra income. We’re so excited to be Hosts to travelers from all around the world!”

Megan (British Columbia Canada)

“We wanted to have an opportunity to share our space with visitors to the Cowichan Valley. There are limited options available in the area for accommodations and we live in a busy tourist area surrounded by wineries. We can’t wait to take on a new opportunity to make the best use of our home and help travelers explore what our community has to offer.”

It’s never been easier to host

Whether the goal is to travel more offset holiday season costs or combat the rising cost of living hosting on Airbnb has never been easier.

With the introduction of Airbnb Setup the all-new super easy way to Airbnb a home new Hosts can access one-to-one guidance from a Superhost; the opportunity to have an experienced guest for your first booking; and specialized support from Airbnb Community Support agents in over 42 languages.

Hosts also get even more AirCover now featuring even more top-to-bottom protection including guest identity verification reservation screening and $3M damage protection including coverage for cars boats art and valuables. And with new private rooms listings added to the platform up 31 percent between Q3 2021 and Q3 2022 upgrades to AirCover gives more protection whether Hosts are inside or outside their home.

I call it “qualitative research”. Having engaged in a lot of qualitative research recently I’ve discovered the following: everyone is sick of Airbnb. In its early years Airbnb was a more economical and adventurous alternative to a hotel. Nowadays it costs a small fortune to rent a shack on Airbnb and when you get there you are forced to abide by a long list of rules and buy your own toilet paper. It’s become a bit like staying with your cheapest most uptight friend – and paying them for the privilege.

I’m not the only person to have made this observation. Every few weeks a tweet dunking on Airbnb seems to go viral. The latest example comes courtesy of a writer called Jeremy Gordon who got more than 100000 likes for tweeting the following: “Decided to stay in a Holiday Inn instead of an Airbnb for an overnight trip and strongly feel one hour after check-in that there has never been a more luxurious experience in all of human history.”

Let me be clear that I’m not being sponsored by big hotel when I say this (if big hotel would like to sponsor me then please get in contact!) but I’m not sure I’ll ever stay in an Airbnb again. To be fair this is partly because Airbnbs are now obscenely priced and I can’t afford to. Sometimes I look at Airbnbs for fun and then when I find one that seems reasonable I realise it’s actually a tent. Someone has put a bed in a tent in a field and is renting it out for more than $100 a night.

The last time I stayed at an Airbnb was in 2021 before childcare ate all my disposable income. We had a new baby and wanted a relaxing few weeks away from the city so we booked a riverside cottage in the Catskill mountains. As it turns out “relaxing” and “three-month-old baby” don’t really mix. Being greeted with a long list of rules when we arrived didn’t help matters. Some of these rules were reasonable some were not. Do not put drinks on the coffee table! I’m sorry what? It’s a coffee table. The clue is in the name. You put coffee on it. If you have furniture that you don’t want people to put drinks on then don’t rent out your place on Airbnb for a ridiculous amount of money.

There were a few other hiccups with this Airbnb. The hair that had been left in the sink for example. (The host gave us a refund on the $300 cleaning fee.) The broken dishwasher. (The host grumbled then sent a plumber.) And the snake. The first time I went to the basement to use the washing machine I almost stepped on a snake. “Just thought you might want to know a snake lives in your basement!” I messaged the host who was thoroughly sick of us by now. The curt response: “Well it’s the countryside.” That put me in my place didn’t it? I didn’t realise that everyone in the countryside has a snake in their basement. While it may have been no big deal to the owners it made doing the laundry eventful. First I’d pop my head into the staircase and yell: “Hello snake!” to make sure it knew I was coming. Then I had to locate the bloody thing. One day it would be hanging out on the staircase then it would be by the dryer then it would be hiding behind a box. I’m not snakephobic I want to be clear I just don’t want to pay a small fortune to stay somewhere and then have to worry about limbless reptiles slithering over me in the night.

I’m not saying Airbnb is irredeemably awful by the way. I know that being able to let out a room on Airbnb helps some people pay their rent. It helped a couple of my friends in New York pay their rent actually. And then one day a woman arrived and started giving birth on their kitchen floor. Sometimes it pays your rent and gives you great dinner party stories! Other times it makes long-term housing completely unaffordable for normal people because get-rich-quick types have snapped up all the inventory and are charging tourists a small fortune for short-term stays with snakes. Hard to know if it’s good or bad really.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvY2hhbmNlLWVuY291bnRlcnMtZGlzYXN0ZXItYWlyYm5iLWZyaWVuZHMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3RyYXZlbC9hcnRpY2xlL2NoYW5jZS1lbmNvdW50ZXJzLWRpc2FzdGVyLWFpcmJuYi1mcmllbmRz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How an Airbnb disaster led to a beautiful friendship,"CNN —

When a huge plumbing disaster strikes most Airbnb guests would pack their bags and demand their money back while their hosts would glumly write off their profits and try to forget about it.

But for German travelers Elke Thau-Montgomery and Rudi Thau and their American hosts Beth Ann Moon and Jennifer Steinberg a calamitous Airbnb situation turned into a continent-spanning five-years-and-counting friendship.

Florida-based couple Beth and Jennifer listed the apartment connected to their home on Airbnb for the first time in 2017. Beth and Jennifer are gay and were wary about homophobia from their guests (Beth jokes that she hid from the first few bookers.)

But guests from the US and beyond came and went and largely kept to themselves.

Elke and Rudi stood out from the beginning. They were friendly and relaxed and arrived bearing a bottle of gin as a gift.

Elke and Rudi were attracted to Beth and Jennifer’s Airbnb because of its location – near the Everglades in the southern tip of Florida – and Beth and Jennifer’s inviting backyard pool.

But what sealed the deal was the Volkswagen Beetle parked outside. The German couple figured anyone with a VW Beetle was likely to be on their wavelength.

“Let’s go there they must be nice people” Elke recalls thinking.

When Elke and Rudi presented their hosts with the gin Beth went into the house and brought out another bottle from the same distillery about double the size.

“We were laughing at each other” says Elke.

“We hit it off as soon as they arrived” says Beth.

The two couples ended up sitting outside all night drinking and chatting.

“It was really the first time that we had ever connected with people that were here” says Jennifer. “They were just like us we had so many things in common.”

Dealing with a crisis

But then a couple of days later disaster hit. The plumbing in the Airbnb stopped working. To fix the issue Jennifer and Beth had to employ emergency contractors who promptly switched off the water supply and dug a giant hole in the backyard.

“They jack hammered the outside because the ground is made of coral rock” explains Jennifer. “It was quite an interruption. Elke and Rudi couldn’t use the bathroom. It was a bad situation.”

Jennifer and Beth were apologetic. They expected their German visitors would be gone by the next morning.

“Most people I think that were at an Airbnb would demand their money back and demand that we get a hotel for them” says Jennifer. “I didn’t know what to expect. And the next thing I knew they were in our backyard building us a fire pit.”

Rudi and Elke made it clear they weren’t going anywhere unless Jennifer and Beth wanted them to. The Germans weren’t rattled by the mishap finding it entertaining more than anything else.

Elke says they just felt bad for their hosts and their plumbing problems. The fire pit was the first in a series of kind gestures that Elke and Rudi hoped would cheer up a panicked Beth and Jennifer.

And rather than driving their guests out the door the crisis only brought the two couples closer.

“They just became our such close friends” says Jennifer.”They knew we were upset. And they tried to do things around our house to make us feel happy. And they didn’t go anywhere. They stuck with us.”

An arrangement was soon worked out whereby Rudi and Elke could make use of bathrooms in the main house. Evenings were spent sitting around the new fire pit. The two bottles of gin were emptied as the two couples whiled away hours discussing cooking family travels their respective countries and cultures and their thoughts on life politics and friendship.

“We all kind of think the same about things – politics cultural things and stuff” says Elke. “We connected and that was cool.”

Elke and Rudi were avid travelers who always greeted Airbnb hosts with warmth and friendliness. But they’d never bonded with anyone in the way they bonded with Jennifer and Beth.

“We didn’t have an experience like this before and we’re very grateful for it to get some wonderful friends out of that” says Elke.

“I’ll tell you that I never had that experience with anybody” agrees Jennifer. “Due to our ages we never really expected to make such close friends so late in life.”

As Elke and Rudi’s trip wound to a close plans started brewing for Beth and Jennifer to visit Rudi and Elke in Bavaria. Before the German travelers left the Americans booked flights for later that year.

The foursome parted as close friends. And once Rudi and Elke were back home in Germany Beth and Jennifer refunded their stay.

“We knew they wouldn’t accept it if we did it while they were here” says Jennifer.

Friends for life

Several months later the two couples reunited in Germany like no time had passed. Jennifer and Beth loved seeing the country through the eyes of people who live there. They also popped over to Austria and the Czech Republic.

“Neither one of us had ever been to Europe” says Jennifer. “We’ve just been seeing the world and it’s because of Rudi and Elke. There isn’t any way that we could have ever done what we’ve done and what we’ve seen in Europe on our own.”

From there a tradition was established. Every winter Elke and Rudi spend an extended vacation with Beth and Jennifer. And in the fall the Americans return the visit.

Beth and Jennifer no longer rent their space out on Airbnb – it’s reserved for Elke and Rudi plus they’ve since adopted dogs.

Five years on from their first meeting the couples’ loved ones have also met and bonded. Today Rudi Elke Jennifer and Beth see themselves as one extended cross-continental family.

“Even when we go to Germany their family is our family” says Beth.

Rudi and Elke erected a homemade maypole (a tall wooden pole traditionally used in European folk festivals) in their yard in Bavaria topped with a picture of their family. Naturally Jennifer and Beth are included in the illustration.

“It’s just such a kind representation or symbol of our combined cultures and how we feel about each other like family” says Jennifer.

While the two couples bonded from day one they credit the plumbing mishap for cementing their friendship at least in part.

“I don’t know if I can say any one thing was the alchemy that clicked because it just happened. But I think it was the plumbing” says Jennifer. “Maybe we’d be friends anyway. But if we hadn’t had a crisis to get through together it wouldn’t have been the same.”

“Besides that chemistry between people I do believe it’s a little bit the way also we reacted to this little mishap with the plumbers” says Elke. “Rudi and I tried to take it with a lot of humor because things happen it’s just the way of life.”

Right now Rudi and Elke are visiting Beth and Jennifer in the US and the group are busy planning a summer 2023 Croatia vacation. When the friends aren’t physically together they catch up via regular video calls. They see themselves as not just best friends but surrogate family.

And they’re delighted that travel – and more specifically a travel mishap – brought them together.

“Travel and you learn” is how Rudi sums it up.

“You never know who you’re going to meet” says Jennifer “Just be open-minded and let people into your heart.

Do you have enough of the slow loading times and angry customers? The answer you’re looking for might be a content delivery network (CDN)! Research has shown that a 1-second delay in page load time can lead to a 7% decrease in conversions.

By caching and distributing material from servers closer to the user’s location a CDN can make your website load more quickly. In reality according to research by Akamai Technologies employing a CDN can help website performance by as much as 40%.

No one wants to wait any longer in the fast-paced world of today. Because customers may leave your site and possibly visit a competitor’s slow-loading websites will dramatically reduce your reach. Therefore content delivery networks will assist you in attracting customers and delivering a fantastic surfing experience.

An explanation of Content Delivery Networks

A Material Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally disseminated network of computers that is intended to provide users with high availability and performance when delivering content. A CDN’s main duty is to distribute and cache material from the origin server to a network of border servers including pictures videos and other multimedia assets.

This web of servers is placed in data centres all around the world to deliver material to users from the server that is nearest to them. By minimising the physical distance that data must travel the deployment of a CDN enhances the speed and performance of websites and web-based services.

Especially for users who are based far from the origin server this leads to quicker load times and an improved user experience. Additionally CDNs increase content accessibility by distributing it across several servers lowering the possibility of downtime in the possibility of a server failure.

By caching the most often visited files on the edge servers CDN helps to lessen the burden on the main servers and also enhances security by screening out malicious traffic. CDN helps to reduce traffic on the origin server.

The advantages of a Content Delivery Network

The four important benefits that CDNs provide—better performance enhanced reliability cost savings and resilience against cyberattacks—are the main reasons why web applications utilise them.

Performance

Most people think CDNs for the advantage of faster performance and good reason. Websites that begin employing a CDN have shown load time savings of 50% or even more in some circumstances. Reducing the distance between the location where content is stored and the destination; reducing file sizes to speed up loading Accelerating server infrastructure optimization to respond to user demands

Reliability

On occasion things on the Internet go wrong. Network congestion connection interruption and server outages all occur. Even in the face of these issues a CDN allows web applications to continue serving consumers without interruption.

By distributing the network traffic burden CDNs contain any one server from becoming overloaded. A CDN can start a “failover” process to allow a backup server to take over if a single server has a problem. Some CDNs such as the Cloudflare CDN can avoid network congestion much like GPS navigation software may avoid heavy traffic on a motorway.

Saving money

Reducing travels to and from the origin server is the direct method CDNs save costs for website operators. The origin server is spared from delivering the same content repeatedly since CDNs store a large part of a website’s content and provide it from the cache. Rather the CDN carries out this action on the origin server’s behalf.

resilience in the face of harm.

Protection

Websites can be protected by CDNs from DoS and DDoS attacks which are both types of denial-of-service attacks. These attacks attempt to overwhelm and crash a website by sending massive amounts of undesirable network traffic there. Compared to a single origin server CDNs are better able to handle heavy traffic loads and even abnormal traffic surges from DDoS attacks thanks to their numerous servers. By doing this they maintain websites online despite attacks.

Top providers of Content Delivery Networks in 2023

Through a distributed network of proxy servers set up in data centres providers deliver content to end users with high availability and high performance. The list of the top CDNs many of which are used by businesses is presented below.

It is worth considering Albemarle (ALB) which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry.

This specialty chemicals company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.76%.

For the most recent quarter Albemarle was expected to post earnings of $6.84 per share but it reported $7.50 per share instead representing a surprise of 9.65%. For the previous quarter the consensus estimate was $3.03 per share while it actually produced $3.45 per share a surprise of 13.86%.

Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Albemarle lately. In fact the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive which is a great indicator of an earnings beat particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Albemarle currently has an Earnings ESP of +13.91% which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.

Investors should note however that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

(GeekWire File Photo / Kevin Lisota)

[Editor’s Note: Timing of layoffs corrected since original post.]

Citing a need to “align our cost structure with our revenue and where we see customer demand” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees Wednesday that the company will cut 10000 jobs between now and the end of March.

The layoffs represent about 5% of Microsoft’s workforce of more than 220000 employees.

In addition the company will take a $1.2 billion charge in its second fiscal quarter when it releases its full financial results next week. Nadella told employees that the charge is “related to severance costs changes to our hardware portfolio and the cost of lease consolidation as we create higher density across our workspaces.”

The memo did not provide more detail on the areas to be impacted. [Full text below.]

Update: A notice filed with the Washington state Employment Security Department puts the number of job cuts at 878 as of today at Microsoft’s offices in Redmond Bellevue and Issaquah Wash.

Microsoft is “allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness for the company while divesting in other areas” Nadella wrote in the memo to employees.

“These are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our 47-year history to remain a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to anyone who doesn’t adapt to platform shifts” he added.

It’s the second-largest workforce reduction in Microsoft’s history. The company cut 18000 employees in 2014 several months after Nadella became CEO. The majority of those cuts involved Nokia’s Devices & Services business which Microsoft had acquired under Nadella’s predecessor as CEO Steve Ballmer.

With the pandemic causing many of its corporate customers to boost technology spending Microsoft grew substantially to meet the demand. The company added 40000 employees in its 2022 fiscal year ending in June up 22% over the prior year. That brought its total employment to more than 221000 people.

About 45% of the growth 18000 positions came in operations roles which surpassed product research-and-development as Microsoft’s largest category of employment according to numbers included in the company’s annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A big chunk of the growth came through acquisitions including 6500 employees added through the company’s $19.7 billion acquisition of Nuance Communications and another 1500 employees through the acquisition of Xandr the former AT&T advertising technology division.

Microsoft made smaller cutbacks in July and October of last year but nothing on the scale of the latest move. After the July layoffs at the close of its 2022 fiscal year Microsoft said it planned to continue growing headcount.

With the new cutbacks Microsoft becomes the latest tech company to make significant layoffs as the tech sector emerges from the pandemic and faces an uncertain economy. Amazon is laying off 18000 employees or 5% of its corporate workforce. Salesforce which has thousands of employees in the Seattle region recently cut 10% of its headcount. A number of tech startups in the Seattle area are also making layoffs.

Here is the full memo from Satya Nadella to Microsoft employees as sent to employees and published by the company on its official blog.

Subject: Focusing on our short- and long-term opportunity We’re living through times of significant change and as I meet with customers and partners a few things are clear. First as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic we’re now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more with less. We’re also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one. At the same time the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI as we’re turning the world’s most advanced models into a new computing platform. This is the context in which we as a company must strive to deliver results on an ongoing basis while investing in our long-term opportunity. I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive but it requires us to take actions grounded in three priorities. First we will align our cost structure with our revenue and where we see customer demand. Today we are making changes that will result in the reduction of our overall workforce by 10000 jobs through the end of FY23 Q3. This represents less than 5 percent of our total employee base with some notifications happening today. It’s important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. We know this is a challenging time for each person impacted. The senior leadership team and I are committed that as we go through this process we will do so in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible. Second we will continue to invest in strategic areas for our future meaning we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness for the company while divesting in other areas. These are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our 47-year history to remain a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to anyone who doesn’t adapt to platform shifts. As such we are taking a $1.2B charge in Q2 related to severance costs changes to our hardware portfolio and the cost of lease consolidation as we create higher density across our workspaces. And third we will treat our people with dignity and respect and act transparently. These decisions are difficult but necessary. They are especially difficult because they impact people and people’s lives – our colleagues and friends. We are committed to ensuring all those whose roles are eliminated have our full support during these transitions. U.S.-benefit-eligible employees will receive a variety of benefits including above-market severance pay continuing healthcare coverage for six months continued vesting of stock awards for six months career transition services and 60 days’ notice prior to termination regardless of whether such notice is legally required. Benefits for employees outside the U.S. will align with the employment laws in each country. When I think about this moment in time the start of 2023 it’s showtime – for our industry and for Microsoft. As a company our success must be aligned to the world’s success. That means every one of us and every team across the company must raise the bar and perform better than the competition to deliver meaningful innovation that customers communities and countries can truly benefit from. If we deliver on this we will emerge stronger and thrive long into the future; it’s as simple as that. I want to extend my deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has contributed to Microsoft up to this point and to all of you who will continue to contribute as we chart our path ahead. Thank you for the focus dedication and resilience you demonstrate for Microsoft and our customers and partners each day. Satya

Follow-up: Microsoft and Amazon job cuts mark new phase for tech industry after decade of massive growth",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vbWFya2V0aW5nL2FiYm90dC11bnZlaWxzLW1peGVkLXJlYWxpdHktZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1ibG9vZC1kb25vcnMtaXQtbG9va3MtYm9vc3QteW91bmdlci1wZW9wbGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott unveils 'mixed reality' experience for blood donors as it looks to boost younger people's awareness,"Abbott has partnered up with the Blood Centers of America to unveil a mixed-reality VR-like experience for blood donation.

This unique endeavor aims to improve the blood donation process and attract younger people to the give blood globally and shows how new tech can align with campaigning to help bring specific healthcare issues into the public imagination.

“One of the biggest challenges facing the sustainability of our nation’s blood supply over the last decade is the loss of a significant portion of donors under the age of 30 and we think this will appeal to that demographic as well as others looking for a unique experience while giving blood” Patrick O’Connell manager of public affairs at medtech giant Abbott told Fierce Pharma Marketing in an interview.

The technology is the one of the first-ever consumer-focused applications controlled entirely through eye tracking.

Here is how it works: The donor puts on a lightweight mixed-reality headset and enters a digital world. They are however always fully aware of their real-life surroundings. At the same time the healthcare professional drawing the blood can interact with the donor during every step of the process as the donor’s eyes are always visible for monitoring and evaluation.

Mixed reality is like virtual reality but allows users to see the real world around them while in the digital world. Abbott’s mixed reality program uses Microsoft HoloLens 2 a self-contained holographic computer that enables a hands-free interaction with 3D digital objects.

Before starting blood donors are offered a quick tutorial on the headsets and the mixed reality world.

The experience was designed based on research that found using natural settings is most calming for people donating blood. For instance participants can visit gardens full of trees and flowers while listening to soothing music during the experience.

Abbott is working with Blood Centers of America to roll out the new mixed reality experience in the coming months. People can learn more about the experience and when it will be available at a donation site near them by visiting bethe1donor.com/CES. The technology was officially launched at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and a one-day event at New York Blood Center in Brooklyn where about 20 donors were able to try the experience.

One of the motivators behind the innovation is the sustainability of the blood supply around the U.S. which has decreased significantly in the past 10 years. According to Abbott about 3% of the U.S. population donates blood each year and 15% of 18- to 34-year-olds donated blood in 2020.

“About a year ago we leveraged our knowledge of transfusion medicine and technology to come up with the concept of using mixed reality during blood donation as a way to offer a new innovative and immersive digital experience while giving blood” said O’Connell. “It’s a high-tech and creative way to improve the donation experience and make it more appealing for people to participate.”

Among the donors who tried the experience so far 90% said they had a positive experience with the mixed reality according to O’Connell. In addition 85% said the mixed reality was easy to use and 94% said they were likely to donate again using mixed reality.

Participants reported that the experience made the donation process go by faster and provided a calming distraction.

“This innovation is the most recent example of how Abbott is creating leading edge technology to address a key health care need in the world in this case maintaining the blood supply” O’Connell added.

“While we are starting to roll out the mixed reality for use during blood donation we also see potential to take mixed reality beyond donors to the clinical experience including phlebotomists’ training and helping pediatric patients.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vaHJkYWlseWFkdmlzb3IuYmxyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzE3LzUtd2F5cy10by1hbGlnbi1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS13aXRoLWEtY29tcGFueXMtdmFsdWVzLXdoZW4tc2VhcmNoaW5nLWZvci10YWxlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Ways to Align Sustainability with a Company’s Values When Searching for Talent,"Sustainability has become an all-encompassing term to capture how businesses approach timely issues that affect society the environment the economy and even global politics. But it’s not just that everything old is new again; sustainability has evolved and so has the power and reach behind it. Organizations of all kinds are now weaving it throughout their entire business model and at every touch point from sports arenas and the supply chain to HR and even gaming.

From a talent and leadership perspective a company’s size and scope will impact how sustainability is integrated into its culture what objectives are put forth and how to measure success. And yet another consideration is who or what makes the most sense to drive these initiatives as they touch the entire organization—is it establishing a chief sustainability officer or an environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) officer or appointing some other role or group?

There’s also a need for any individual or group in that role to understand how sustainability impacts their specific industry and how to communicate that effectively to multiple audiences. Not only has sustainability become an important issue for prospective hires and current employees but it also makes a statement about a brand its values and how to meet sustainability goals across the board.

Creating Value Through the Three Pillars of Sustainability

When we hear the word “sustainability” most of us think of the environment and what brands are doing to support a green agenda—everything from reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions to biodegradable packaging. But to expand on that there are actually three pillars of sustainability: social sustainability economic sustainability and (of course) environmental sustainability.

So when we also factor in social and economic sustainability the term itself becomes more holistic and has much broader implications for how companies successfully align it to their business objectives. These “value-creating” companies have clear priorities targets and key performance indicators (KPIs) but are also integrating sustainability into corporate culture ensuring employees understand how it positively impacts the company and their individual role in supporting sustainability across the organization.

In my many conversations with CEOs and other leaders sustainability is one of the first things that comes up. Organizations want to know how to become sustainable or practice sustainability in a way that aligns not only with their business goals and values but also with finding and engaging the right talent to support sustainability initiatives. That means for instance also homing in on (social) sustainability à la diversity equity and inclusion so there are several factors at play which begs the question: Where do you begin?

5 Considerations Regarding Sustainability and Attracting Talent

In general there are five high-level areas where CHROs CEOs and other leadership teams need to focus their energy when establishing or strengthening a commitment to sustainability especially when it comes to attracting hiring and retaining talent.

Define clear objectives. One of the first things to do is identify and define relevant sustainability priorities and goals. Does the organization know which of the sustainability pillars it’s trying to address if not all? Also what are key areas of the business where sustainability will have the most impact? Ensure leadership support. This can come in a couple of different flavors: Does the organization have the right leadership to support any (and all) sustainability initiatives? If not what kind of leader or leadership team do you need to ensure success? Does it make sense to appoint a chief sustainability officer or establish some other role to drive related initiatives? Identify the audience. Who (or what) is benefiting from sustainability goals? Is it a matter of getting current employees on board or attracting new talent? Or perhaps there’s a need to highlight sustainability initiatives to consumers/end users to underscore shared values and a mutually beneficial commitment to sustainability? Demonstrate progress. How do you successfully quantify and/or qualify sustainability-related efforts and initiatives? What type of data do you require to set up consistent benchmarks and KPIs that provide an apples-to-apples comparison across the organization? Make it part of the culture. Last and certainly not least what steps need to be taken to ensure sustainability is integrated throughout the business so that every employee is in lockstep? This is where strong leadership is needed from the CEO not only to set the tone but also to identify opportunities and challenges and drive home a clear commitment to sustainability as an integral part of the company’s mission value and goals.

As I mentioned earlier sustainability means different things to different organizations. These top-level considerations are simply meant to help guide HR CEOs and other leaders as they identify specific sustainability needs and wants from leadership and hiring talent to corporate culture and aligning KPIs.

And despite a lack of a one-size-fits-all approach to sustainability there are some fundamental elements such as a commitment to transparency and knowledge-sharing. By combining these elements with the three pillars of sustainability and clearly identified objectives organizations will not only create value but also embody it as we collectively work toward a sustainable future.

Credit: Ewa Urban / Pixabay.

Research in the UK has found that a new kind of ten-minute CT scan can enable the detection and treatment of one of the most common causes of hypertension.

Doctors at Queen Mary University of London and Barts Hospital as well as Cambridge University Hospital have undertaken research leveraging the CT scan to light up tiny growths known as nodules in a hormone gland and cure high blood pressure by surgically removing them.

The nodules are found in one-in-twenty people suffering from high blood pressure.

The study on the new scan was undertaken on a total of 128 patients at Barts Hospital Cambridge University Hospital and Guy’s and St Thomas’s as well as the Universities of Glasgow and Birmingham.

It was funded by a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and Medical Research Council (MRC) along with Barts Charity and the British Heart Foundation.

The doctors discovered that hypertension (high blood pressure) in some patients was caused by a gene mutation that resulted in high levels of a steroid hormone aldosterone.

In two-thirds of patients with high aldosterone secretion it was found to be coming from a benign nodule present in just one of the adrenal glands which could then be removed in a safe manner.

The new scan leverages a short-acting dose of metomidate which is a radioactive dye that binds only to the aldosterone-generating nodule.

Patients found to have excessive levels of aldosterone in the blood are resistant to treatment with drugs for hypertension and are at high risk of heart attacks and strokes.

The scan was found to be as precise as the standard of care catheter test however it was quicker more painless and technically ‘successful’ in each patient.

Furthermore the catheter test could not predict the patients that could be fully cured of hypertension with the removal of the gland through surgery.

The mix of a ‘hot nodule’ on the scan and urine steroid test predicted 18 of the 24 patients that attained normal blood pressure off all their medicines following surgery.

The research tackles a six-decade-old issue of detecting the hormone-generating nodules without a difficult catheter study which is found only in a few hospitals and often leads to failure.

Queen Mary University of London professor of endocrine hypertension and co-senior author of the study Morris Brown said: “These aldosterone-producing nodules are very small and easily overlooked on a regular CT scan. When they glow for a few minutes after our injection they are revealed as the obvious cause of hypertension which can often then be cured. Until now 99% are never diagnosed because of the difficulty and unavailability of tests. Hopefully this is about to change.”"

Burns & McDonnell has completed engineer-procure-construct (EPC) services for three Alliant Energy solar projects in Wisconsin totaling 250 MWac.

Representing part of Alliant Energy’s Clean Energy Blueprint the energized projects are:

Despite tariffs on Asian-manufactured solar panels that caused many developers to pause their projects between late 2021 and the first half of 2022 Alliant Energy chose to keep these initial three projects moving forward. Alliant Energy maintained progress in its program thanks to a series of proactive steps that included procurement of 1.5 million bifacial PV modules in advance of the tariff-related uncertainty that emerged. Thanks to close collaboration between Alliant Energy and the integrated EPC team critical paths for long-lead items were identified along with innovative engineering that enabled construction scheduling efficiencies.

“Big thoughts go nowhere without bold actions” said Doug Riedel senior vice president of renewables at Burns & McDonnell. “Alliant Energy took the bold actions needed to keep these projects moving forward and fulfilling commitments to make its Clean Energy Blueprint a reality.”

The three projects were completed with an exemplary safety record despite difficult winter weather conditions. Not only did the projects achieve zero OSHA recordable incidents but established safety procedures also were credited for life-saving measures for a construction team member who experienced a cardiac arrest on the Wood County jobsite.

“Keeping everyone who sets foot on our jobsites safe is our expectation on every one of our projects and achieving that outcome requires an extreme focus on safety by all including a great owner partner executives project management front line supervision and tradespeople” said Matt Ralston senior vice president of the construction group at Burns & McDonnell.

As part of a commitment to support the local employment base an apprenticeship program was instituted through AZCO the union construction subsidiary of Burns & McDonnell. The program provided field-based training and hands-on experience to 78 apprentices across the program. AZCO has sponsored apprenticeships to 12 Apprentice Operating Engineers and 13 Apprentice NCSRCC Carpenters. Of AZCO’s total workforce for the program to date 87% are Wisconsin residents. Additionally multiple tours were held for local high school and secondary trade school students emphasizing the pathways for entering the trades.

Burns & McDonnell has now mobilized on six additional solar sites included in Alliant Energy’s Clean Energy Blueprint. These projects are advancing as scheduled thanks to an integrated EPC contract framework.

When complete the nine solar facilities will span nearly 5000 acres and add 664 MWac in total solar capacity to the regional grid. Over the duration of the program more than 600 Burns & McDonnell employee-owners and approximately 870 crafts and trades are expected to be deployed to the project sites.

These equipment manufacturers and suppliers are key partners contributing to the project:

The solar projects also created several opportunities to give back to various communities where they are located. A 2022 charity golf tournament in Cottage Grove raised more than $30000 for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Wisconsin with additional goods and funds donated to various local food pantries schools and other community-based organizations.

In this issue we talk with Angela Arrington.

Arrington is a 2002 graduate of the Maurer School of Law at the University of Indiana. She is now corporate counsel at Alliant Energy Corp. in Madison and previously served as an administrative law judge in the unemployment insurance division.

1. Tell me about what you do as an in-house counsel for Alliant Energy.



I am currently a corporate attorney-manager. It is an in-house counsel role. My role focuses on providing legal support throughout the company on a variety of business matters. I spend a significant amount of time working towards successful business solutions that stem from the legal support I provide. I work with staff within the company including executive leadership. I also work with external partners such as outside counsel and various compliance and utility partners.

Primarily the areas I provide legal support in are employment/labor compliance records management litigation and crisis management/emergency response.

2. What skill set is required to find success as an in-house counsel?

I would say a major skill set required to find success as an in-house counsel is to first diversify the type of law you practice. In my day-to-day various legal issues will come my way and it helps that I have practical experience from previous roles I have held. Even if I don't have practical experience in a specific subject area I am used to being able to handle and balance a variety of legal subjects at the same time which helps in addressing issues especially since many can be time sensitive.

Additional skill sets that can be beneficial to one's success are to be a great listener being able to work well with others (i.e. easy to talk to teamwork mentality) have good communication skills good organizational skills and be solution oriented. It makes the work flow a lot easier when you have the interpersonal skills combined with the legal skills to do the work.

3. How important is industry knowledge to your role?

Having industry knowledge when you come into an in-house counsel role is always a good thing but it is often not a requirement in order to be in the role for many companies/organizations. However in order to be effective as an in-house counsel it is important to gain as much industry knowledge as you can.

Industry knowledge helps you understand the industry better which in turn helps with the legal support and business solutions that follow. One of the best ways to do so is to become a member of various industry partner organizations that can provide you relevant up-to-date information on trends issues benchmarking that are occurring around the industry. Being a member of these partner organizations has provided me with excellent learning opportunities that keep me ""in the know"" of what is happening in the utility space which then leads to a better result with how I support business units/departments within the company.

4. When might outside counsel be brought in?

Outside counsel are attorneys that work outside the company (i.e. law firms solo practitioners and their legal support staff). Outside counsel provide supplemental legal support to the company. Outside counsel are usually brought in to work on specific practice areas that are of interest to the company.

In-house counsel has the responsibility of managing the work of the outside counsel. That simply means that we are working closely on ensuring that the outside counsel matches the needs of the company and will yield the best results. Outside counsel relationships are excellent to have also for helping to learn more about trends/issues in a certain subject area. They are also very helpful for thought partnership for all kinds of business and legal strategies that the company may want to engage in.

5. What does a typical day look like for you?

A typical day for me involves different meetings across the company on a range of legal issues or business solutions. The meetings often range from 15 minutes to an hour. I also spend time drafting documents (i.e. letters litigation matters contractual agreements and policies/procedures). There are several times on a daily basis where I may be working on records information management or compliance issues related to the company.

6. Tell me about the path to your current role.



After graduating from Indiana-Bloomington School of Law I started in private practice with a general practice law firm and then went on to work for the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) as a prosecuting attorney and executive director. When I worked for DSPS I dealt with at least fifteen business and design professions that included barbering and cosmetology professional engineers funeral directors/establishments land surveyors and auctioneers.

I also worked as an administrative law judge for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development Unemployment Insurance Division. During my tenure I heard thousands of cases which required me to not only develop expertise on different aspects of the employment/labor relationship between employees and employers but also be astute in working with people from diverse backgrounds.

7. How can one best prepare to move into an in-house counsel role?

What's really important is to develop a diverse portfolio of practice areas. Don't limit yourself to simply one or two areas and then end up stuck there. Try to grow in a different practice area at least every few years. A great way to do this is in pro bono work where you volunteer in the community and learn areas of law that you may not have normally come across in your day-to-day employment. Also be adaptable in your approach to what can bring about a positive and successful result.

8. What do you do for fun outside of work?

I love to travel spend time with family and being active in serving my community. Currently I serve as the Wisconsin State Social Action Liaison in Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated and as Chair of the Board of Directors for the YWCA Madison. I am also involved with the Madison Metropolitan Chapter of the Links Incorporated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3dyZXN0bGluZy93aWxsaWFtc2J1cmctc2Vlcy1zdGVhZHktaW1wcm92ZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1oYXJkd29ya2luZy1hbmQtcXVpZXQtYXBwcm9hY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Williamsburg sees steady improvement with ‘hardworking and quiet’ approach,"Williamsburg’s boys’ wrestling season started with some uncertainty.

New faces dotted the Raiders’ young and inexperienced lineup. Williamsburg Coach Grant Eckenrod was optimistic but had some questions.

“You have some goals and hope you can be there at the end of the year” Eckenrod said. “There were a lot of unknowns.”

Strong work ethic and a business-like approach has propelled the Raiders to No. 7 in the latest Iowa Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association Class 2A dual rankings earning a chance to host a regional duals site on Jan. 31.

Williamsburg opened the season with a loss to No. 4 Mount Vernon but has climbed to 18-3 overall without another loss to a 2A program.

“Our kids have just continually gotten better” Eckenrod said. “It has been fun to watch.

“We’ve had kids in and out of the lineup. I don’t think we’ve put our best lineup together yet. Hopefully we can get that done soon.”

The Raiders have 10 wrestlers with winning records. Seven of them have surpassed 20 victories including senior 2021 state runner-up Gavin Jensen who leads the team with a 26-4 mark. They have done it with a blue-collar approach. Think hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.

“I’m very pleased with how these kids have come along and how they’ve improved” Eckenrod said. “It’s been an awesome group to work with. They are a hardworking and quiet bunch. Not a lot of hoorah and emotional-type guys. They come to practice work their tails off and are great kids.”

The sum of the whole is greater than the parts and the Raiders seem stronger in dual competition. Williamsburg does have two ranked wrestlers. Jensen is third at 120 and senior Gable Dayton is ninth at 182.

Dayton won Benton Community’s Bobcat Jerry Eckenrod Invitational and was a runner-up last weekend at the Loyd Shaffer-Marion Invitational. He has been a leader by example for the program.

“He’s a super quiet kid and does what he’s supposed to do” Eckenrod said. “The kid has put in some extra time. We’ve got to have those guys where you see them in the offseason. They’re in the weight room and get some extra mat time. A lot of these guys are doing that and will be more successful.

“Gable is one of those guys. He’s had a heck of a football season. It has just carried over to wrestling.”

Williamsburg is one of three Wamac Conference programs that will host regional duals. No. 3 West Delaware and Mount Vernon will also host state duals qualifiers. No. 12 Independence is expected to be in the field. Benton Community and South Tama are just on the outside of the top 24 in 2A giving the strong Wamac a possibility of six teams in the field.

“The Wamac is loaded not only in wrestling but everything” Eckenrod said. “You have to have to have that great competition. You have to be in serious battles during the regular season. It gets you ready for the postseason.”

Other Gazette-area hosts will be No. 5 Linn-Mar in 3A and Alburnett and Lisbon in 1A.

Jillian Worthen among No. 1-ranked wrestlers

Four Gazette-area wrestlers earned No. 1 rankings in the latest IAwrestle rankings released Wednesday.

Union Community sophomore Jillian Worthen is the top-ranked 105-pounder. The returning IWCOA girls’ state champion improved to 20-0 this season winning the Oelwein girls’ tournament.

Sophomores Mackenzie Childers of Cedar Rapids Prairie and Emma Peach of Iowa Valley are ranked first at 125 and 145 respectively. Decorah junior Naomi Simon is top-ranked at 170.

The Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union super regionals are Jan. 27. Alliant Energy PowerHouse in Cedar Rapids and Luther College in Decorah will each host two regionals. The inaugural IGHSAU state tournament is Feb. 2-3 at Xtream Arena in Coralville.

Maquoketa Valley’s big trio

Maquoketa Valley swept the final three titles Saturday at the MFL MarMac Invitational in Monona. Nathan Bietz (195) Brady Davis at 220 and heavyweight Aiden Salow earned crowns for the Wildcats.

Davis and Salow pinned their way through the tournament. Bietz reached the finals with two pins before a 7-1 decision over Ryan McCartney of Lancaster (Wis.) for the championship.

The trio is a combined 68-9 this season. Bietz is ranked seventh in 1A while Davis is sixth.

(KGUN) — Drivers are likely to pay more for car insurance in 2023. The average annual rate increase across the U.S. is 8.4% compared to the 1.3% from what we saw in 2022.

Arizona is set to have the second highest increase in car insurance rates of all states in the U.S. this year.

Arizona’s year-over-year rate increase is 15.6% which is a big change from the 3.8% we saw in 2021. Illinois is coming in at number one with 17.1%

Local insurance agents are saying this auto insurance rate increase isn’t too much of a surprise since people are starting to drive more and the cost of labor and material is a lot higher for auto companies right now.

“Projecting 2023 is difficult because we are seeing things happen that I haven’t seen in 16 years like cars appreciating which is still happening"" saidBrittni Gutman Allstate Insurance Agency LLC.

Gutman explains that Arizona has a large population of uninsured drivers that also could be impacting how much you are paying each month for insurance. She advises customers to shop around for insurance and always revise your policy as rates across the nation continue to increase.

Arizona drivers will see rate changes in 2023 when their policies are up for renewal and to put it into perspective for you the average cost of full coverage car insurance for this year is $1780 per year."
