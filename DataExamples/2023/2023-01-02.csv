3M announced in December that it’s phasing out a family of harmful chemicals but they’re not going away.

The “forever chemicals” known collectively as per- and polyfluorinated substances or PFAS are used in everything from carpeting to nonstick pans to dental floss. The chains of carbon-fluorine bonds are excellent at repelling stains grease and water and even snuffing out dangerous fuel fires. But they also don’t break down in the environment and they linger in people’s bodies for years.

Research has linked the chemicals to developmental and immune problems fertility issues and some cancers.

Maplewood Minnesota-based 3M which is facing a cascade of lawsuits over the PFAS it helped pioneer in the last century said it would stop making and using them by 2025 including at its plant in Cottage Grove Minnesota.

In the view of Rainer Lohmann director of the University of Rhode Island’s STEEP lab and an authority on PFAS contamination: “The nightmare hasn’t really stopped.”

Researchers and environmental advocates said the persistence and global scope of the pollution from the chemicals will pose a cleanup challenge for years to come. They also worried new manufacturers could step in to fill a gap left by 3M and they said the company should contribute to environmental cleanup.

“While it is great that they are moving away from these chemicals finally after pressure after liability after pressure from government regulators … they certainly should not be left off the hook for accountability” said Melanie Benesh vice president for government affairs with the Environmental Working Group an advocacy organization.

3M has already been engaged in cleanup efforts in connection with legal cases and environmental enforcement. It paid the state of Minnesota $850 million to settle a lawsuit over natural resource damages in 2018 and before that it had to excavate contaminated material from several dumps used by its chemical plant in the east Twin Cities metropolitan area. The company also entered into a consent agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency this November to test and treat drinking water in a 10-mile area around its chemical plant in Cordova Ill.

It also faces continuing scrutiny around its Cottage Grove plant where there’s an open investigation into its water discharges by the EPA and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. 3M first revealed the investigation to investors in 2020.

MPCA spokeswoman Andrea Cournoyer declined to comment on the inquiry.

In an email she wrote that the agency “welcomes” 3M’s plan to stop production and that it “will continue to hold 3M and other entities accountable for their PFAS pollution as appropriate.”

Sean Lynch a spokesman for 3M also declined to comment on the investigation.

He wrote in an email that the company “will continue to fulfill its commitments to water stewardship as well as remediation of PFOA and PFOS at certain locations where we manufactured or disposed of these materials.”

New technologies are being tested to clean up PFAS — including a machine designed to concentrate the chemicals in foam on top of water which the MPCA is using in the east metro.

But there are still few known ways to destroy the chemicals and they’re so routinely found that researchers often refer to a “background level” that’s present in the blood of most people.

“Any place we do find it we basically know it was put there by someone or some process we created” said Matt Simcik a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Minnesota who has studied PFAS contamination for decades.

3M is still coping with the legacy of two of the oldest and best-studied formulations of the chemicals PFOS and PFOA. The company announced in 2000 that it would phase them out. But other companies such as DuPont didn’t until much later. The chemicals are routinely found around the planet today. One recent study revealed such high levels in rainwater that they exceeded limits set for drinking water by the EPA.

“PFOS was very much a 3M product and we’re still worrying about it 20 years after they phased it out” Lohmann said.

The contamination problem is a more complex one than other prominent contaminants such as PCBs Simcik said. The hazardous organic chemicals were used widely in electronics finishes and plastics until their manufacture was banned in the United States in 1979. They tend to stick to particles so over time some of the PCBs left in the environment in places like the Great Lakes have settled into soils and been covered Simcik said.

“That big chunk is still down there and buried so it’s not a problem” he said.

That’s not the case with PFAS which move readily through water and keep coming into contact with people and animals.

Then there’s the question of what could replace the chemicals. Simcik and Lohmann both worried about what the properties of new chemicals could be.

3M has not divulged how it will replace the chemicals that provide $1.3 billion in annual sales.

Asked whether the company would do health or safety testing on PFAS replacements Lynch wrote that “3M is committing to innovate toward a world less dependent upon PFAS. 3M’s products are safe for their intended uses.”

The other main manufacturer in the United States is Chemours a spin-off of DuPont which has used several formulations of PFAS in its line of Teflon products.

Asked whether the company was considering stepping away from PFAS spokeswoman Cassie Olszewski wrote in an email “Chemours is committed to fluorine chemistry and its power to enable world-changing technologies that help solve some of the world’s most challenging problems.”

You can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here.

In the face of continued legal action from states across the country 3M a Fortune 500 manufacturing company will discontinue the use of “forever chemicals” by 2025.

3M makes Scotchgard and other water-repellent products which contain a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS that do not break down in the environment. PFAS has been found in nearly every state in the country and in everything from polar bears to fast food wrappers. Research has shown a link between these chemicals and public health concerns such as high blood pressure in mid-life women stunted developmental growth infertility as well as kidney liver and testicular cancers.

In a statement the St.Paul-based company said the decision comes on the heels of an “evolving external landscape” which includes increased regulatory pressures. In the past year the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA released a PFAS Strategic Roadmap which plans to create new policies to protect public health and the environment while holding polluters accountable. In addition to the increased federal pressure 3M has been the target of various lawsuits directed at PFAS manufacturers.

California announced a lawsuit in November that alleges 3M DuPont and other PFAS producers have caused far-reaching damage to public health and the environment by dealing in products laced with “forever chemicals.” The lawsuit is similar to a dozen others filed in states across the country. While the lawsuits are mounting 3M’s awareness of their production problem has been festering for decades.

As early as the 1970s the manufacturing company knew that PFAS was accumulating in human bloodstreams. According to The Intercept 3M was sued by its home state of Minnesota in 2010 and settled the suit for $850 million which lead to a mountain of internal documents memos and research to be released by the state’s Attorney General’s Office showing exactly what the company knew about the harm of the products it produced.

Minnesotans are still grappling with the potential health effects of PFAS which has had devastating effects on the area’s youth. According to the Minnesota Reformer a study of children who died between 2003 and 2015 in Oakdale a Twin Cities suburb found that a child who died there was 171% more likely to have had cancer than a child who died in the surrounding area. The state of Minnesota alleges that PFAS made its way into the area’s groundwater after decades of 3M discarding PFAS-contaminated waste products in unlined dump sites.

The EPA announced in November that PFAS pollution from 3M had caused an “imminent and substantial endangerment” of the drinking water for nearly 300000 people in the Quad Cities region of Illinois and Iowa and ordered an investigation into 3M’s role in the pollution.

In 2000 3M pledged to stop the use of two specific strains of PFAS chemicals in their production process but the company argued in its recent announcement that the continued use of PFAS was “critical” to make products necessary for modern life such as medical technology phones and automobiles. Legal experts estimate future litigation could cost the company upwards of $30 billion.

In the wake of the announcement environmental groups say the decision is long overdue and hope that the company is still responsible for decades of inaction and harm to the public.

“This is a big win for public health and the environment” Mike Schade a program director for the nonprofit Toxic-Free Future told Grist. “3M historically has been one of the biggest PFAS polluters not only here in the US but globally and for decades they have proceed and released massive amounts of PFAS that have contaminated communities water supplies fish and wildlife all across the planet”

Schade said that this decision is part of a growing trend of major corporations abandoning PFAS in their manufacturing process. While the manufacturers are looking at a PFAS-free future he noted that downstream businesses like clothing companies that still trade in these chemicals should stop the trail of toxic pollution. He said it’s likely that more companies will be looking for PFAS alternatives and the EPA and industry regulators should remain vigilant that the chemicals these companies replace PFAS with aren’t bound to create the same harms already documented by the forever chemicals.

“In the years going forward we’re going to be seeing hundreds of communities that have to clean up toxic chemicals"" Schade said “and 3M must be held financially liable for that pollution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0bGFrZXNub3cub3JnLzIwMjMvMDEvcGZhcy1uZXdzLXJvdW5kdXAtM20tc3RvcC1mb3JldmVyLWNoZW1pY2Fscy0yMDI1LWdsb2JhbC1wcm9ibGVtLXJlbWFpbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PFAS News Roundup: 3M says it will stop making 'forever chemicals' by 2025 but global problem remains,"PFAS short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a group of widespread man-made chemicals that don’t break down in the environment or the human body and have been flagged as a major contaminant in sources of water across the country.

A new map reveals waste from fracking wells that used PFAS has been dumped at dozens of sites in Ohio Pennsylvania and West Virginia and could potentially contaminate soil and groundwater.

Wisconsin

3M Co. made the historic announcement that it is leaving the business of manufacturing “forever chemicals” — a multibillion dollar industry the company helped found nearly six decades ago. The conglomerate behind Post-It notes and Scotch tape will stop making controversial PFAS substances by the end of 2025.

3M is named as a defendant in more than 3500 PFAS-related lawsuits. It will cease production of all PFAS by the end of 2025 due to a confluence of reasons that includes shifting industry desires and accelerating regulatory trends. But the company is facing a deluge of litigation that won’t end when production does.

Billions in eventual legal settlements with 3M could cover PFAS forever chemicals testing cleanup and health costs.

(Emily Mesner / ADN)

In Anchorage some families are feeling cautious relief as their neighborhood elementary school is set to remain open next year. Others are reckoning with the closure of one local school starting next fall.

In October the Anchorage School District recommended closing six neighborhood elementary schools citing both a budget crunch and continually dropping enrollment. For months uncertainty loomed. There was a series of packed emotional public meetings. Would Klatt Birchwood Nunaka Valley Northwood Abbott Loop or Wonder Park elementary schools be open on the first day of classes next year?

The decision is ultimately up to the school board and members indicated in December that they planned to close only Abbott Loop while keeping the others open for the time being.

Closing Abbott Loop would save the district nearly $1 million for each of the first two years after its closure. Unlike other schools on the closure list which officials had suggested turning into charter schools or preschool academies Abbott Loop would instead be transitioned back to the municipality which owns the property. Board members mostly agreed that amid likely future budget woes the school’s closure was inevitable.

For Rick Whitbeck who is the president of the parent-teacher organization at Abbott Loop and whose son goes to school there the decision last month “was nothing short of disgusting to me.”

“I don’t think they’re going back on that decision” Whitbeck said. “Certainly my plea would be: Go back on that decision and don’t single out our kids.”

Whitbeck said the roughly $974000 saved by closing Abbott Loop makes it seem like officials are saying that the school and its families are disposable. Even if the closure was inevitable Whitbeck said singling out one school and not waiting a year is bad policy.

“We’re the throwaway kids” he said.

‘The biggest concern is that we try to do this right’

Board president Margo Bellamy said her decision to vote in favor of guidance that would close Abbott Loop took into account low enrollment and limited resources the amount of work the elementary school building needs how close neighboring schools are to Abbott Loop and that the closure could provide the ability to increase access to certain programs and specialists.

The school district and school board face a $48 million budget deficit caused by a mix of mostly flat state education funding inflation and a dropoff in federal pandemic funding.

Board members approved a series of preliminary cuts closures and other methods to help solve the shortfall as guidance for district officials who said they needed to know which schools would be open next year. But board members won’t vote on a final budget until February.

Whitbeck said his concern now is making sure that the Abbott Loop closure won’t result in families falling through the cracks.

“If it’s only one school and we’re the lab rat then you better make sure that the experiment doesn’t fail” he said.

The Anchorage School District doesn’t have a lot of experience closing schools said school board member Andy Holleman. Holleman initially voted in favor of a failed motion to keep all schools open next year then ultimately voted for the closure.

“The biggest concern is that we try to do this right” Holleman said.

The district is going to close more schools in the future he said.

“This is going to be with us for a while” Holleman said. “If we just closed one school this year then we absolutely will be back looking at more unless the public stood up and said ‘No the local neighborhood schools are important enough to us that we will fund a district even if it’s running somewhat inefficiently’ and I don’t think that’s gonna happen.”

Anchorage supports good education but residents want to feel like it’s carried out in an efficient way he said.

“I think this is an adjustment we’re gonna go through but it’s gonna matter to try to do it in a way that does the least harm” Holleman said.

Concern for low-income students and families

Abbott Loop — along with all but one of the other schools initially recommended for closure — is a Title I school which means the school’s roughly 250 students receive certain benefits because a majority of students come from low-income households.

According to Whitbeck who is a parent representative on both state and district Title I committees there are more than 100 families at the school that rely on Title I services including child care migrant education counseling and free breakfast and lunch. It’s not yet clear whether Trailside and Kasuun the two schools Abbott Loop students will be transferred to will gain Title I status.

Families may now need to individually fill out paperwork to qualify and register for those services.

Patrick Hopstad whose older daughter went to Abbott Loop and whose younger daughter is in school there now said the demographics of the schools recommended for closure should have been considered.

“As a Title I school you can already imagine some of these families are hurting more than others” Hopstad said.

Some students already have adverse childhood experiences and throwing in a new school a new experience and a new culture “could very well make it harder for some of these kids who are already going through hard times” he said.

‘This isn’t over’

Meanwhile families and advocates of the five schools that the board opted to keep open breathed a sigh of relief after the school board’s vote.

“We are all super happy and excited that it’s not closing. But we are kind of like ‘Well what about the next year and the following year?’ ” said Airis Messick PTA president and parent of a student at Northwood.

Jessica Louwerse PTA president at Klatt Elementary with a son and daughter attending the school said that there was a desire among families and staff to reach a decision and proceed which has provided more solid footing.

There’s some excitement that their voices were heard she said and the school community can go back to focusing on academics.

“There’s still kind of a lingering sense of this isn’t over for the whole school district” Louwerse said. “Klatt’s in a really good place and everyone’s pretty excited to be able to settle back into a normal rhythm and to move forward with the exciting things that we have been planning but still recognizing that the district has a lot of big decisions ahead of them and that families across the community are going to be impacted one way or another.”

Louwerse said she’s now shifting her focus to advocate on a statewide level to show legislators the importance of increasing the per-student funding the state provides to districts around Alaska. She noticed that over the months of public meetings while school closures were being debated people primarily being impacted tended to step forward.

“But really as I’ve understood the recommendations by the district I recognize that it really is a community-level impact” she said.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy did not include an increase to education funding in his recently proposed budget in December though he acknowledged “there are inflationary issues that need to be addressed” for the state’s schools. Anchorage School District Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt said in a statement that the governor’s recognition of that pressure on schools was encouraging and that he looked forward to working with both legislators and the governor on the issue.

Louwerse said she encourages families in the district to advocate whether or not their programs or schools are currently on the chopping block.

“Our voices collectively can make a really big difference in keeping and then expanding the programs that the district can offer our kiddos” she said. “And that even if they weren’t on the list now it could be next year if nothing changes.”

Greg Abbott boasts busing 16K migrants to sanctuary cities,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bragged Monday about busing more than 16000 migrants from the Lone Star State to so-called “sanctuary cities” following a year of controversial relocations of migrants coming across the southern US border.

“Texas has bused more than 16300 migrants to sanctuary cities” Abbott tweeted adding the move was meant to relieve Texas cities overwhelmed by what he called “President Biden’s open border policies.”

“Over 9100 to DC. Over 4900 to NYC. Over 1500 to Chicago. Over 840 to Philadelphia” the governor boasted.

Three busloads of shivering people were most recently dropped at the doorstep of Vice President Kamala Harris on Dec. 24 — the coldest Christmas Eve on record — in the nation’s capital. Many were dressed in T-shirts in the 18-degree weather according to local reports.

Abbott began his vehicular vendetta in April busing migrants from Texas border communities to cities like DC and New York  as a way of highlighting the migrant crisis to both politicians and citizens in Democrat-run cities away from the border.

The governor has notoriously refused to notify mayoral offices or aid organizations in the destination cities. New York Mayor Eric Adams said he was blindsided when migrants started showing up in the Big Apple in August.

“For months Texas has callously used asylum seekers as political pawns and this latest stunt is just another example of the cruel behavior coming from Governor Abbot and his administration” Fabien Levy an Adams spokesman said in a statement last week.

Abbott did not specify in his tweet which federal policies he deemed “open border” policies.

3 Abbott said a majority of the migrants were sent by bus to Washington DC.

In an open letter ahead of last month’s winter storms Abbott blamed the situation at the border squarely on the president.

“This terrible crisis for border communities in Texas is a catastrophe of your own making” the letter said.

“These communities and the state are ill-equipped to do the job assigned to the federal government — house the thousands of migrants flooding into the country every day. With perilous temperatures moving into the area many of these migrants are at risk of freezing to death on city streets” Abbott continued.

“The need to address this crisis is not the job of border states like Texas. Instead the U.S. Constitution dictates that it is your job Mr. President to defend the borders of our country regulate our nation’s immigration and manage those who seek refuge here.”

The political jousting comes amid a fight over Title 42 a pandemic restriction allowing the federal government to restrict entry into the US in order to curb the spread of disease.

The law was invoked by President Donald Trump at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and was used to block nearly all asylum claims. The Biden administration continued to enforce Title 42 but only against certain asylum seekers who could be expelled to Mexico.

The Biden administration had tried to lift the restriction in May but the effort was blocked in federal court.

A different federal judge ruled in November that Title 42 was meant to be a health restriction — not longstanding immigration policy — and ordered the Biden administration to lift the policy by December 21.

The Supreme Court weighed in last week ordering that the pandemic restriction be kept in place for at least two months pending arguments before the nation’s high court.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9wcml2YWN5L2FiYm90dC1jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tY2xhaW1zLWNvbXBhbnktc2hhcmVkLXBhdGllbnQtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24td2l0aG91dC1jb25zZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott class action claims company shared patient information without consent,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9wcml2YWN5L2FiYm90dC1jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tY2xhaW1zLWNvbXBhbnktc2hhcmVkLXBhdGllbnQtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24td2l0aG91dC1jb25zZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EBF730>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Stars of 'Abbott Elementary' Have Impressive Net Worths,"When it comes to popular sitcoms Abbott Elementary is at the top of the list! The beloved ABC series created by Quinta Brunson premiered in December 2021 and its viewership has been on a steady rise ever since. In fact Abbott Elementary snagged a whopping seven nominations at the 2022 Emmy Awards. By the end of the night Abbott Elementary went home with three big wins: Outstanding Cast for a Comedy Series Sheryl Lee Ralph as Barbara Howard for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and ""Pilot"" for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. While Abbott Elementary is hardly the only successful comedy series in the last decade Quinta was determined to make sure the series landed on network television vs. a streaming platform like Netflix or Hulu. ""I was very interested in it being on network TV specifically ABC because I just think that ABC represents family viewing. I think that streaming and everything is fine but I do think streaming Netflix or Hulu or even HBO Max is not necessarily geared toward the family viewer. I think they have been trying to crack that for a while"" the Philadelphia native explained in a June 2022 interview with Deadline. ""What do shows look like for people who are both 55 and 25 to watch together at the same time? And I just don’t think that streaming has really captured that yet. And I think people still look to network for those kinds of shows. And I knew that Abbott was a show like that. I knew that it was meant to be seen by many different people. And I wanted that for it"" Quinta continued. The She Memes Well: Essays author went on to express her gratitude over Abbott Elementary truly being a family show. ""One of my favorite things to hear is when people say 'My gosh this is what I watch with my family it’s the only thing I can watch with my children.' And younger people being like 'I’ve been watching it with my grandma we both love it.' That’s what I still feel you can get from network you know? I think that’s still unique to that space"" Quinta said. Catch new episodes of Abbott Elementary on ABC on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.

The Australian branch of professional services firm Accenture continues to boost its leadership stocks both through promotions and external hires – including returning employees.

With more than 1200 Accenture professionals worldwide having commenced the new year as managing directors at the firm it’s perhaps not practical to name them all individually in a single press release – leaving those to share their own happy news on LinkedIn.

In addition to the promotions already made public a further handful of Australia-based consultants have since made personal announcements.

Along with the managing director promotions of Matthew Chambers Triston Boyd Ajay Nair Helen Nicholas and Chris Venus Accenture has also welcomed back two new recruits in key positions with Ling Pang returning to the firm to take on the role of deputy Chief Financial Officer and Manon Bosma arriving back from Europe to co-lead Accenture’s Leadership & Culture offering for the Asia Pacific.

After spending the past year as general manager of finance and corporate services at Indigenous non-profit organisation Jawun (which counts BCG and KPMG among its partners) Ling Pang has returned to Accenture to take on the deputy CFO role. She previously spent more than nine years with the firm across two stints in various finance leads and also spent over three years as a management accountant at BCG.

Manon Bosma also rejoins Accenture’s Melbourne office to co-lead its Talent & Organisation/Human Potential practice for the APAC region after having most recently led the firm’s HR Transformation business in Europe. Bosma has been with Accenture for close to two decades originally joining in Geneva in 2005. Previously she spent three years as an organisational consultant with Vodafone in the Netherlands.

Another one-time returnee Matthew Chambers rejoined Accenture in early 2021 after having previously spent close to seven years in its Sydney office till 2000 in the interim serving as regional vice president for nCino APAC sales. A member of Accenture’s Salesforce Business Group from close to its inception Chambers has over 15 years of Salesforce experience. He previously worked for Deloitte Consulting in the United Kingdom.

Accenture’s ANZ market pricing lead and former APAC finance lead Triston Boyd has been with the global firm for close to two decades first joining in Dallas in 2004 before eight years later crossing to Accenture’s Melbourne office. Earlier he spent five years as a financial analyst with EDS in Texas. In his present role Boyd supports clients with pricing financial deal structuring negotiations and GAAP compliance.

Yet another consultant who couldn’t resist the lure of Accenture Ajay Nair has spent close to fifteen years at the firm across two stints. He first joined Accenture’s technology consulting wing for four years in 2006 before crossing for a two-year with PwC in Melbourne and then returning to Accenture in 2012. He currently serves as Accenture’s DevOps practice leader for A/NZ with a focus on business transformations.

Helen Nicholas has been with Accenture between Australia and the UK since 2007 in a variety of roles including her present position as relationship marketing managing director for APAC Africa the Middle East and Latin America based out of Sydney. While in London where she spent upwards of six years she also served as global digital marketing lead for Accenture’s energy industry business among other roles.

Chris Venus becomes a managing director with Accenture Strategy in Melbourne after first joining the firm as a consultant from Deloitte in early 2014 having spent four years at the Big Four firm (during which time he became a qualified chartered accountant). Venus primarily focuses on the Retail and Consumer Goods sector along with cross-industry M&A. He holds an MBA from Melbourne Business School.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdmV4ZWMuY29tL3Nwb25zb3JzLzIwMjMvMDEvaW5zaWdodHMtcGxhdGZvcm1zLXNjYWxhYmxlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tZGF0YS1kcml2ZW4tZGVjaXNpb24vMzgxNDE1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insights Platforms: A scalable foundation for data-driven decision-making,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdmV4ZWMuY29tL3Nwb25zb3JzLzIwMjMvMDEvaW5zaWdodHMtcGxhdGZvcm1zLXNjYWxhYmxlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tZGF0YS1kcml2ZW4tZGVjaXNpb24vMzgxNDE1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2C71BA0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Scott Belsky

Scott Belsky is the founder of Behance and the chief product officer at Adobe.

He predicts that our healthcare will be increasingly AI-based.

Belsky also believes we'll be able to see daily or weekly ""super cuts"" of our lives.

Every year I ask myself ""How will work and life change in a material way over the next three to five years?""

As a founder myself (Behance) Adobe's Chief Product Officer and an early investor in over 80 startups — these trends inform my work and are a fun annual exercise.

2022 was a pivotal year for:

Collaborative web apps disrupting every function of the enterprise. Artificial intelligence reaching key milestones. Market shifts resetting companies and more.

Now what are the forecasts and implications for the years ahead?

1. Internet browsers will shift from generalized to specialized

As web apps communal browsing and decentralized technology continue to grow browsers have become too generalized and antiquated for the future of web apps.

This new age of web apps will increase collaboration help create more productive workflows and will tap into the power of the cloud for AI features and heavy computation. Web apps offer virality and infinite possibilities for product-led growth and are finally powerful enough for sophisticated apps like Photoshop. But the full potential of these apps is constrained by the browser a general purpose and increasingly outdated piece of software.

Thus a new generation of specialized browsers will emerge.

Browsers will be reimagined for collaboration and higher performance web apps — like Arc from The Browser Company. Some browsers like one being developed by Triangle Labs will specialize in decentralized applications with less friction and far more security and confidence. As the ultimate interface on top of the web browsers will begin to compete with the apps themselves. And the growing ecosystem of third-party plug-ins will compete directly with the next generation of these purpose-built browsers.

2. Generative AI will have unexpected implications for content marketing education and the war to control the interface

AI will commoditize decades of content marketing and SEO tactics and usher in a new era of brand and influencer marketing.

Content marketing:

With models like ChatGPT driving the cost and time required to write effective SEO content down to zero every brand will ""flood the zone"" of search engines completely commoditizing content marketing.

Education:







ChatGPT has done to writing what the calculator did to arithmetic. You can now ask AI to write an essay on dinosaurs in the style of a 6th grader… or a 9th grader. After a few seconds you'll get an entirely original output every time.

Education curriculum's should focus on things humans must do as opposed to things computers can now do for us. While most writing — from content marketing to product specs — will be assisted by AI going forward crafting presentations and oral rhetoric using counterintuitive arguments and creativity will be skills that bring a premium. Education curriculums must adjust accordingly. Math should be taught in Excel or Airtable and writing should be taught alongside the art of prompt engineering.

The war for interface:

Leading knowledge and workflow management products will pivot to launch their own interface for queries.

In just the last few months some of the internet's greatest repositories of content like Quora Notion GitHub Stack Overflow and other legendary sources of user-generated content have announced their own AI-powered chat experiences.

This all leads to the uncomfortable realization that in the age of AI if you don't own the query interface you're just assembling training data for those who do. We know ""interface layers"" commoditize the technology underneath but I didn't realize interface layers would also commoditize content. Today AI is the ultimate interface layer as it not only disrupts underlying services data and content but also synthesizes and presents it all in transformative ways.

AI-powered in-product assistants will make a major comeback (Microsoft's infamous ""Clippy"" was just ahead of its time!). Q&A interfaces on top of AI are the biggest threat to Google and other information sources that monetize via traffic.

3. A highly personalized AI-powered medical assistant will complement (and eventually replace) our General Practitioner

If you ask ChatGPT about a medical condition you get a comprehensive often bullet-pointed answer that rivals anything you could construct from dozens of Google searches.

Now imagine if a more health-specific AI model were personalized for you with a private database of every health result every trend from your Whoop band or Apple Watch your family health history and every ailment you've ever had. Conversing with such a deeply informed resource would be 10 times better than our first line of defense today (Google) and could connect dots far better than we do on our own.

I anticipate that the first line of healthcare will increasingly be AI-based and we'll start seeing this in the next 24 months.

4. Social media will evolve to offer ""supercuts"" of our lives

Much like Netflix we'll tune in to see the supercut of our lives presented as short and highly engaging AI-edited daily or weekly episodes. The vanity metric and competitive component of this new era of social apps will simply be your contributions ""making the cut"" among all of the stuff you and your friends record throughout the day.

The AI editor/curator will decide what everyone in your group will find interesting (measured by previous allocations of attention) to determine what content makes the final cut. One team exploring this space is Studio a ""group camcorder"" taking off amongst teenagers. More generally across the next generation of social apps the traditional social graph will continue to become less relevant as TikTok-like AI-powered algorithmic feeds determine what we see based on what we like. However I am on the lookout for hybrid solutions that leverage both social graphs alongside AI-powered editing and curation.

5. New tools and AI capabilities will make us all more expressive and creatively confident

We are more creatively confident in kindergarten than we are as adults. Our confidence deteriorates as we become discouraged by comparing ourselves to others and the difficulty of learning how to use creative tools.

But now free web-based tools with templates have helped us conquer the fear of the blank screen. Plus powerful generative artificial intelligence enables anyone to express themselves creatively without a notoriously steep learning curve.

As a result the value of creative work will shift from outcomes to process and ingenuity. The original idea the judgment the innovations in process and the story become more important than ever.

Compensation models will shift from time-based to value-based. Do creative people get paid for their judgment and ideas or their time? Historically time has been the easiest measure of work and the most popular factor for charging for work completed. But in an era in which much of our mundane and repetitive work is accomplished by AI-powered assistants the time required for creative work has materially reduced.

So how do creators start charging for value added as opposed to time spent? Perhaps there will be some mutually agreed upon pricing model that takes experience into account? Perhaps more creative teams will get compensated based on the performance of their work?

One of the most exciting and under-discussed opportunities is new compensation models for creators to monetize the use of their style or likeness to generate original art or music. Compensation is ripe for re-imagination in the era of AI.

6. Content creators will own their audience and some will become ""platform-less""

Content creators with mass audiences are seeking novel ways to own the relationship.

Remarkable minds like Sahil Bloom who shares curiosity and lessons learned in viral social threads or Becky Kennedy who (alongside my wife Erica) created Good Inside as an indispensable resource for parenting with over 1.6 million followers on Instagram are increasingly unwilling to rely on a single platform. I have watched Sahil build a fast-growing Substack that has become a business in itself. And the Good Inside founders have launched a subscription-based community that is off to a wildly successful start. In both cases these subscriptions go way beyond lead generation; they are alternatives (or complements) to books and social profiles.

As social platforms get insecure about losing their creator's content they will respond in ways that spawn the era of ""platform-less creators.""

We've seen Twitter's short-lived policy outlawing links to competing platforms but they will surely continue to down rank tweets with outbound links. These behaviors to keep people onsite are anti-Creator.

My friend Li Jin wrote a great playbook for this new world in which creators can leverage new tech to own their audiences. Ultimately I believe all creators-turned-businesses will own their audiences through newsletters and personalized subscription-based communities.

Flawed censorship and moderation policies will cause operators of social platforms to act more as stewards than owners.

Social platforms have been struggling more lately with the lines of censorship policy and active policing of content. The problem here is that the management teams of these social platforms are acting as owners (decide right and wrong) vs. stewards (we are here to serve the community we will engage you in decisions seek not to pass judgment and strive for transparency whenever possible).

One lesson learned building Behance to a community of 35 miilion highly opinionated creative people: you don't own a network you are the steward of a network.

7. We won't be able to trust our senses thanks to AI advancements

Some of you may have seen this uncanny deep fake of Morgan Freeman circling the internet. Clearly we can no longer rely on our senses to determine truth.

If you've been playing with any of the latest AI-powered video and editing features you've likely realized: we're entering an age where we can no longer believe our eyes. The same tools that speed up workflows and empower creative professionals to create wondrous media are becoming easier to use and more powerful. We're just years away from anyone being able to render a conversation with the unmistakable voice and likeness of somebody else without their permission. Our human senses and judgment will be hackable by anyone.

""Verify then trust"" is the new ""trust but verify.""

It's an era of both wondrous creativity and new genres of risk. We must be imaginative not just about what can go right but also about what can go wrong. Humans must develop new instincts to verify before we trust and become less prone to manipulation. We must usher in an era of attribution where content shows WHO made it and HOW it was made (and unsigned content is assumed to be fake or AI-made). When humans see anonymous content without any verifiable ""content credentials"" about its origins (from open source efforts like the Content Authenticity Initiative) we must stop believing it by default.

At Adobe we are full steam ahead embracing this open source solution to enable creators to add content credentials but we need more engagement from both the content creation and social platforms of the world.

8. Hyper-personalized experiences will enable an immersive era that is tailored to you.

As people gain creative confidence culture will change as fashion and life design (your furniture wallpaper etc.) becomes hyper-personalized.

Today the designs in your life are created by small teams and generalized for the masses. The clothes you wear the media you consume the digital dashboard in your car the items in your home — they are all made by a few and generalized for as many as possible. But with widespread creative confidence will come a desire to culturally flex yourself through personalization. I anticipate a world in which you customize your shoes or clothing before checking out.

I anticipate that our experiences in cars will be personalized by us using templates for the dashboard design and customization kits for interiors. And when we start wearing AR glasses around every person's world will look remarkably different by design just because we can!

And new technology will emerge that enables user personalization without compromising user privacy. Yes sounds like a total contradiction but I am aware of one early-stage team assembling around this opportunity without creative solutions the great ""opt out"" of data.

9. Companies will perform rapid resets to focus economize and build resiliency

Current market conditions shift companies from the ""carbs era"" to the ""muscle era"" of building great organizations. Coming off a decade of excess in which the easiest way to acquire customers and scale organizations was to throw more money and people at the problem the world is left with countless bloated organizations redundant teams and extraneous processes. But today's economic woes are a much-needed forcing function. We're entering the ""muscle era"" where we must solve problems by changing how we work and building a more resilient and capable team. Resourcefulness outperforms resources.

We can look at Twitter as a case-study for rapid resets.

What happens when you remove multiple levels of managers and bring everyone doing the work closer together? Do you regain the agility of startups? Do you instantly shed years of ""organizational debt"" that restrains a product's potential? I suspect we'll see more bold resets of companies around the world reimagined for a world in which most functions can be automated.

The industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% until 2027. Therefore quality stocks Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) are expected to gain significantly.

AMD has lost 16.6% over the past month while TSM has lost 10.2%. AMD has gained 2.2% over the past three months while TSM has gained 8.7%. But which of these stocks is the better pick now? Let’s find out.

Latest Developments

On December 1 2022 AMD and Viettel High Tech (Member of Viettel Group) announced the successful completion of a 5G mobile network field trial deployment. This collaboration for advanced 5G connection deployment is expected to be strategically beneficial for both companies.

On the other hand on October 26 2022 TSM announced the Open Innovation Platform® (OIP) 3DFabric Alliance at the 2022 Open Innovation Platform Ecosystem Forum.

Dr. L.C. Lu TSM’s fellow and vice president of design and technology platform said “Through the collective leadership of TSMC and our ecosystem partners our 3DFabric Alliance offers customers an easy and flexible way to unlocking the power of 3D IC in their designs and we can’t wait to see the innovations they can create with our 3DFabric technologies.”

Recent Financial Results

AMD’s net revenue came in at $5.57 billion for the third quarter that ended September 24 2022 up 29% year-over-year. However its operating loss came in at $64 million compared to an income of $948 million in the year-ago period.

Moreover its net income came in at $66 million down 92.8% year-over-year while its EPS came in at $0.04 down 94.7% year-over-year.

TSM’s net revenue came in at $20.23 billion for the third quarter that ended September 30 2022 up 47.9% year-over-year. Its comprehensive income came in at $10.33 billion up 101% year-over-year while its EPS came in at $1.79 up 79.8% year-over-year.

Past and Expected Financial Performance

AMD’s revenue is expected to increase 14.4% year-over-year to $5.52 billion for the yet-to-be-reported quarter ending December 2022. However its revenue is expected to decrease 5.6% year-over-year to $5.56 billion for the quarter ending March 2023.

Its EPS is expected to fall 27.2% year-over-year and 38.1% year-over-year to $0.67 and $0.70 for the quarters ending December 2022 and March 2023 respectively.

On the other hand TSM’s revenue is expected to increase 31.7% year-over-year to $74.82 billion in 2022 and 2.8% year-over-year to $76.94 billion in 2023. Its EPS is expected to increase 56.6% year-over-year to $6.45 in 2022.

Moreover its EPS is expected to rise 21.5% per annum for the next five years.

Profitability

TSM’s gross profit margin of 57.30% is higher than AMD’s 50.95%. Its EBITDA and net income margins of 68.04% and 42.51% are higher than AMD’s 24.30% and 9.96% respectively.

In addition TSM’s ROE ROA and ROTC of 36.57% 19.92% and 19.33% are higher than AMD’s 7.37% 2.26% and 5.72% respectively.

Thus TSM is more profitable.

Valuation

In terms of forward EV/Sales AMD’s 4.32x is 10.9% lower than TSM’s 4.85x. However its forward EV/EBITDA of 12.87x is higher than TSM’s 7.01x while its forward P/E of 49.62x compares with TSM’s 11.71x.

POWR Ratings

TSM’s overall B rating equates to Buy in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. On the other hand AMD has an overall rating of D which translates to Sell. The POWR Ratings are calculated considering 118 different factors with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.

TSM has a B grade for Growth consistent with its steady financials in the latest reported quarter. In comparison AMD has a D grade for Growth consistent with its bleak financials.

In addition TSM has an A grade for Quality. Its trailing-12-month CAPEX/Sales of 47.26% is substantially higher than the industry average of 2.50%.

In contrast AMD has a D grade for Quality. Its trailing-12-month CAPEX/Sales of 1.80% is 27.8% lower than the industry average.

Of the 92-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry TSM is ranked #12 and AMD is ranked #89.

These days when you ask someone to name an advertising mascot they're likely to come up with one from an insurance commercial: Flo from Progressive LiMu Emu the AFLAC duck or that cute little Geico gecko. Back in the 20th century however advertisers were all about food mascots. Quite a few of those mascots are still with us and in fact many of them have been rebooted for the modern era: Tony the Tiger is now a Twitch streamer while Toucan Sam got all glammed up several years ago. Other mascots however were quietly retired or in one notorious case not-so-quietly killed off. While some of these missing mascots still have their fans others have long faded from our memory. (Anyone remember Mr. Ripe Guy the avocado? Didn't think so.)



If we had the power to bring back any of these pensioned-off spokescharacters though which ones would we pick? Mashed polled 582 readers and offered a choice of five: the Burger King Kids Club Gang the California Raisins Grimace Mr. Peanut and Twinkie the Kid. Which one of these mascots came out on top?

New work from UC researchers adds further and more in-depth evidence with data from both in-home real life cleaning scenarios as well as laboratory tests. Switching to green cleaning products significantly reduced emissions of toxic chemicals but some cause for concern remains.

A group of University of California researchers including those associated with UC Berkeley’s Center for Environmental Research and Children’s Health (CERCH) measured air concentrations of potentially hazardous volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs respectively) released from both traditional and green cleaning products in both in-home settings and a controlled laboratory setting. The study was led by author Lucia Calderon a former graduate student researcher at CERCH and a current project coordinator for community-engaged research at UCSF. The study focused on “chemicals that might increase women’s risk of breast cancer including possible carcinogens reproductive/developmental toxicants or endocrine disruptors.”

The study—part of the Lifting Up Communities by Intervening with Research (LUCIR) Study (principal investigator: Dr. Kim Harley associate adjunct professor of Maternal Child and Adolescent Health at Berkeley Public Health)—found a correlation between the use of both conventional and “green” cleaning products and higher concentrations of VOCs emitted into the air. Seventy-five percent of the highest VOC emissions were emitted by conventional cleaning products but researchers also identified some VOC emissions of concern from green products.

“Many people assume that cleaning more often and with stronger products (and often stronger smelling products) results in a healthier home” said James Nolan study co-author formerly a CERCH community science manager and currently a community engagement program manager at UCSF’s Western States Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit. “However household cleaning products contain chemicals of significant concern that could potentially have negative impacts on their health in the long term.”

Further when health-conscious consumers purchase “green” cleaning products they may expect them to be free of harmful chemicals. However there is no official regulatory standard for what “green” means— or governmental process to enforce it—so consumers may be exposed to some chemicals of concern even while using products labeled as “green” or “natural.”

As women are the primary cleaners in the home environment and Latina women make up the vast majority of professional house cleaners in California the research team was concerned with increased risk of breast cancer and other reproductive harm as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals.

“Exposure may contribute to larger health inequities” Nolan said. “Impacts may be even greater for those who are pregnant or those with young children.” The team suggested precautions such as using products certified as the EPA’s Safer Choice products ensuring proper ventilation while cleaning and using personal protective equipment.

The team found that air concentrations of certain VOCs and SVOCs like chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were higher in the breathing zones of participants while they conducted their normal cleaning routines using conventional cleaning products in their homes. These levels decreased significantly when participants later switched to using only “green” cleaning products.

“Overall ‘green’ or ‘natural’ products emitted significantly less chemicals of concern” Nolan said. But the researchers did see elevated levels of some chemicals specifically fragrance chemicals associated with use of some “green” cleaning products.

Spanning almost a decade previous papers from several members of the team at CERCH have focused on Latina teen’s exposures to pesticides and on Latina teen’s exposures to potentially carcinogenic chemicals in personal care products among other environmental exposures of concern.

The LUCIR Study has been led by Dr. Kim Harley an associate adjunct professor for maternal child and adolescent health at Berkeley Public Health. Previous papers from LUCIR focused on Latina teen’s exposures to pesticides and on potentially carcinogenic chemicals in personal care products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy8wMS8wMi8yNTgxNzM2LzAvZW4vSW5vcmdhbmljLUNoZW1pY2FsLVBhY2thZ2luZy1NYXJrZXQtd2lsbC1zdXJwYXNzLVVTRC0zLTgzLWJpbGxpb24tYnktMjAzMC1HcmV5Vmlld3MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inorganic Chemical Packaging Market will surpass USD 3.83 billion by 2030 : GreyViews,"Pune India Jan. 02 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The market has been studied for the below mentioned-segmentation and regional analysis for North America Europe Asia South America and Middle East and Africa.

It also begs the question: Why does that intense level of public discussion suddenly vanish when it comes to refining the antiquated methods that corporations use to account for their greenhouse gas emissions reductions?

Seriously. It’s a poorly kept secret that most GHG footprint declarations we all read in corporate social responsibility (CSR) environmental or sustainability reports are a complex mashup of calculations based on procurement information estimates reported by corporate divisions and supply chain partners and averages that have been worked up for various industry sectors.

And when it comes to Scope 3 data the guesstimating about a product’s carbon life cycle is even more complicated according to industry experts.

""It’s not that crazy of an idea. Think about it: Companies would never ever do their normal accounting their financial accounting off the back of industry averages"" observed Anna Stanley-Radière director of climate transparency at the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) during a session last month at VERGE Net Zero 22. ""Companies are using secondary data industry averages proxy data to account for their emissions to then take targeted reduction measures. Yes it’s really important that progress is made and we definitely need to see this as a journey where bit by bit companies get better. But we need to quickly get to that primary data in order to be able to completely understand where those hotspots are and where we can take much more targeted action.""

Maria Carolina Fujihara CEO and founder of carbon accounting software firm Sinai Technologies highlighted the challenges of using non-primary data during a VERGE Net Zero keynote talk. ""These estimates can be misleading because they often use the most conservative scenarios for emissions intensities. Additionally data is not updated regularly"" Fujihara said. Sinai’s software enables large companies to ""measure analyze price and reduce emissions."" The company’s customers include ArcelorMittal Bayer Nature and Siemens.

During her presentation Fujihara shared the results of Sinai’s recent experiment to collect and calculate the emissions of chicken nuggets rather than using generic databases. ""The main assumption was if we were able to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions from all the companies in the chicken nugget value chain we could calculate the entire emissions impact of manufacturing the product without having to rely on [life-cycle assessments or LCAs] or Scope 3 estimates. Because at the end Scope 3 is always someone else’s Scope 1 and 2.""

The CFO who signs off on this data is going to want to know that it is auditable.

Sinai worked with five major agriculture and food producers to create ""granular"" inventories for more than 2000 tons of chicken nuggets in 2021. The pilot considered emissions related to grain production seed production and the hatcheries but didn’t examine fertilize production or some logistical considerations (which will be evaluated in the next phase). Sinai then compared the primary data with the broadly available estimates and discovered a large discrepancy. ""Because LCA data is based on broad estimates we suspected that the numbers might be off target compared to first-party data and we were correct"" Fujihara said.

An expanding palette of carbon accounting software tools

This disconnect is one of the motivations for the substantial amount of money invested last year in software companies seeking to digitize carbon accounting including Sinai Watershed (a partner of GreenBiz) Greenly Persefoni and Sustain.Life. Shortly before the year-end holiday energy data platform company Arcadia scored $125 million more in funding — bringing its total infusion in 2022 alone to $325 million.

The company’s product Arc allows corporations to aggregate utility data across multiple locations (it covers more than 50 countries) providing a more accurate view of electricity consumption and carbon intensity on a far more frequent basis. Arcadia says it has more than 300 customers including EnelX Ford Oracle and Salesforce which is also its partner. It also provides utility data for the Salesforce Net Zero Cloud management platform.

Arcadia is used by its customers to plan energy efficiency projects and guide renewable energy procurement among other things according to founder and CEO Kiran Bhatraju. He says access to primary data will be non-negotiable as carbon accounting becomes a C-suite executive concern. ""The CFO who signs off on this data is going to want to know that it is auditable"" Bhatraju said.

Practitioners advocate reset on GHG accounting

An upcoming revision being considered for the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) the de facto standard that many corporations use for measuring and managing emissions also promises to change the rules of carbon footprint accounting.

The protocol managed by WBCSD and the World Resources Institute (WRI) is a foundational part of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) — but it hasn’t been revised significantly in more than a dozen years. In recent months corporate sustainability professionals have been pushing for an overhaul for many reasons including the mandatory reporting requirements proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Also being considered is a major overhaul of how renewable energy certificates (RECs) are counted toward Scope 2 calculations — if they should be counted at all — as well as new guidance for tabulating Scope 3 impacts according to the GHG Protocol website.

This article offers a comprehensive rundown of what’s at stake. WRI and WBCSD are accepting stakeholder feedback on proposed changes to the GHG Protocol until Feb. 28.

Those potential changes can’t come quickly enough for the corporate practitioners who came together in early December to create a new initiative the Emissions First partnership that recognizes ""the way in which organizations account for carbon emissions from electricity use should incentivize actions that maximize carbon reductions.""

The group has published a set of principles they’re hoping to see embraced within the forthcoming amendments to GHG accounting. Their ideas support a primary objective of moving away from calculations that emphasize matching megawatt-hour for renewable energy contracts and that instead prioritize corporation action that actually decarbonizes the grid including energy efficiency projects or the addition of clean power in regions where it isn’t plentiful.

Among the signatories are Akamai Technologies Amazon General Motors Hannon Armstrong Heineken Intel Meta Rivian Salesforce and Workday. ""The GHG Protocol should allow for innovation growth and easy adoption that can be grounded against a guideline that sets a minimum bar"" said Mike Mattera director of corporate sustainability and ESG officer at Akamai in a statement. ""The original guidance has done a great job of getting us all moving in the right direction. We now have an opportunity to build on that critical baseline to continue to innovate for the future.""

Holly Lahd energy strategy manager with Meta said the group seeks to send a signal to carbon accounting standards setters and disclosure bodies — including SBTi and CDP — that the rules need to better reflect meaningful investments that result in actual emissions reductions with a given company’s value chain. ""This is the first flag-planting not the end of the conversation"" she told me.

[Continue the dialogue on latest sustainable business trends at GreenBiz 23 — the premier annual event for sustainable business leaders.]

Among the sorts of projects that should be considered for contribution are activities that don’t necessarily count under the current rules including energy storage installations or software for better load management Lahd said. At the same time she noted practitioners also need more clarity about the future of corporate clean power procurement and how existing contracts will be counted moving forward something addressed in Principle No. 7 advocated by the group. That suggestion urges that accounting frameworks ""avoid penalizing"" investments that were made under the existing guidance while moving toward more rigorous metrics for new projects.

""Practically speaking with the GHG accounting dialogue and industry there are some proponents who recommend we should no longer be able to use renewable energy procurement to meet their emissions goals"" Lahd said. ""Others are arguing you should have to map the renewable energy and your electricity consumption in a very small geography. … These are proposals details matter but they potentially have the impact to really eliminate or significantly devalue investments companies have previously made under the current framework and we think that would be detrimental to the market and create … investment uncertainty moving forward.""

The Scope 3 data dilemma

One of the biggest motivators for the rise of better carbon footprint accounting tools is the need for more granular reporting around Scope 3 emissions in large part because many companies have very little direct line of sight into those impacts.

""Across the board we have challenges on things like traceability on measurement monitoring reporting and verification and how to make sure we have partners that are really bought into the same journey as us and that we are incentivizing change with"" observed Autumn Fox climate sustainability senior manager with Mars while discussing her company’s Scope 3 initiatives during VERGE Net Zero.

Indeed Accenture recently estimated that almost two-thirds of the upstream Scope 3 emissions in corporate supply chains come from suppliers that organizations aren’t dealing with directly. ""Scope 3 emissions are elusive and difficult to track in today’s complex supply chains. Many large companies don’t even know the suppliers beyond Tier 1 let alone have any sort of influence or control over them or their sustainability practices which is why we have seen little progress in reductions to date"" said Kris Timmermans supply chain lead with Accenture in a statement.

""Buyers typically have some internal system where they independently try to reach out to their thousands of suppliers and collect data in what is likely an unstandardized format yielding data that is incomplete and incomparable"" said Nicole Labutong principal for climate intelligence and supply chains at RMI during a discussion at VERGE Net Zero.

Companies need to be able to have the same data points flying through the system so that they can understand the data … and actually do something with the data.

Little surprise then that alongside the GHG Protocol update a growing number of initiatives are dedicated to defining best practices for implementing emissions interventions and reductions across corporate value chains. Here are four efforts discussed during VERGE Net Zero that are likely to inform carbon footprint accounting in the future:

Value Change Initiative – Created by Gold Standard and SustainCERT the program launched with 60 organizations from large corporations civil society (such as WRI and SBTi) and ""technical experts."" The intent is to establish best practices for how to recognize impacts and it includes corporations such as Adidas Amazon Barry Callebaut Bayer Danone General Mills Mars Nike Patagonia PepsiCo and VF Corp. The initial work has centered on food and beverage companies but working groups representing the fashion/apparel and transport sectors are starting up. The initiative is ""creating guidance documents that are essentially suggestions of how mass balance accounting in Scope 3 could work"" said Thomas Blackburn head of business development for SustainCERT during a presentation.

Verified Carbon Standard – Verra released updates to its widely used GHG crediting program in December covering a number of areas including requirements intended to ""help avoid double claiming of emissions reductions and removals in Scope 3 emissions inventories."" Candace Vinke senior director of nature-based innovation at Verra said the objectives are twofold. ""We want to create a certification pathway for supply chain interventions and second we want to give companies the certainty and flexibility they need to encourage the investment that we really must see to meet Scope 3 emissions targets."" Among other things Verra intends to create a long-term monitoring system that will monitor land use projects using remote sensing providing more confidence around claims.

Horizon Zero – This initiative spearheaded by RMI leans heavily on technology — including emissions-tracking services such as Climate Trace which relies on satellites other data sources and artificial intelligence to improve visibility into emissions data for specific facilities. It is also advocating the reporting standards harmonization work of the Coalition on Materials Emissions Transparency (COMET) and hinges on digital ledger technologies (a.k.a. blockchain) that secure and track information as well as ""digital twins"" that act as data proxies for their real-life siblings such as factories or products. The idea is to create a way for different systems to ""talk to"" each other. The effort is aligned with work by the GHG Protocol and methodologies are available for five hard-to-abate sectors with more to come this year according to Labutong.

The effort is aligned with work by the GHG Protocol and methodologies are available for five hard-to-abate sectors with more to come this year according to Labutong. Partnership for Carbon Transparency (PACT) — Hosted by the WBCSD this effort is also focused on improving emissions data exchanges along entire value chains down to the product level. ""The product-level lens is so essential because if you really want to decarbonize your value chain you have to understand where that carbon sits and if you’re looking at it at a corporate level you’re not going to be able to get sufficient granularity to take targeted action” said WBCSD’s Stanley-Radière. This will take ""radical collaboration"" at the sector level to surface primary data that is verified she added.

As big buyers become more focused on mitigating their climate risks the push to make these and other initiatives real will intensify. One need look no further than the procurement aspirations of the U.S. government — which is pushing for net-zero status at federal agencies by 2050. The proposed rule (open for comment until Jan. 13) seeks to require companies with at least $50 million in federal contracts to disclose relevant emissions across Scope 1 2 and 3.

In particular there’s a need to ensure that the sorts of data points being shared at the product level are standardized so procurement teams have a better sense of how to compare potential suppliers. Stanley-Radière said: ""Companies need to be able to have the same data points flying through the system so that they can understand the data … and actually do something with the data … We’re not going to get to perfect data but at the same time if we’re sharing different sorts of data in different formats in Excel sheets the system doesn’t make sense and you’re not able to understand and piece together the puzzle … in order to be able to intervene.""

Realistically speaking it will be months if not years before primary data collection becomes a given. So what can companies do to prepare for more practical and verifiable carbon emissions accounting methods CFOs and corporate auditors will be excited to embrace?

Labutong offers this recommendation: ""If you want to focus on which vendors to work with or service providers or just how to divide your time I would look to those that are the most influential the most aligned with your current strategy and [that] your company has the most ability to move where you can have open lines of communication to get data and then build from there.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Tuesday he was sworn in as the new Marathon County sheriff.

Billeb who grew up in Brookfi eld near Milwaukee moved to Medford when he was a junior in high school. At that point he didn’t know what path he would be taking after finishing school. It wasn’t until he got a chance to interact with the Taylor County Sheriff’s Office that he realized his calling.

“I had no interest in law enforcement but on that first ride-along we got into a high speed chase and I think we arrested a drunk driver” Billeb recalled. “I came home and I remember telling my parents ‘I know what I want to do.’” At age 18 Billeb joined the police academy and soon after began his decades- long career. Over the years he worked for the Rib Lake Police Department the Price County Sheriff’s Office and the Medford Police Department before landing his first full-time job with the Colby-Abbotsford Police Department. After four and a half years went by Billeb made the decision to pursue a county position.

“You kind of find your niche where you think you would best fit” Billeb said. “For me it was county law enforcement. It’s different. The types of calls are different. Our interactions are different.”

Billeb spent several years as a patrol deputy for the Marathon County Sheriff’s Department before transferring to the special investigations unit where he worked in the narcotics division for about three years. Following that he was promoted to lieutenant and began supervising court security. It was then he realized he missed patrol duty.

“I really missed the interactions out on the street” Billeb said. “So I asked to be transferred back to the road and everyone thought I was nuts because I left a Monday through Friday job to go back to working swing shifts and a lot of uncertainty.”

Although his transfer was approved the sheriff at that time asked Billeb to also keep his court security duties because he had made good relationships with the judges. While working both jobs an opening for a division commander position cropped up which Billeb was offered. During that time he oversaw the administrative division taking charge of things like budgets policy and public records. It was only a couple years later when he was approached by his predecessor Scott Parks who asked him to serve as chief deputy.

For almost 10 years Billeb worked as the second in command to Parks who retired officially on Sunday. It was Parks who asked Billeb if he wanted to seek the head leadership role when he decided not to run for office again.

“I went home and had a conversa-tion with my wife and my two girls and decided that running for sheriff was something we could do together as a family” Billeb who ran unopposed in November said.

The new sheriff said he’s focused on what he sees as some of the biggest issues facing the county — mental health and substance abuse.

According to Billeb changes at North Central Health Care a mental health clinic in Wausau makes it “a perfect time for us to come together and start approaching [these issues] again with maybe a new view a new approach and move that forward.” He also said the offi ce is trying to start creative programs within the county jail to address those issues.

“So much of what happens in this county is a product of mental health and substance abuse” Billeb said.

Another focus for Billeb will be “staying ahead of the technology.” He recalled buying a bag phone with an antenna that had to be put on the top of his squad car during his earlier years on the job. Nowadays new deputies are issued a cell phone and computer immediately to be able to communicate in various ways. Billeb used the department’s forensic lab as another example of how technology has drastically changed.

“We have one of the premier labs in the state if not in this region of the country where we’re leaned on regularly to help with investigations” Billeb said.

Looking ahead Billeb said he’s aware he has “big shoes to fill.” He commended Parks who he described as “one of the best sheriffs this county has ever seen” along with various other officers he’s worked with over the years for preparing him for this role.

“The relationships and partnerships we have are really what makes us as an organization successful” Billeb said. “I feel very fortunate to have that.”

Elderon robbery shooting

Billeb’s tenure got off to a busy start when he assumed the sheriff duties this week. Before his swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday he briefed the media about an armed robbery home invasion that occurred in Elderon around 2:30 a.m. that morning. Deputies arrived on scene after a report of a 79-year-old man being assaulted and stabbed as he exited his vehicle in his garage.

According to a press release from the sheriff’s office the homeowner was in possession of a firearm and fired one round that struck the suspect in the chest prior to the firearm being wrestled away from him.

The suspect died while fleeing the scene; Billeb told reporters the deceased suspect was found in a vehicle nearby and both weapons were recovered. The homeowner sustained nonlife threatening injuries and was recovering at a local hospital on Tuesday.

According to the release investigators believe the suspect followed the man home from a local establishment and there is no further threat to the community. They had not yet released the suspect’s name pending family notifi cation.",,,,,,

Fresh after winning the Allstate Sugar Bowl with the Crimson Tide the 21-year-old can focus on his NIL deals until Alabama's next opponent is revealed.

The Name Image and Likeness deals have become a huge talking point in college football over the last year or so. Many young students have already signed several deals to promote themselves and their bank accounts thank them for it.

Young is no different. Well perhaps he is a little. Given that he is a quarterback and the face of Nick Saban's team and a highly touted NFL Draft prospect the NIL deals we imagine will be coming thick and fast.

Already a Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young has again backed that up in 2022 albeit with less numbers than in 2021. Young has thrown for 3328 passing yards 32 touchdowns and just five interceptions in his 12 regular-season games.

With those kinds of numbers and we think declaring for the NFL draft Bryce Young will have no shortage of NIL deals to comb over during the offseason.

But how much money has he made from his NIL deals and endorsements already?

How much has Bryce Young made from his NIL deals?

Allstate Sugar Bowl - Alabama v Kansas State

The 21-year-old has already had his fair share of NIL deals throughout his college career. Now these are all reports as the actual number of his deals is up for debate.

But last offseason it was reported that Young already had an $800000 NIL deal in place. That's good money for a young player yet to make it to the NFL.

It doesn't stop there however. Bryce Young also signed a couple of new NIL deals throughout this season. The first was with Dollar Shave Club a company that sends shaving items like razors through the mail.

Expand Tweet

His second is with BMW and he got a car in return. That'll work too. He is also reported to have had deals with Onyx Fanatics Cash App per www.on3.com.

Young has a total NIL worth of around $3.5 million per on3.com which is incredible given he hasn't even signed with an NFL team yet.

A stock market sell-off in 2022 led shares in Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) and Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) to plunge between 40% and 50% since last January. Macroeconomic headwinds brought declines in the companies' respective industries dragging their stocks down.

However Amazon and Alphabet continue to have leading market shares in lucrative industries and have promising outlooks over the long term. Market declines have only made their stocks more attractive.

While both of these stocks are great picks to buy now and hold indefinitely one is currently the better buy. Let's find out which one.

Amazon

After stellar stock growth in 2020 and 2021 resulting from pandemic lockdowns that saw consumers overwhelmingly choose Amazon for their shopping needs reopenings in 2022 led the company's shares to plunge 50% year over year. Like many tech and e-commerce companies Amazon's stock and quarterly results in 2022 suffered from almost unfair comparisons to the previous year. However 2023 might be a path toward redemption.

In the third quarter of 2022 Amazon's e-commerce business suffered as its North America segment hit $78.8 billion in revenue rising 20% year over year and operating income came to a negative $412 million. Meanwhile foreign currency changes resulting in an unusually strong dollar led its international segment to report a 4.8% decrease in revenue and $2.4 billion in operating losses.

Amazon has responded to its losses throughout the last year with cost-cutting measures such as letting go of 10000 corporate employees closing or canceling dozens of warehouses and shutting down projects such as its healthcare start-up Amazon Care.

The company's e-commerce performance in 2023 will be contingent on the economic climate which a looming recession may bring down further. However this is where Amazon's diverse business comes in handy. The most attractive part of Amazon is its cloud computing service Amazon Web Services (AWS) which held a leading 34% market share as of Q3 2022.

The cloud platform earned 100% of Amazon's operating income in Q3 2022 with AWS reporting a revenue rise of 27% year over year to $20.5 billion and operating income of $5.4 billion. Cloud computing is a quickly growing industry worth $368.97 billion expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 15.7% through 2030.

It will take time for Amazon's e-commerce business to begin seeing profits again especially if a recession brings further declines. However its budget cuts and thriving cloud computing business could keep the company growing as temporary economic headwinds run their course. An investment in Amazon is no doubt a long-term one but it could pay off in the end.

Alphabet

Rising inflation and interest rates over the last year led many businesses to pare down budgets with advertising one of the first things to go. As a result a decline in digital ad spending in 2022 brought Alphabet shares down 39% over the last 12 months. However short-term market declines don't dampen the tech titan's positive outlook.

Although nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue comes from ads on platforms such as Google YouTube and Android the company continued to report revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2022 revenue increased 6% year over year to $69 billion with operating income hitting $17.1 billion.

Despite slight declines in YouTube ads and Google Network marginal growth for search advertising and services was between 2.4% and 4.2%. Meanwhile the quarter's brightest spot was the Google Cloud segment which increased 37.6% to $6.8 billion.

Recent market declines in digital advertising may be concerning but Alphabet's leading 28% market share is still incredibly promising for its long-term future. Research from Omdia estimates the digital advertising market was worth $190 billion in 2022 and will almost double to $362 billion by 2027. Alphabet is well-positioned to see significant gains from the market's growth.

Comparing Alphabet and Amazon more directly the Google parent's free cash flow stood at $62.5 billion as of Sept. 30 while Amazon reported a negative $26.32 billion. When comparing price-to-earnings ratios Amazon's sits at 77 while Alphabet's is at about 18 suggesting its current stock price offers considerably more value.

Amazon is a great stock to buy and hold for the very long term even as its short-term prospects feel slightly murky. However Alphabet is undeniably the better buy today. The digital advertising market may have suffered from poor macroeconomic conditions in 2022 but it's unlikely to be down for long.

In the past couple of months streaming giants like Netflix and Walt Disney have heartily embraced digital ads by introducing ad-supported tiers to their platforms. The potential for other companies to similarly use ads to reduce consumer fees is endless making Alphabet's stock a no-brainer buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2luZGlhL2dvb2dsZS1hbGxlZ2VzLWluZGlhLWFudGl0cnVzdC1ib2R5LWNvcGllZC1wYXJ0cy1ldS1vcmRlci1hbmRyb2lkLWFidXNlLTIwMjMtMDEtMDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google alleges India antitrust body copied parts of EU order on Android abuse,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/india/google-alleges-india-antitrust-body-copied-parts-eu-order-android-abuse-2023-01-03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2luZGlhL2dvb2dsZS1hbGxlZ2VzLWluZGlhLWFudGl0cnVzdC1ib2R5LWNvcGllZC1wYXJ0cy1ldS1vcmRlci1hbmRyb2lkLWFidXNlLTIwMjMtMDEtMDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2MyZGE2ZWIxLWJhODEtNDBjNS1hNDExLWRmYzk0ZWEyODBkYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google develops free terrorism moderation tool for smaller websites,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price do they really matter?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet (GOOGL).

Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell) calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy Hold Sell etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR 28 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.9% and 12.1% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying Alphabet but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank which classifies stocks into five groups ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5 they are two completely different measures.

Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank on the other hand is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers they mislead investors far more often than they guide.

In contrast the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions according to empirical research.

In addition the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough it is always timely in indicating future price movements.

Is GOOGL a Good Investment?

Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.68.

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alphabet.

The vans are shown here on AC overnight chargers.

Amazon’s electric delivery vans from Rivian continue to make their way to cities across the U.S. with drivers perhaps serving as some of their best PR agents.

The bluish gray vans – distinguished by their tall height round headlights and Amazon badging on the grille – began rolling out to the retail giant’s own drivers and those working for independently contracted Amazon Delivery Service Partners this past summer.

Since then more vans have continued to hit the streets bringing the holiday shopping season total to more than 1000 Amazon electric delivery vans (or EDVs as Amazon calls them) which have delivered packages in more than 100 cities across the country. Amazon is aiming to have 100000 EDVs from Rivian deployed by 2030.

While sustainability targets and ESG scores have tended to dominate story lines concerning EV acquisition at the fleet level it’s Amazon’s drivers in this case which are getting some attention given their ongoing praise for these high-tech zero-emission workhorses.

Amazon Rivian electric van interior Julieta Dennis an Amazon Delivery Service Partner and owner of Kangaroo Logistics in Palatine Illinois said the vans have been a hit with her drivers.

“We started making deliveries with the electric vehicles from Rivan in August and my team has had nothing but good things to say about the vans” Dennis said. “The safety features like the automatic emergency braking and 360-degree cameras are game changers and the drivers also love the overall comfort of the vehicle.”

Amazon driver Darin Watkins called his electric van a “showstopper” that he enjoys driving through neighborhoods.

“I love it. To me it's exciting” he said. “I've never driven an electric vehicle so seeing the electric van it's so different.”

It’s different on the inside too where Watkins enjoys the cabin door that automatically opens whenever he makes a delivery stop. He likes the van’s center console display which gives him quick access to features.

“It’s like a tablet. It has literally everything from where you program the music from where you can adjust the mirrors. It just has everything you need right here in this system. Everything” he said.

Amazon Delivery Service Partner Juan DeLeon is not only impressed with the additional room the van provides but is also excited about additional safety features.

“Safety is our number one priority when it comes to delivering packages” DeLeon said. “These vehicles have sensors all over so anytime they're getting close to a certain object the vehicle will stop. That alone is priceless.”

In addition to the van’s quiet performance drivers have been impressed with the van’s “smooth driving and great suspension and acceleration” said Amazon spokesperson Kate Scarpa. “They’ve also told us they enjoy our unique ‘auto-hold’ feature where when our EDVs come to a stop they automatically go in a static position without changing the gear.”

Amazon’s EDV has a 150-mile range which Scarpa said “is enough to cover any delivery route” and does not require drivers to stop and charge during their shift.

Amazon has both DC fast-chargers and slower AC chargers. Drivers typically plug the vans into an AC charger at the end of their shift for an overnight charge.

Collaboration wins the day

Mustafa Samiwala Amazon’s head of vehicle products and programs pointed out that it’s taken a lot of work including ongoing collaboration with van manufacturer Rivian to arrive at a high level of driver satisfaction.

“We started with the driver experience in mind” Samiwala said. “We knew what a day for one of our drivers looked like. We know how it starts; we know how they load; we know how they deliver packages; we know how they come back to station; and so we have a very accurate view of exactly who the customer for this van is.”

Amazon The journey from concept to current model took roughly three years.

“We tested it and through prototyping and continued feedback from drivers [and] engineers to make sure the vehicle's the right quality and ready to come out on the road” said Mark Cuyler Amazon’s director of vehicle engineering and design.

The lengthy collaboration between Amazon and Rivian focused so much on Amazon drivers that the two companies refer to the jointly designed vehicles as custom electric delivery vans.

“The Amazon custom electric delivery vans were built with Amazon drivers in mind” said Rivian spokesperson Kenya Friend-Daniel. “From the beginning of the project Rivian and Amazon have been focused on providing drivers the safest and most comfortable vehicle possible simplifying their daily activities and ensuring the EDV is approachable ad easy to drive.”

The 360-degree cameras and parking sensors have been two of the most popular safety features for drivers.

“It’s been exciting to hear that drivers have appreciated and enjoyed safety features like the 360-degree surround view cameras parking sensors and the integrated software solutions with Amazon’s last mile delivery app and driver comforts like the microclimate HVAC system that’s connected to the driver’s seat” Friend-Daniel said. “It is Rivian’s goal to encourage EV adoption and we hope to do that by showing other companies what is possible with the thoughtful implementation of technology and a focus on the needs of the driver and the fleet operator.""

EDV expansion at Amazon not only hinges on vehicle production but also a charging infrastructure build-out which will require more collaborative efforts.

“Charging infrastructure may be one of the longest lead time components of our decarbonization plan for last mile delivery vans” Scarpa said. “We’ve looked at the partnerships we might adopt to enable charging for our fleet with vehicle manufacturers with charging network operators and with utilities and energy companies.”

Collaborations do however have their limits – at least for the time being. When asked if Rivian plans on working with other fleets to deploy its EDVs Friend-Daniel said “Ultimately we want to do our part to help more companies electrify their fleets but right now our focus is on getting more Amazon custom electric delivery vans on the road and in neighborhoods across the country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYm9pc2VkZXYuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMS8wMS9pY3ltaS1hbWF6b24tdG91dGVkLWh1bmRyZWRzLW9mLW5ldy1qb2JzLWZvci1tZXJpZGlhbi13YXJlaG91c2UtaXQtbmV2ZXItb3BlbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon fails to open warehouse in Meridian ID,"ICYMI 2023

High Sky Flying reported “Yes you can easily get sucked into an operating engine and it can be fatal. When an engine operates the amount of air getting sucked through its intake can cause a low air pressure area in the surrounding areas and pull you towards it.

The worker was sucked into the Embraer 170’s engine about 3 p.m. Saturday at Montgomery Regional Airport where it had its parking brake set the National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement to Insider.

The flight from Dallas was operated by Envoy Air a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group.

The airport said the victim worked for Piedmont Airlines another American regional subsidiary but did not provide further details.

“We are saddened to hear about the tragic loss of a team member of the AA/Piedmont Airlines” the airport’s executive director Wade Davis said in a statement.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this difficult time” he added.

In a statement American Airlines said it was devastated by the incident.

“We are focused on ensuring that all involved have the support they need during this difficult time” the company said declining further comment during the ongoing investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration are conducting an investigation. WSFA

The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration are conducting the probe.

When a jet engine is operating the air getting sucked into the intake can cause a low air pressure area that can pull nearby people into the rotating blades.

When parked cones are placed near the engines to mark the boundaries of the hazard areas the exact sizes of which are provided in the plane’s operating manual according to High Sky Flying.

For example the hazard area for an Airbus A320 is 14 feet in front of and on the sides of the engine inlet according to the site.

It is rare for ground personnel to be sucked into engines because they are trained about the dangers and how to stand clear of them.

The dead ground worker has not been identified and details of the accident have not been released.

The NTSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2dyb3VuZC1zdGFmZi1vZi11cy1haXJsaW5lLWtpbGxlZC1hZnRlci1iZWluZy1zdWNrZWQtaW50by1wbGFuZXMtZW5naW5lLTU0OTA2MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ground staff of US airline killed after being sucked into plane's engine,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.wionews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /world/ground-staff-of-us-airline-killed-after-being-sucked-into-planes-engine-549062 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E875B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2dyb3VuZC1zdGFmZi1vZi11cy1haXJsaW5lLWtpbGxlZC1hZnRlci1iZWluZy1zdWNrZWQtaW50by1wbGFuZXMtZW5naW5lLTU0OTA2MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93b3JsZC93b3JrZXItZGllcy1zdWNrZWQtamV0LWVuZ2luZS1hbGFiYW1hLWFpcnBvcnQtODM1ODExMC_SAWNodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd29ybGQvd29ya2VyLWRpZXMtc3Vja2VkLWpldC1lbmdpbmUtYWxhYmFtYS1haXJwb3J0LTgzNTgxMTAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ground worker dies after being sucked into a jet engine at Alabama Airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93b3JsZC93b3JrZXItZGllcy1zdWNrZWQtamV0LWVuZ2luZS1hbGFiYW1hLWFpcnBvcnQtODM1ODExMC_SAWNodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd29ybGQvd29ya2VyLWRpZXMtc3Vja2VkLWpldC1lbmdpbmUtYWxhYmFtYS1haXJwb3J0LTgzNTgxMTAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E853C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) nearly 70% of the nation’s grid is more than 25 years old. The DOE says the U.S. needs to expand electricity transmission systems by 60% by 2030—and may need to triple current capacity by 2050—to accommodate the country’s growing renewable energy sector and meet increasing power demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and electric home heating.

On Nov. 18 the Biden administration through the DOE announced $13 billion in new financing opportunities for the expansion and modernization of the nation’s electric grid. Funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law the Grid Resilience Innovative Partnership program and the Transmission Facilitation Program together represent the largest single direct federal investment in critical transmission and distribution infrastructure ever.

“We are moving swiftly to deliver cleaner cheaper energy to every American community by building a modern and reliable electric grid” U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said in the funding announcement.

What’s Being Done by Utilities

To get a better feel for what’s needed—and what’s actually being done—I spoke to Mike Edmonds Chief Commercial Officer with S&C Electric a 113-year-old company with global headquarters in Chicago Illinois that specializes in the switching protection and control of electric power systems. Edmonds said a lot is already being done by power companies to enhance and harden grid operations.

“We’re definitely seeing two very strong trends from the utility industry right now” he said in his British accent although he noted he’s lived in the U.S. for more than two decades. “One is around undergrounding. The other involves so called lateral protection or the lateral side so as you move away from the substation toward the consumer.”

Edmonds suggested that if you went back 15 years or so the market for undergrounding pad-mounted gear was driven by housing starts but today it’s been reinvigorated to improve system reliability and resiliency. He said both new and retrofitted systems are incorporating more underground and pad-mounted equipment some replacing equipment that’s 40 years old or more.

Concerning lateral protection Edmonds provided a simple explanation of the concept using his own home as an example. “My personal house here in Texas has a transformer outside fed by a fuse that’s on the end of a so-called lateral or single-phase” he said. “When we think about that part of the grid where all those revolutionary things are coming to us such as EVs and rooftop solar they get connected at that lateral side. We’re seeing continued adoption of technology that can actually mitigate outages from temporary faults can rapidly rebuild the grid can keep the grid on through a storm—we’ve seen examples of that in Florida and other places. And if devices do trip out on a permanent fault they can quickly be put back in a very straightforward manner.”

What’s Being Done in the C&I Space

A large part of S&C’s business also comes from the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector. “We’ve seen a fairly substantial uptick in the need to provide switching and protection gear for data centers” Edmonds said. “So that seems to be a trend that’s strong and will continue to be strong.”

Like utilities C&I companies are faced with supply chain issues. S&C is of course part of that supply chain so Edmonds sees what companies are doing to overcome these constraints. “They’re ordering ahead and starting to get reservations in earlier” he said. Thus proper planning is more important than ever.

S&C has also seen an increase in purchases of equipment to support EV charging systems. “We’ve actually started to see on the medium-voltage side which for us that’s 4000 volts and upwards we’re starting to see direct purchases for our equipment to put in campuses of electric infrastructure to get ready for charging needs” Edmonds said. “Because obviously those charging needs are going to be fairly substantial.”

The growth in EVs presents significant challenges for the grid. “There’ll be an expectation from the manufacturers and buyers of electric transportation that you can simply plug your EV into the grid. So we’re going to have to make sure the grid is ready for that. Otherwise you’ll be pretty disappointed you bought your nice new GMC Sierra Denali EV truck got it delivered in 2024 and realize you can’t actually find a 325-kW DC charger.”

Areas Requiring More Attention

There’s a tremendous amount of work to be done. The North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) said in its 2022 State of Reliability report that there are 511099 transmission circuit miles of greater than 100 kV. There are literally millions of miles more of low-voltage power lines and distribution transformers in the U.S. grid and therein lies perhaps the biggest challenge to reliability and resiliency.

“I still feel that the distribution grid itself should have more attention than it’s getting” said Edmonds. “I was part of a working group on the West Coast for EVs and their impacts on reliability of the grid and everyone was talking about transmission which is right to talk about but I just asked the innocent question: Where does the EV connect to? Is it 132 kV? Is it 230 kV? No. It connects ultimately to medium voltage” Edmonds explained.

“So why that’s important is: to have a strong powerful resilient transmission grid there’s the other piece of this and we’ve got to continue to focus on really improving and revolutionizing the distribution grid” he said. “So I feel passionate that we’re still not quite talking enough about that.”

In the world of travel credit cards paying big annual fees can get you big perks. That's certainly true with The Platinum Card® from American Express the *amex gold* and the *Amex Green Card* travel credits issued each calendar year.

These Amex travel credits help offset the cost of annual fees – $150 for the Green Card (see rates & fees) $250 for the Gold card (see rates & fees) and $695 for the Platinum card (see rates & fees). It’s a big part of the reason why we urge readers not to write off credit cards just because of big annual fees. Do it right and you can come out ahead even with huge yearly costs on some of these cards.

As we say goodbye to 2022 and welcome 2023 it's also time to welcome a fresh set of Amex travel credits if you hold any (or all) of these Amex cards: Almost all of the money-saving credits on these cards re-up on a calendar year basis. That means you've likely got a new batch of credits to use.

Read on to learn more about these credits and how to take advantage of them.

Not familiar with the cards? Read our guide to help decide which one is right for you.

American Express Airline Credits

Each new calendar year American Express Platinum cardholders get a $200 airline fee credit to be used with a selected U.S. airline. The Gold Card's previous $100 airline fee credit has officially disappeared last year.

Unfortunately buying airfare outright generally won't trigger the credit. These credits are designed for incidental fees like checked baggage seat assignment fees itinerary change fees guest access at a lounge or other fees at U.S.-based airlines.

As the terms & conditions below point out you must enroll and select one qualifying airline each year to use your credit. With a new credit the time is now to log in and choose your airline – though Amex will typically automatically select whichever carrier you chose last year you can easily change it now. Your choices are as follows:

United Airlines

Hawaiian Airlines

Frontier Airlines

Spirit Airlines

American Airlines

JetBlue

Southwest Airlines

Delta Air Lines

Alaska Airlines

Whether you’re paying for baggage seat selections change fees or anything else only one of the airlines mentioned above will trigger these credits so be sure to log in to your Amex account and select which airline you want to designate. You’ll find this under the “Benefits” tab. And be sure to select your airline before making any charges you hope the credit will cover.

It's gotten trickier and trickier to use these credits over time. But there are some other creative ways to use these credits including:

Cover the taxes and fees on an award ticket

Use a Delta eCredit or Delta Pay with Miles first then put the remainder on your Platinum Card – so long as the final charge is under $250 your airline credit should kick in

Buying flights under $100 with Southwest has typically worked though your mileage may vary

Buy an airline lounge day pass or a guest pass to the Delta Sky Club

$200 Hotel Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

Platinum cardholders were dealt a blow in 2021 when Amex raised the annual fee to a whopping $695 a year (see rates & fees) using questionable new benefits like credits for entertainment services to justify that hike. But one new credit shines: The Amex Platinum Hotel Credit.

Every year Platinum cardholders get a $200 credit to use toward prepaid stays at Fine Hotels and Resorts and Hotel Collection properties through Amextravel.com. This credit is based on the calendar year – not when you opened your card – so you've got a new $200 credit at the ready.

All you need to do is log in at Amextravel.com search for a property pay with your Platinum Card and that $200 credit will kick in automatically – typically within a few days though sometimes it can take weeks or longer.

One tip: Focus on Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) to get the most bang for your buck. This is Amex’s collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks like free room upgrades when available free daily breakfast for two an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services noon check-in when available and guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout.

Plus Hotel Collection properties require a two-night stay to trigger the credit. With FHR a one-night stay will do.

Uber Cash on the Platinum Card (And Now the Gold Card!)

The American Express Platinum card might put some tighter strings on travel credits but they make up for it with up to another $200 reserved for trips with Uber or food orders from the Uber Eats platform.

This one’s a bit easier to spend by year’s end as it’s not given in a $200 lump sum. Instead you get up to $15 in free Uber rides (or Uber Eats food orders) each month – except one. In December you can get up to $35 in Uber credits for the final month of the year.

Make sure you’ve added your American Express Platinum Card to your Uber account as that’s the key to unlocking the monthly credit. It will apply automatically to your ride no matter whether you “pay” with your Platinum card or another card.

And as of 2021 the Amex Gold Card now has Uber Cash of its own too. Add your Gold Card to your Uber account and each month automatically get $10 in Uber Cash for Uber Eats orders or Uber rides in the U.S. totaling up to $120 per year.

This credit is “use it or lose it.” You'll forfeit any unused balance each month will be forfeited if you don't use it up.

Up to $189 for CLEAR Membership

Haven't signed up for CLEAR Plus the privately run airport security program? If you've got either the Platinum or Green Card you've got no reason not to.

Both cards carry annual credits that can get you signed up for CLEAR allowing you to cut to the front of the line at dozens of U.S. airports. Amex even improved the Green Card's credit late last year bumping it up to $189 a year – enough to cover the full cost.

These credits reset with the calendar year. Just use either card to pay for your annual CLEAR Plus membership and it should trigger automatically within a few days. But you can do better than just using these credits to pay for your own membership.

Here's how. All Delta SkyMiles or United MileagePlus frequent flyer members can enroll in CLEAR for just $119. Even if you’re not a frequent flyer with either Delta or United you can quickly sign up for a free SkyMiles or MileagePlus account to capitalize on this lower cost. Once you have a frequent flyer account number with either program you can enroll through the specific link above and link your frequent flyer account number.

From there CLEAR allows you to add up to three adult “family members” to your account for an additional $60 each year per family member. Kids under the age of 18 can accompany CLEAR members through the CLEAR lane for free – there's no need to add them to your plan. And members on your Family Plan can use CLEAR anytime they're traveling: You don't have to be traveling with them to unlock that benefit.

So long as you signed up for CLEAR at a discounted price through either Delta or United the new $189 credit on the Green Card or Platinum Card will completely cover your own membership and up to one additional traveler on a Family Plan.

Up to $100 Off Saks Fifth Avenue for Platinum Cardholders

Each year of Platinum card membership you get two up to $50 credits to use at Saks Fifth Avenue.

One $50 credit is available from Jan. 1 through June 30 with another $50 available July 1 through Dec. 31. Like the other credits available on the Platinum card you will lose any remaining balance you have after the expiration date. Enrollment is required.

The offer can be used both in-store and online but per the terms and conditions of this offer it will not work to purchase gift cards.

Saks Fifth Avenue isn’t the cheapest place to shop but you should be able to find a few things each year to use your credit on. And make sure to stack any purchase you make with a shopping portal like Rakuten (formerly Ebates) to earn cashback – or American Express points.

Read our post on 7 ways to use your Saks Fifth Avenue credit.



Amex Gold Card Dining Credit

Each year of Amex Gold Card membership you get $120 worth of dining credits. Each cardholder will be issued $10 each month and like the other credits from Amex you will lose any remaining balance you have after the expiration date.

The credits can be used at GrubHub The Cheesecake Factory Wine.com Goldbelly Milk Bar and participating Shake Shack locations. This benefit is not available to Amex Platinum or Green cardholders.

Amex Green Card Lounge Buddy Credit

The Amex Green card now offers an annual $100 credit to use at Lounge Buddy a Priority Pass competitor. Lounge Buddy offers single-use airport lounge access passes starting at just $25 each. That means the credit can get you into lounges up to four times each calendar year at no additional cost. That makes it a decent option if you don’t have any airport lounge access from another card like the Platinum Card® from American Express.

Like all Amex credits the balance will not roll over into 2024 if you don't use the full $100 this year.

Up to $400 in Dell Credits on the Amex Platinum Business Card

There are plenty of reasons for small business owners to open the Business Platinum Card® from American Express. And one of those is the up to $400 in credits issued each year for purchases at Dell.com.

Similar to how the Saks credit works on the Personal Platinum Card you will get one $200 credit available from Jan. 1 through June 30 with another $200 available July 1 through Dec. 31 each year. Amex doubled these credits and added other perks last year when it announced it would raise the annual fee from its current $550 to $695 (see rates & fees) for new applicants last year.

You might be surprised at how many products are available on Dell's website. It is far from just computers. Think Bose headphones Google Home & Nest products and much more. Just make sure to stack any purchase you make with a shopping portal like Rakuten.

Bottom Line

For team patron Roger Penske the goal is clear: he wants to fulfill his longtime dream of winning Le Mans.

With workshops of the great North American racing teams lining its streets Mooresville in the US state of North Carolina feels much like an oversized pit lane. One of the most successful of these workshops has its own street – at 200 Penske Way the two Porsche 963s are being prepared for factory competitions in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship organized by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA). They’re in good company with the Penske team as they share their home with dozens of NASCAR and IndyCar race cars.

In 2004 Roger Penske began relocating all of his racing programs to the location here which measures 42 hectares in size. He owns the IndyCar Series the highest formula class in North America as well as the famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Motorsport is the 85-year-old’s biggest passion – and yet just a small part of his empire. The Penske Corporation generates over 37 billion US dollars in sales annually at 3200 locations and employs 67000 people. The transport segment consists of more than 400000 trucks on four continents.

Roger Penske

Appropriately the only partner community of Mooresville with its population of 50000 is the German motorsport city of Hockenheim where Penske’s German residence is close to the Formula 1 course. Mannheim is home to one of the world’s 20 Penske Porsche Centers and more recently the second LMDh factory team for which Roger Penske invested in a complex structure and created state-of-the-art furnishings. Porsche covers the costs for all of the mobile equipment and the crew. Forty-five experts are preparing two Porsche 963s here for the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). And there are just as many employees on the Porsche Penske Motorsport team for the IMSA campaigns in Mooresville.

A management team of four

A management team of four ensures that just about everything runs synchronously at both locations. As director of LMDh Factory Motorsport Urs Kuratle oversees everything on behalf of Porsche Motorsport. Jonathan Diuguid is managing director of Porsche Penske Motorsport Travis Law is competition director for all locations and Christian Eifrig is technical project manager. Under the management of these four Mooresville and Mannheim have parallel structures each with a team manager and head mechanic two vehicle heads racing engineers and mechanics. All of the network threads come together at the Porsche Development Center in Weissach which in turn is responsible for distributing information.

“An overarching committee of just four people is a very streamlined structure which is why the work is so demanding for all of us” says Kuratle who hails from Switzerland. In 2013 he made the switch from Formula 1 to the former endurance program with the successful Porsche 919 Hybrid in Weissach. “We each have a clearly defined area of expertise. The four of us complement each other perfectly and organize all of the operations together.” A powerful data line ensures seamless inter­continental transmission between the Mooresville Mannheim and Weissach locations. In operation rooms on both sides of the Atlantic engineers and managers are stationed at long tables with their headsets and screens.

Streamlined structure

Kuratle (54) is responsible not only for all things related to factory campaigns including the budget but also for something entirely new: “No one had ever even attempted to offer such technologically advanced customer vehicles from the very start. And even now we’re the only ones doing that” he says. “Porsche has made an extremely powerful commitment to the new top category in endurance sports which cannot be compared with the past tradition of customer teams.” The 963 is a highly complex hybrid race car and the customers are top international teams who have what it takes. Established companies with their own technical directors engineers and mechanics sponsorship and marketing departments top drivers and their own simulators.



A 963 costs around 2.5 million euros plus operating costs of around eight to ten million euros a season. These investments need to pay off and the only currency is success. “These teams fight it out for overall wins just like the factory cars” explains Kuratle. “That’s their objective. That’s what they owe their sponsors – and we want to make that possible for them.”

Dress rehearsal: The 963 on a test run at Daytona International Speedway. It will make its racing debut here in late January 2023. Endurance: During the two-day test in the US state of Florida the 963 completed a total of 2274 kilometers. Real conditions: 35 degrees Celsius 90 percent humidity rain and thunder. The test was a true challenge – for both the team and the race car.

In addition to the two factory cars in the IMSA and the WEC the first customer vehicles will also compete in the 2023 debut season. Expanding Porsche’s tradition of customer racing into this league is a great achievement as anyone who purchases a Porsche receives extensive literature user manuals and catalogs and needs to be able to order spare parts. Kuratle manages that with his team of five and with specialists in different areas of development.

Months before homologation which refers to the 963’s official competition approval JDC-Miller MotorSports (USA) and Jota (UK) were the first two customer teams to purchase a new prototype for IMSA and WEC campaigns. For the 2024 season Porsche plans to double the number of customer vehicles in both racing series from two to four. There’s no shortage of requests as the brand enjoys a high level of trust.

Roger Penske – the captain

Trust is good but understanding is better. “You can’t manage a company unless you understand every last detail” says Roger Penske whose nickname is the Captain. Another maxim: “The most important thing is to take good care of your employees. They need to work in an environment they can make mistakes in. We discuss them and then learn from them together.” And the Captain practices what he preaches. When he shows up in the pit he knows all of his employees by name and asks for information about countless details.



If he eats a hot dog he cleans up his table when he’s done and thanks the kitchen staff. Penske is wide awake – even after more than 30 hours without sleep 24 of which he has spent watching the Le Mans pit on two 60-inch monitors which is exactly what he did last June during the long-standing endurance event. Tirelessly he makes a mental note of average times evaluates pit stops and motivates his drivers personally by radio: “Hi. RP speaking. You are doing a great job!” At the same time he follows his vehicles’ campaigns in the NASCAR and IndyCar Series and out of interest analyzes the Formula 1 qualifying and race on his smartphone.



All of his questions are answered during the award ceremony for the 24 Hours race on the traditional French racecourse. Behind the main stand he takes off in one of his six private long-haul airplanes for the next meeting. The father of five will be touching down again at this airport in June as there’s one success still missing from his life’s work: an overall win in Le Mans with Porsche.

Roger Penske

More than 600 wins and 42 championship titles in different series 18 wins in the Indianapolis 500 three Daytona 500 titles one Formula 1 victory additional overall wins in the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring and a triumph in the 1000-kilometer race in Bathurst Australia – those are Roger Penske’s achievements thus far as head of the team. He ended his career as a race car driver in 1965 – for the benefit of entrepreneurship. Until that time he’d won 28 races with Porsche race cars alone from the 550 RS to the 718 RSK. With his racing team established in 1966 he celebrated successes with the legendary Porsche 917 in the Can-Am series fell in love with the brand and began developing his dealer network in the 1970s. From 2006 to 2008 the team won three championship titles in the LMP2 class of the American Le Mans Series with the Porsche RS Spyder. Penske is mounting another attack to secure the final feather in his cap: the Le Mans win with a Porsche.

The Team in Action

Eleven races in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and seven endurance races in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC): the tournament with the new Porsche 963 LMDh car takes Porsche Penske Motorsport to eight nations on three continents from January to November.

The dozens of dead birds were found mostly within a 100 yard radius around the tower where the town hangs stuffed vulture effigies to ward off the living birds that were roosting and dropping waste on the tower.

The carcasses were scattered about -- like they dropped right out of the sky.

Paul MacKinnon who works for American Wildlife Refuge believes the birds appear to have been poisoned.

Alternately other wildlife experts believe it could be Avian flu. Earlier this week a wildlife sanctuary reported that a highly contagious bird flu was spreading across the eastern part of the state according to an article on WITN.

If the deaths are caused by Avian flu however experts say it seems strange only vultures would have been impacted.

It's illegal to poison or kill a vulture in North Carolina.

Steve Stone director of animal care at American Wildlife Refuge went out to the area to see the damage and take video. He uploaded a live video to Facebook.

Wildlife mystery: Over 40 dead vultures surround water tower in Fuquay-Varina

""We found about 50 vultures dead yesterday"" he said.

He says the deaths of these scavengers will lead to bigger problems in town. Vultures he says clean up around 39000 pounds of dead animals each year.

""I think a little bit of poop on your windshield is worth that"" he says.

The town wants to remind people that it is illegal to shoot or poison buzzards or turkey vultures.

The State Wildlife Resources Commission told WRAL News the vulture deaths were ""almost certainly"" caused by avian influenza. The commission says it's documented other bird flu deaths in this general area since November.

In October 2017 Brett Morrow a 22-year-old rugby player known as “String Bean” to his teammates died while helping to install a plastic liner inside a Chicago-area sewer pipe. He had descended a 20-foot-deep manhole and then crawled 30 feet into the newly lined pipe measuring two feet in diameter. At some point the plastic liner crumpled and started to harden around him. A dangerous concentration of an ingredient in the liner styrene seeped out as gas and likely crippled him. Morrow drowned in liquid generated by the installation process according to a medical examiner’s report. The drowning caused his death but the styrene incapacitation was a “significant contributing factor” the report stated. It took nearly four hours for firefighters to free his body.

Six months later the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) levied $77604 in penalties against Benchmark Construction Company Inc. the Bartlett Illinois-based firm contracted for the pipe work. OSHA cited Benchmark for exposing employees to airborne concentrations of styrene gas exceeding federal industrial safety standards failure to test the air in the manhole and pipe for water and dangerous gases and more. Benchmark contested the OSHA finding and ultimately paid $55000 to the agency and improved its safety operations OSHA records show.

“People make mistakes and these things happen” said Benchmark President Mark Atkins who only spoke with Undark he adds to help prevent future workplace tragedies. “There are safety guidelines in place and all of them weren’t followed and then you have an accident an unfortunate accident.”

Atkins would not discuss the case in detail due to an ongoing civil lawsuit brought by Richard Morrow Brett’s father. Matthew Belcher Richard Morrow’s attorney says the lawsuit isn’t for financial gain and any proceeds would be devoted to increasing awareness of the hazards associated with these chemical exposures. “It remains the goal of the Morrow family” Belcher said “that no one else will have to bury their son because of a similar exposure.”

Benchmark is one small player in an industry that is virtually unknown to the public but has been fixing crumbling infrastructure in the United States for more than 40 years. The industry rehabilitates underground pipes — primarily for sewage and stormwater but increasingly for drinking water too — using a technology called cured-in-place pipe or CIPP. With this approach which is one of the most popular pipe repair technologies in the country new plastic pipes are chemically manufactured inside old damaged pipes. According to Stratview Research a market research company the global market for CIPP is set to reach $2.6 billion by 2023.

Members of the CIPP industry and their customers — mostly cities counties and sewer and water districts — routinely say the pipe-lining installations are safe. But a 2017 report from Andrew Whelton a civil and environmental engineer and his colleagues at Purdue University suggests otherwise. The Purdue study primarily funded by the National Science Foundation was the first evaluation of CIPP emissions into the air to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The study also documented 59 incidents around the world in which residents complained about the odor at CIPP jobs or reported feeling sick after being exposed to job site emissions. Since then the team has identified more than 40 additional such incidents.

In 2011 for example two day care centers one in Worcester Massachusetts and one in Port Huron Michigan were evacuated in separate incidents when fumes from CIPP work overcame children and staffers. The same year fumes from a CIPP installation sent five students and a high school staff member in Birmingham Michigan to the hospital. In September 2017 some 36 students reportedly fell sick with nausea coughing or headaches due to fumes from an installation at an elementary school in San Diego.

In some CIPP exposure cases residents temporarily moved out of their homes. A family in Prairie Village Kansas was driven to a hotel for a night in 2014 to escape the fumes after an installation near their home. The father called the exposure experience “ghastly.” That same year a retiree moved out of her townhouse in Baltimore for three and a half weeks to escape fumes and odors associated with a CIPP project in front of her home.

Cases like these combined with Morrow’s death and recent studies have convinced Whelton that the safety of CIPP installation work is questionable and the Purdue team’s report has put a national spotlight on an industry that has worked for years to deflect and minimize concerns about plastic-lined pipes releasing potentially hazardous levels of chemicals into air water soil and homes. “I’ve seen enough evidence to recognize that exposure to CIPP emissions can be harmful” he said “and something needs to be done immediately to change the practice.”

The report also inflamed an already tense relationship between members of the industry and Whelton culminating in intimidating letters from the industry attacks on social media and legal threats. So far Whelton is unfazed. “First of all who gave you permission to pump this stuff into my private property or commercial building?” he said. “And second of all why? Why are we allowing this to happen?”

Even without industry resistance Whelton’s call for change won’t come easy. Updates to the nation’s sewer and water infrastructure have been sluggish for decades in part because it is expensive and time-consuming to keep up with demand. One million miles of underground water pipes in the U.S. need to be replaced according to a 2012 report from the American Water Works Association. The report estimated that restoring and expanding the nation’s water mains will cost at least $1 trillion through 2035. And $271 billion will be required in the next few years to do the same for the nation’s sewers and other wastewater infrastructure according to a 2016 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report.

For decades the main option for replacing old pipes was to dig long trenches to extract and replace them. Then first in the 1970s and with more force in the 1990s the CIPP industry offered utilities and other customers a cheaper and faster solution. Rather than extracting and replacing entire pipes CIPP installers could access an existing pipe at manholes and then feed in liners that would blanket the full length of a pipe interior covering all leaks corrosion and other wear and tear. The industry has installed cured-in-place liners inside more than 35000 miles of pipe worldwide according to a 2017 BCC Research market report which is enough to circle the globe nearly one and half times.

One reason CIPP installation is faster and cheaper is because it essentially manufactures plastic pipes outdoors. Other common plastic pipes such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes common in household plumbing are made in closed internally ventilated factories where hazardous byproducts are relatively easy to capture contain and monitor. By contrast most CIPP work takes place wherever the aging pipes are located. The liners start as felt fiberglass or other composite tubes embedded with resin. The tubes then undergo a chemical process called curing that hardens them into plastic when exposed to hot water steam or ultraviolet light. During curing a plume of material can rise to the surface and stream into the air.

This raises safety questions Whelton says about the types of chemicals emitted and the amounts that may cause health or environmental problems. “All those questions weren’t really an issue inside of a manufacturing facility because you would have a ventilation system that would suck up all that material” he said. “But you don’t have that with cured-in-place pipe technology.”

The CIPP industry does have to comply with regulations from OSHA including those designed to protect workers in confined spaces like the one where Morrow died as well as the Clean Water Act administered by the EPA. There are also state and local regulations. But it’s unclear how effective all of these rules are given the paucity of reliable data and independent monitoring.

The plumes from steam-cured CIPP installations hold a soup of partially cured plastic liquified resin and volatile organic compounds which Whelton’s team described for the first time in the 2017 study. Without respirators and gloves workers and others nearby risk inhaling and touching these compounds. One compound is styrene a key ingredient in most of the resins which reportedly incapacitated Morrow at the Chicago-area installation.

According to the National Toxicology Program styrene is “reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen” and the EPA classifies it as a hazardous air pollutant. Styrene exposure affects the human nervous system and can cause headaches fatigue hearing loss eye and other mucous membrane irritation concentration problems and slowed reaction times. Workplace styrene exposure is also linked to respiratory disease.

While Whelton’s team has found other hazardous air pollutants at CIPP installations including dibutyl phthalate and phenol discussions of CIPP emissions often focus only on styrene. Most of the jumble of federal limits on styrene pertain to workers. OSHA regulations limit a CIPP installer’s average exposure during an 8-hour workday to under 100 parts per million (ppm) the equivalent of 100 grains of sugar in 273 sugar cubes. The agency limits exposure at any one time to 200 ppm and spikes of styrene should never exceed 600 ppm for five minutes in any three-hour period.

According to the National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) one of the industry’s primary trade organizations in North America with about 620 member organizations various job sites have been monitored for styrene for decades and the industry employs its own voluntary limit of 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period. “I think anyone in the CIPP industry would agree that the styrene emissions on job sites are well below the industry standards for styrene emissions” said Lynn Osborn NASSCO’s technical director.

It’s hard to fact-check NASSCO’s claims because no federal agency seems to tally and break down emissions violations in the CIPP industry. Still accumulating peer-reviewed research suggests that some CIPP workers are exposed to unsafe levels of styrene. And in at least one case styrene overexposure is well documented by a government agency. Morrow was exposed to concentrations of styrene in the air ranging from 220 to 270 ppm according to an OSHA investigation released in April 2018 — exceeding the 200 ppm OSHA exposure ceiling. The OSHA report says Morrow was exposed to styrene for up to four hours.

Industry resistance to CIPP research that raises safety concerns stretches back more than a decade. The first studies focused on environmental contaminations mainly of streams and freshwater life at job sites in Virginia. In the mid-2000s an employee from the Virginia Transportation Research Council part of the state Department of Transportation noticed a filmy resin leaching into a stream from a plastic-lined stormwater culvert that the state had recently installed. The film prompted Bridget Donaldson a research scientist with the council to test the water. She collected water at several other installations over the course of a year. In some cases she found styrene levels that would have been toxic to water fleas and rainbow trout species that biologists use to measure water quality.

“I had absolutely no desire to do a study that showed that the people that pay my salary are buying this product that is potentially environmentally damaging” Donaldson said. “The Virginia Department of Transportation wants to use this technology. It just wants to use it in an environmentally safe way.”

Still Donaldson’s results were troubling. In 2007 her work led to a temporary ban on new CIPP projects at culverts maintained by the state transportation department. The following year the department lifted the ban after setting new regulations which required installers to capture resin debris wastewater and rinse water and dispose of it at wastewater treatment plants. Despite the reversal the industry went on the defensive.

A large CIPP company the name of which Donaldson wouldn’t share with Undark on the record requested her data under public records laws. She complied. And during a session at a 2009 trade conference dedicated to discussing her results Ed Kampbell an engineer with decades of experience studying and working with CIPP criticized her sampling methods and conclusions. In a write-up of his presentation in a trade publication Kampbell wrote that “good housekeeping” to prevent and clean-up resin spills and complete curing will “lead to a proper cure and a long CIPP life; and in this author’s opinion no measurable environmental impact.” But her findings withstood the test of time: Studies in three other states have since documented CIPP culvert installations with similar water pollution.

(There have also been documented cases of incidental drinking water contamination occurring during the installation of CIPP liners but scant research addresses the safety of drinking water that is delivered through pipes that have been repaired using the CIPP process. The industries and organizations that provide drinking water and related infrastructure typically comply with regulatory standards set by NSF International a Michigan-based not-for-profit organization as well as state standards set in accordance with the U.S. EPA’s limits on dozens of contaminants. However Whelton says that there are no U.S. drinking water standards for many of the chemicals that limited research suggests could be released from CIPP water pipes.)

The conflict between research science and the cured-in-place pipe industry came to a boil in 2015 when Elena Ajdari then a graduate student at the University of New Orleans captured air emissions at several CIPP projects in a major U.S. city as the basis of her dissertation. Ajdari would not reveal the location to Undark to comply with a request from the city.

Ajdari hired an independent lab to analyze her samples which found styrene levels peaking at 250 289 and 1070 ppm. The results alarmed Ajdari.

“I didn’t think that I would discover something very new” said Ajdari. “But then I got the result at the end of the project and I understood that I did something very big.”

Whelton who had assisted with Ajdari’s study design routinely cites her dissertation and says the research was done in Los Angeles. In late 2015 Whelton traveled to Los Angeles and met with a handful of city staffers in the Bureau of Engineering to provide more context for Ajdari’s findings which included demonstrating her air testing equipment and explaining how she collected samples. Afterwards Whelton alerted several other state utilities to the Los Angeles findings.

About a week later in early December Edward Arrington then a senior engineer in the Los Angeles bureau sent an email to Whelton that disavowed knowledge of the very data collection and analysis that Whelton had presented. Arrington added: “Under no circumstances should you include or infer any involvement by the city of Los Angeles in any of your presentations discussion correspondence etc. regarding this matter.”

News of Whelton’s discussions about the Los Angeles findings also reached Ted DeBoda then the executive director of NASSCO. In February 2016 DeBoda responded through a certified letter delivered to Whelton at Purdue. The letter asked Whelton to “refrain from further meetings with owners who utilize or are considering the use of CIPP for sewer rehabilitation until we can develop a dialogue.” The letter also said that NASSCO disagreed with the findings turned up by Ajdari and requested a “constructive dialogue” between Whelton and the organization “to ensure the public has the most reliable information.”

Whelton passed the letter to university lawyers and continued his work.

In July 2017 Whelton and his colleagues published the air emissions findings that ratcheted up the dispute with the CIPP industry. At each field site for the study the CIPP installers used steam to harden or cure the resin a common technique. The results showed the emissions weren’t just steam as industry members typically describe them and drew more publicity than past studies. Some customers including the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority approached contractors and NASSCO to ask if the pipe lining technique was safe.

A heated public exchange ensued. Right after the Purdue study came out NASSCO formed a group to address the findings. Members included industry representatives from the American Composites Manufacturers Association NSF International and the North American Society for Trenchless Technology.

The NASSCO group reviewed the Purdue study and decided that “claims regarding the safety of steam-cured CIPP installations are premature and certainly not conclusive” according to an October 19 2017 recap by Osborn in the trade publication Trenchless Technology.

In August 2017 NASSCO took direct aim at the study in a press release riddled with errors such as describing the work as a study “completed by [Whelton’s] students” “without any apparent peer review.” In fact the paper’s 11 co-authors include six faculty and five students — four graduate students and one undergraduate at the time. And the journal in which the Purdue study was published Environmental Science & Technology Letters is peer-reviewed.

NASSCO did make a correct point: Whelton’s group did not run its findings past the industry group prior to publication. But scientists often publish results without consulting funding agencies or organizations in order to maintain intellectual independence. And contrary to a claim by the trade group the research team consulted NASSCO material and other industry sources for their report including information from a day-and-a-half long NASSCO training on pipe-lining installation which Whelton attended in person.

The trade group’s press release also announced a plan for a rebuttal report “an independent study and research program that will be properly peer reviewed to challenge and/or confirm the information developed and published previously.” NASSCO published its request for proposals in September 2017 listing four CIPP emissions studies that researchers must examine — the Whelton group’s 2017 study Ajdari’s dissertation one of Donaldson’s water quality studies and another state transportation agency study.

Also that September the Purdue team published online a detailed public response to the NASSCO press release saying that it “made many incorrect assertions.” The Purdue statement estimated that in the history of CIPP installations “thousands if not more people may have been chemically exposed at worksites in their homes offices schools and day care centers.” The team recommended that CIPP companies immediately notify all current and former clients that they can’t rule out CIPP-related health risks.

Meanwhile some industry members spoke out on social media. For instance Eric Sullivan a NASSCO trainer posted an essay on LinkedIn casting doubt on the Purdue study and disparaging Whelton and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) a professional organization. NEHA had hosted a webinar in which Whelton presented the study results. “It’s clear that both Whelton and NEHA have a significant lack of understanding of the most basic configurations of sewer collection systems” Sullivan wrote. “The impact of this is that it risks misrepresenting the results of the study and grossly exaggerating the potential hazards themselves if any of the CIPP steam cure method.”

In December 2017 NASSCO released updated guidelines for the use and handling of styrene-based resins in plastic-lined pipe work. Recommendations included “proper personal protective equipment” the maintenance of a perimeter around the job site to keep the public out and “good housekeeping practices.” Regarding the 2017 Purdue findings the update stated “no evidence was produced regarding the health effects of CIPP steam exhaust on either workers or the public.” While it’s true that the study did not measure human health effects these were outside its scope. The Purdue study did however show that condensed emissions captured at two of the job sites were at levels toxic to mouse lung cells and immune cells.

The updated guidelines also stated “there have been no noted serious consequences reported” in the history of CIPP’s use of the two mostly widely used types of resin. However Brett Morrow whose death was attributed in part to styrene toxicity died on the job two months before the guidelines published.

In March 2018 NASSCO announced a new executive director: Sheila Joy who had a background in marketing including some work with the CIPP industry. The previous executive director Ted DeBoda was a civil engineer and had resigned in January.

Then on March 14 2018 when Whelton was out of town a letter was delivered by certified mail to his home and handed to his wife. The letter from a lawyer for Insituform Technologies LLC a leading CIPP company in North America accused Whelton of “environmental alarmism” and stated in part that “Insituform insists that you cease and desist your disparaging comments against Insituform and CIPP immediately.”

The Insituform letter also stated that Whelton in an article he co-authored in a monthly magazine for members of the American Public Works Association failed to acknowledge “that the most likely cause of Brett Morrow’s death was overexposure to the hydrogen sulfide gas typically found in sewer gas and not due to overexposure to styrene and other VOC gases related to the CIPP project.” There is no mention of hydrogen sulfide in Morrow’s autopsy report of November 27 2017.

The letter also described “the Whelton Group” as a business seeking commercial gain. The characterization could stem from a patent application the Purdue Research Foundation filed in 2017 for a system that captures separates and analyzes emissions from pipe-lining job sites. The application names Whelton and four of his Purdue colleagues as inventors.

Whelton counters that his team didn’t invent the system to start a business but out of necessity. They needed a such a device to speed up their work and couldn’t find one so they built it themselves. As of this writing Whelton hasn’t formed a company related to the system and says he has no plans to do so. “We didn’t get into this because we wanted to patent something” he said. “Our focus has been and continues to be science — figuring out what the materials are in and released by CIPP how to capture them and providing guidance to health officials so they can make decisions regarding exposures.”

Stephen Callahan vice president of global human resources and safety for Aegion Insituform’s parent company says of its profit assertion that “Whelton’s claims merit further questioning.”

Again Whelton handed the letter to university lawyers and continued his work.

But the tension persisted says Mike Burkhard a former executive director of NASSCO and now executive director of business and technology at Reline America a Virginia-based company that makes fiberglass liners and installation systems for them: The whole industry he said was “in an uproar.”

In December 2017 as promised NASSCO launched its self-study. The first of two phases was the review of past studies a task NASSCO assigned to the Center for Underground Infrastructure Research and Education (CUIRE) at the University of Texas at Arlington. A primary funding source for CUIRE is industry and the center is overseen in part by a board that includes an Insituform technical manager and Lynn Osborn the NASSCO technical director. The second phase of the study launched in June 2018 to collect and analyze data from several CIPP installation sites. NASSCO announced that the Trenchless Technology Center at Louisiana Tech University would do this work in a partnership with the Army Corps of Engineers’ Engineer Research and Development Center. The Louisiana Tech center also receives significant industry funding and includes CIPP industry board members.

The literature review completed last year echoed the NASSCO group’s original response raising doubts about the methodologies of the CIPP emissions studies they looked at and deeming the research results “not conclusive.” The second-phase results are expected to be released in the next few months. “NASSCO has nothing to gain by CIPP being proven safe or unsafe” said Joy the new executive director. “I want these studies to come out 100 percent pure clean impartial.”

Osborn also wants trustworthy findings. “Everyone I visit with and talk to is interested in one result and that is to get to the truth whether it be Dr. Whelton’s side or the individual contractors who are out there doing testing” he said. “Because obviously they want to protect their workers and the public and NASSCO.”

In the meantime most CIPP installations are proceeding as they were. But in some small ways Purdue’s work is already prompting changes. Following conversations with Whelton Pleasants Construction a Maryland-based CIPP installation company requested a voluntary federal evaluation of potential hazards at its work sites including styrene emissions. Researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did the study and the results came out in January.

As part of the study NIOSH researchers measured styrene levels at a UV light-cured installation site both when the ventilation fans were temporarily turned off and during regular use. With the ventilator off one worker was exposed to 140 ppm of styrene while grinding a cured pipe — exceeding the NIOSH recommended 15-minute exposure limit. When it was on styrene levels were below NIOSH’s safety limit of 100 ppm averaged across a 15-minute interval.

Overall the analysis pinpointed specific installations tasks — such as cutting and taping liners and grinding cured pipes — that can put workers at risk for exposures to styrene and other volatile organic compounds. In their report the NIOSH researchers recommended manhole ventilation when workers are interacting with uncured or cured liners and endorsed other safety measures the company already takes such as bagging used gloves and excess liner immediately after it is ground off.

Any company can request a NIOSH health hazards evaluation which is free but so far only a handful of state agencies and companies have come forward. “We’re in the infancy of really investigating this” said Ryan LeBouf the research chemist and industrial hygienist at NIOSH who headed the Pleasants evaluation.

Whelton and his colleagues also are making recommendations for people at or near CIPP lining installations: No one should inhale installation fumes. Workers and others at job sites should wear face masks and gloves and avoid touching materials. Contractors should capture emitted gases curing waters and vapors scraps of resin and other waste. Work sites should be monitored to ensure that fumes are being contained.

Without such measures the Purdue team maintains that more ecosystems and people including workers will be harmed. And the health threats to workers which can be fatal as was the case for Brett Morrow particularly sadden Whelton.

“This young kid 22 years old healthy succumbed to an organization that refused to acknowledge the chemical safety issues associated with their technology” Whelton said. “And that incident happened months after the consistent and widespread attacks on the research where we raised up a hand and said ‘There’s an issue here that you need to investigate.’”

UPDATE: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the concentration of styrene affecting Brett Morrow. The levels referenced are for the estimated styrene concentration in the air he was exposed to not in his blood.

The city has reached 500 homicides for the second year in a row. The opioid epidemic is still raging in Kensington (and elsewhere). And Philly remains America’s poorest large city with about 23 percent of residents living below the federal poverty level.

But Dan Rhoton executive director of the Camden NJ-based nonprofit Hopeworks sees reason for well hope in the City of Brotherly Love.

Rhoton remembers 2012 when it wasn’t Philly but his city that was making headlines. Back then Camden was widely considered America’s poorest and most violent city. They set a local homicide record in 2012 with 59 murders. NBC’s Brian Williams visited Camden with his show Rock Center in 2013 to gawk at its problems. Later that year Rolling Stone dubbed the city “apocalyptic” and the “most desperate town” in the U.S.

“Camden was the unsolvable problem in 2012 2011 2010” Rhoton says.

“You change lives one at a time but you need a machine to end poverty” Rhoton says. “We’ve been building a poverty-ending machine.”

Slowly things started to turn around. In 2013 Camden disbanded its entire police force. Then the force introduced better less aggressive policing tactics rebuilding community trust and reducing homicides 65 percent over 10 years. In 2020 and 2021 when crime ballooned nationwide the city saw its lowest crime level in more than 50 years WHYY reported.

Hopeworks meanwhile brought job training and employment programs to Camden. The 23-year-old nonprofit helps train young people aged 17 to 26 for jobs in the tech sector and then partners with employers to get them jobs. In the past 10 years they’ve helped over 900 people secure work with average starting salaries of $43000 per year. Once trainees enter these good jobs they tend to keep them. The program has a 12-month retention rate of close to 90 percent.

Now an even bigger ambition

Now Rhoton has his eyes set on an even bigger and some believe unsolvable problem: reducing poverty in Philly. Hopeworks received a $600000 investment from the GreenLight Fund to bring the organization’s proven model to Kensington. They opened a second location on J Street in mid-December and plan to train 50 participants for tech jobs with their employer partners in the first year and double the number of people they can help in the second.

“Hopeworks loves being in a space in places where folks say that problems are unsolvable” Rhoton says. “We love being part of proving them wrong.”

Hopeworks launched in 1999 when a group of three churches in Camden set out to launch an employment training program. Their three-month paid training program teaches trainees necessary skills by giving them hands-on experience working for Hopeworks’ three businesses: a web design firm a data organization and visualization service and a trauma training program for businesses.

After the training period Hopeworks helps connect students with internships and full-time jobs outside the organization with employers ranging from New Jersey’s American Water to Philadelphia’s Comcast NBCUniversal. Each year they work with between 20 and 24 different companies to help place Hopeworks candidates in jobs. Throughout the training process young people receive academic and career coaching services and housing support services through the company’s C.R.I.B. program. That way they have many of the tools they need to complete the training.

The program has long pondered expanding. In 2017 they partnered with JEVS Human Services to conduct a small five month pilot program in Philly. After that program ended they realized it was often easier and less expensive for Philadelphia students to get into Camden than to other parts of the city.

But as interest in Hopeworks continued to grow Rhoton found that one office could not support all of the young people in Camden and Philly who wanted to learn the tech skills necessary to get jobs that paid living wages. What’s more employers in the technology sector were clamoring for new talent. At local tech meetups over the last few years Rhoton has talked with company after company looking to grow its workforce. He points them to Hopeworks’ trainees.

“There’s only a labor shortage if you keep looking in the same places you’ve always looked” he says. “If you actually start doing things a little differently there are plenty of folks that are ready for opportunity.”

“Hopeworks loves being in a space in places where folks say that problems are unsolvable” Rhoton says. “We love being part of proving them wrong.”

That’s where the GreenLight Fund comes in. The national nonprofit helps organizations with proven track records of success open locations in new cities. This year the Philadelphia chapter wanted to bring an organization that helped address digital inequities to the city. They searched the country and found that Hopeworks right across the river was a perfect fit.

“We essentially just landed on Hopeworks as the organization that we’re going to invest in because of their local sustainability and their proven model” says Felicia Rinier executive director for the Philadelphia GreenLight Fund.

Once GreenLight announced that they were helping bring Hopeworks to Philly other organizations jumped in to help support the launch. Comcast JP Morgan & Chase The NBA Foundation the Connelly Foundation and Dell Technologies have all offered additional financial support for the launch.

With the financial resources in hand to support a second location Hopeworks began looking for a place to open a second office. They settled on Kensington for three reasons: its proximity to the El making it easy for trainees to travel from across the city; nearby tech companies located in Fishtown and Northern Liberties; and the fact that many neighborhood residents struggle with poverty and are looking for better job opportunities.

“The first thing we learned in Camden is if you want to help if you want to work with folks experiencing poverty you can’t do it from Center City” Rhoton says. “You have to be proximate to poverty.”

Hopeworks’ model too is adept at managing the challenges Kensington and Philly more broadly face. The nonprofit uses an approach known as the Sanctuary Model which helps participants confront some of the trauma they may have faced whether from poverty violence or drug crime.

“Kensington has real issues” Rhoton says. “Trauma-informed care is this acknowledgment when you do work you actually work with humans that have history and emotions.”

The Kensington location opened its doors December 15. By the second day trainees who used to commute from Philly to the Camden location were training new recruits on basic web development and coding skills. By day four the Kensington location already had enough trainees to fill its 25-seat training setup.

Rhoton hopes that one day the Philadelphia location will have the same effects on the city that its predecessor in Camden has had: tackling poverty by helping young people find good high-paying jobs.

“You change lives one at a time but you need a machine to end poverty” Rhoton says. “We’ve been building a poverty-ending machine.”

Sanofi a case involving Section 112 of the Patent Act that could have harmful consequences for innovation in tech fields like software computing electronics and telecom if ruled on. The organizations which represent a diverse group of technology companies urged the Court to dismiss the case or strongly narrow its opinion to protect innovation in technology.

CCIA and HTIA argue that Amgen v. Sanofi is an ill-suited tool for altering Section 112 which supports the delicate balance of the U.S. patents system by codifying essential disclosure and claim requirements. A ruling on the case risks creating barriers for new tech innovations by upsetting established rules against purely functional claims in patents.

The Computer & Communications Industry Association has advocated for tech policy that advances innovation including sound patent policy for over 50 years.

The oncology company received backing from leading investor Westlake Village BioPartners with participation from several others.

“I think they’re different than a lot of venture capitalists in that they really do understand drug development in a different way than a lot of other firms do because they’ve done it” Dr. Richard Markus Dantari’s chief executive and president said of Westlake Village BioPartners. “That kind of support and backing really is a difference that is unique to them.”

Dr. Beth Seidenberg and Dr. Sean Harper Westlake’s co-founding managing partners both have extensive experience in the clinical research field.

Markus added that Westlake’s successful track record in the venture space was another reason for trusting it to lead the series A round. The venture capital firm’s portfolio includes other local companies such as Acelyrin and Capsida Biotherapeutics. In September Acelyrin closed a $300 million series C round to fund phase 3 development of immunology treatments.

“The Dantari team has made great progress in building a world-class platform for oncology drug innovation. Dantari’s proprietary T-HDC platform provides significantly enhanced capabilities for targeted delivery of therapeutics which I believe will usher in a step-change in the treatment of solid tumors” Harper said in a statement. “With Richard at the helm and this outstanding team we look forward to the exciting future for this company and the medicines it will advance for patients.”

The others joining Westlake in the funding were Corner Ventures Alexandria Venture Investments and the California Institute of Technology.

Home in Conejo

Markus’ professional background is rooted in the Valley; he served as the vice president of global development at Amgen where he led development for the company’s biosimilar division. He worked for the biotech juggernaut for 13 years witnessing the growth of the region’s life science hub in the region and deciding to settle down within it.

Basing Dantari in Thousand Oaks was for Markus a clear-cut decision.

“There’s every reason to put (Dantari) here and no reason not to in the sense that we have the scientific talent the technology from Caltech and then of course we also have entrepreneurs” Markus said. “We had the funding from Westlake Village BioPartners which is local and happy to keep companies here instead of setting up companies elsewhere.”

Harper will chair Dantari’s board as part of the series A financing. Other directors include Markus Dr. Mark Davis a professor of chemical engineering at Caltech and Atara Biotherapeutics Chief Executive Pascal Touchon.

Atara which is publicly traded and based in Thousand Oaks recently announced that it had entered into a royalty-interest financing agreement worth $31 million with HealthCare Royalty for T-cell immunotherapy Ebvallo in Europe and other territories covered by a commercialization agreement with Pierre Fabre. Atara also announced in December that Director Carol Gallagher will assume the role of chair of board of directors replacing Ron Renaud.

According to Markus Touchon’s experience leading Atara and working in executive-level oncological positions at Novartis will serve Dantari well.

“My goal with having him on our board was having someone else who is a seasoned CEO but is a few years ahead of our own path” Markus said. “So there’s a lot of lessons learned that he could bring to the table as well as the Novartis and business development background.”

Controlled release

Dantari develops targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancers such as breast cancer prostate cancer and other diseases.

The company’s treatment platform allows for a significantly higher drug-antibody ratio as well as a tunable release of chemotherapy. “The two main differences of our lead product is this high capacity where we can put 60 molecules of chemotherapy in each drug conjugate as well as a tuned release where we can choose what that release rate is” Markus said.

Standard antibody drug conjugates do not have controlled release capabilities and top out at eight molecules of chemotherapy.

Ultimately Dantari’s treatment is characterized by chemotherapy that works at a significantly high output while in the tumor. Output is then decreased while outside of the tumor creating fewer side effects for patients as compared with standard chemotherapies.

The company’s lead clinical investigational product is DAN-222 which is being evaluated in the early clinical trial stage for the treatment of metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer.

Dantari’s platform technology originated at Caltech and is based on more than 20 years of research there. In addition it uses standard organic chemistry manufacturing.

“It is research that’s been progressing at Caltech in Mark Davis’s lab of chemical engineering that’s where we licensed the technology for this platform” Markus said. “We licensed it in early 2019 and from there we started a small lab here in Thousand Oaks and hired some scientists and really progressed the technology for this platform.”

One of the company’s initial challenges which came well before it emerged from stealth status was finding lab space to progress the science it licensed. Luckily according to Markus life science real estate developer Alexandria was looking at the Valley.

“They bought a couple of buildings and started converting them on speculation basically to spaces that had the power needs the air handling the purified water all those things you need to run a good lab” Markus said. “Without that we wouldn’t have a place to really start so that was the key ingredient besides having the funding from the venture capital and the technology.”

Wet lab space has been a factor that the Valley region’s life science cluster has had to deal with in recent years because of the increasing number of biotech firms establishing themselves in the area. Markus said that prior to 2019 there was nowhere to go in the Greater Conejo valley Pasadena or West Los Angeles for lab space. He added that wet lab space and life science real estate activity has since been bolstered boding well for companies like Dantari which has a busy year ahead.

“Even though we’ve announced quite good funding that has gotten us to where we are we will be also looking to do some additional financing in 2023 to advance all three of our programs” Markus said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hbGxvZ2VuZS1yZXBsYWNlcy16YWktbGFiLWJvdW5kLXJhZmFlbC1hbWFkby13aXRoLXphY2hhcnktcm9iZXJ0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Allogene replaces Zai Lab-bound Rafael Amado with Zachary Roberts,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hbGxvZ2VuZS1yZXBsYWNlcy16YWktbGFiLWJvdW5kLXJhZmFlbC1hbWFkby13aXRoLXphY2hhcnktcm9iZXJ0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5744EB0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

With a combination of computer vision technology and artificial intelligence Analog Devices (ADI) and Seeing Machines aim to perfect driver and occupant monitoring systems for vehicles (DMS/OMS).

Seeing Machines is contributing its expertise in computer vision and AI while ADI is bringing a dedicated infrared driver for powers up to 100W.

The collaboration combines ADI’s advanced infrared driver and high-speed Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link (GMSL) camera connectivity solutions with the artificial intelligence (AI) of Seeing Machines’ DMS and OMS software which is designed to generate indicators of driver fatigue or distraction by monitoring gaze direction and constancy as well as eyelid movements and evaluating head and body position.

Euro NCAP boosts DMR/OMR developments

The background to the joint work e effort – and the current glut of sensors and components for DMR/OMR systems – is the current version of the General Safety Regulations (GSR) of the European Commission and the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) – these will require DMR/OMR systems to be installed in cars in the future. It is also expected to enable future occupant monitoring functions and a range of options for the placement of cameras in the vehicle interior that were previously not feasible due to issues with energy efficiency functional safety hardware space requirements and image quality.

Semi-autonomous driving systems rely on in-cabin DMS and OMS to detect and address driver fatigue and distraction. These systems must operate in all lighting conditions and require appropriate infrared illumination to ensure the image quality required for real-time eye tracking on a frame-by-frame basis. ADI and Seeing Machines’ combined solution leverages ADI’s industry-first infrared driver for DMS and OMS which can deliver up to 100W of peak power in a compact and feature-rich solution. This enables a non-intrusive smaller camera module in the vehicle cabin.

Seeing Machines’ AI software interprets the signals from the optical hardware monitors and diagnoses the problem and combined with ADAS capabilities enables signals to be output to alert drivers and vehicle occupants as needed.

“Interior monitoring is complex and requires careful integration of infrared illumination image capture data processing and algorithm layers to achieve real-time response” said Yin Wu director of automotive product line management at Analog Devices. “Together with Seeing Machines we are supporting the automotive industry with pragmatic solutions that help reduce collisions and save lives.”

Central Components of joint developments in the DMR/OMR arena are ADI’s MAX25614 IR LED driver and GMSL serializer and deserializer (SerDes) connectivity solutions as well as Seeing Machines’ FOVIO DMS and OMS solutions.

Seeing Machines is supplying human-monitoring software that tracks eye gaze eye lids head pose and body pose from which the driver’s attention is deduced.





ADI is supplying an infra-red lighting power supply and GMSL (gigabit multimedia serial link) camera connectivity.





“The combined solution will readily meet European Commission GSR [general safety regulations] and Euro NCAP [European new car assessment program] requirements” according to ADI which claimed: “It is also conducive to enabling future occupant monitoring features and a range of in-cabin camera placement options previously unworkable due to challenges related to power efficiency functional safety hardware footprint and image quality.”

ADI’s lighting PSU will provide up to 100W(peak) through a MAX25614 IC to infra-red or near-IR illuminators that will allow associated cameras to operate in a variety of ambient lighting conditions. “This allows for a non-intrusive smaller camera module in a vehicle’s cabin” it said. The GMSL interface is a serdes (serialiser-deserialiser).

Soaring interest rates helped push more pension plans into surplus in 2022 offsetting market losses as pensions brace for another volatile year in 2023 according to two reports that measure the funding status of Canadian plans.

Consulting company Mercer Canada Ltd. said its quarterly pension health pulse which tracks the median solvency ratio of nearly 500 Canadian defined benefit (DB) pension plans that are Mercer clients increased to 113 per cent as of Dec. 31 up from 103 per cent at the start of the year.

And professional services firm Aon PLC said the aggregate solvency of DB pension plans of companies in the S&P/TSX Composite Index as measured by its pension risk tracker increased to 100.8 per cent at the end of 2022 up from 96.9 per cent a year earlier.

For DB pension plans the solvency ratio measures the ratio of the plan’s assets to its liabilities which are the estimated cost of paying future benefits earned by members. Plans are deemed to have a surplus if their assets exceed 100 per cent of liabilities or a deficit if they fall short.

At the end of the fourth quarter 79 per cent of plans tracked by Mercer were estimated to be in surplus on a solvency basis and another 12 per cent had ratios between 90 per cent and 100 per cent. Four per cent of plans had solvency ratios between 80 per cent and 90 per cent and 5 per cent were below 80 per cent according to Mercer’s data.

“At least since the 2008 financial crisis this is probably the most plans we’ve seen in decent healthy financial positions” Ben Ukonga principal and leader of Mercer’s Wealth business in Calgary said in an interview.

Canadian debt payments climb at record pace as interest rates rise

The main factor that helped boost solvency levels for many Canadian pension plans in 2022 was the rapid rise in interest rates as central banks tried to beat back surging inflation. The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark rate seven times in 2022 from 0.25 per cent to 4.25 per cent.

Pension plan administrators measure future obligations to pensioners using calculations that discount those liabilities based on current interest rates. When rates rise a plan’s liabilities fall because a higher discount rate is applied in the calculations – the plan doesn’t need to have as much set aside now to cover those obligations.

Last year the boost to solvency ratios from falling liabilities more than offset the negative returns that most pension plans recorded amid volatile financial markets. Pension assets broadly declined in 2022 – Aon found they fell 15.6 per cent – and the fourth quarter was also challenging with December declines in equities after a previous rally.

Looking at the year ahead there are important risks that could cause further headaches for pension plans that manage large investment portfolios. Inflation looks like a key headwind even as it has started to ease from peak levels reached last year. In particular inflation could put pressure on indexed pension plans which pay more generous benefits as inflation rises.

Even at plans that are not inflation-linked pensioner groups could advocate more loudly for cost-of-living adjustments to account for rising prices Mercer predicts.

Geopolitical upheaval stemming from the war in Ukraine surging energy prices in Europe persistent supply chain disruptions and rising recessionary fears could also add to risks facing pension plans’ investments.

“I would expect the same volatility as we saw in 2022” Mr. Ukonga said. “All the issues that existed in 2022 don’t go away when the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1.”

With more plans in surplus and continuing headwinds in markets some pension fund managers could take steps to reduce risk in their portfolios shifting more assets to fixed income – which now offers higher yields – or contracting with insurance companies to buy annuities to pay future benefits.

“You’re sort of locking in some of your surplus” Mr. Ukonga said. “We expect that to continue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW1wbG95ZWViZW5lZml0cy5jby51ay9hdXRvbWF0aW9uLWFpLXJldm9sdXRpb25pc2UtYmVuZWZpdHMtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will automation and AI revolutionise the world of benefits in 2023?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='employeebenefits.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /automation-ai-revolutionise-benefits-2023 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E34A8220>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW1wbG95ZWViZW5lZml0cy5jby51ay9hdXRvbWF0aW9uLWFpLXJldm9sdXRpb25pc2UtYmVuZWZpdHMtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2hyc2VhLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmR1c3RyeS9kYXJ3aW5ib3gtYXBwb2ludHMtcGFudXdhdC1iZW5yb2htYW4tYXMtbWFuYWdpbmctZGlyZWN0b3ItZm9yLXRoYWlsYW5kLzk2Njg4ODk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Darwinbox appoints Panuwat Benrohman as Managing Director for Thailand ETHRWorldSEA,"Industry

Over the eight years of Ducey’s administration which ended Monday Arizona was a national leader in employment statistics ranking fourth in rate of job growth and sixth in total jobs added. In that same time period Arizona witnessed the fastest decline of poverty in the country with nearly 220000 fewer people in poverty since Ducey took office.

Ducey reflected on his accomplishments and focused on the workers and business leaders who helped make that possible. “The engine of our economic growth has always been our people” he said. “Today Arizonans have access to abundant jobs as well as the opportunity to work in good-paying industries with the potential for advancement.”

These industries include high-tech manufacturing in semiconductors advanced battery manufacturing and electric vehicles. In the last year alone Arizona added 15000 manufacturing jobs the fastest growth rate in the country.

The opening of TSMC’s new chip factory in north Phoenix earlier this month was a prime example of Arizona’s leadership in job creation. In attendance were President Joe Biden TSMC Chairman Dr. Mark Liu Apple CEO Tim Cook Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry President and CEO Danny Seiden and many other local and national leaders in business and politics.

TSMC recently announced it would open a second facility nearly tripling its investment in the state from $12 billion to $40 billion. The semiconductor company is now expected to create 4500 jobs which will be supplemented by suppliers such as Applied Materials and KPCT Advanced Chemicals that are seeking to be closer to the new fabs.

“The legacy of this project can’t be understated” Ducey said. “Not only will it create thousands of jobs it has positioned Arizona as a global leader for state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing operations.

Business growth has been another key success of Ducey’s administration with nearly 20000 enterprises added since he became governor. Ducey’s interest in this issue has not faded with him launching Arizona Business One Stop just last month to support entrepreneurs in their ambitions.

Arizona Business One Stop is an online portal that seeks to streamline the process of starting and growing a business in Arizona. The site brings together the work of multiple agencies including the Arizona Corporation Commission and the Arizona Commerce Authority to offer guided checklists cost estimators and an easier application process for new business owners.

Because of investments like these Arizona has performed well on many economic indicators ranking as the 5th best state in the country for hiring workers according to a recent study. In a farewell address Ducey called attention to the progress which Arizona has made since he became governor.

“We are the new epicenter for semiconductors and high-tech manufacturing we streamlined our government and we have the lowest flat tax in the nation” Ducey said. “There’s an old Boy Scout motto: Leave the place better than you found it. Arizona I can say with confidence that together we’ve done just that.”"

During 2022 Aptiv inaugurated three new manufacturing plants that generated more than 6900 new jobs in Mexico. Kevin Clark Chairman and CEO of Aptiv and Arturo Alvarez President of EDS and President of Aptiv Latin America led the visit to the National Palace where they were attended by the President and part of his labor and economic cabinet.

During the meeting Lopez Obrador highlighted Aptiv's global and national leadership in driving the growth of the cities where it operates especially small communities.

""The President appreciated Aptiv's confidence in Mexico the creation of jobs and showed great interest in learning about our work"" Alvarez said.

From 2019 to 2022 Aptiv generated more than 13500 new jobs in its 40 manufacturing plants in 14 states of the Republic. Among its main social impact actions is the reforestation program in the Sierra Tarahumara of Chihuahua to which it allocated a donation of 1.6 million pesos for the planting of 31200 trees with the help of the PIES de la Tierra association which coordinates and employs two indigenous communities in charge of reforestation.

""We had the opportunity to represent Aptiv in a meeting with the President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Aptiv has proudly operated in Mexico for over 43 years. Thank you to the team in Mexico for their contributions in 2022 -- I look forward to more exciting years ahead"" said Kevin Clark Chairman and CEO of Aptiv.

The Irish company is a global technology leader that seeks to solve mobility challenges with safe green and connected solutions; it currently employs more than 77000 people in Mexico.

On October 8 the company started operations of a third manufacturing plant in Nuevo Laredo Tamaulipas generating 2517 new jobs thus becoming the company's sixth manufacturing center in that state. The plant is expected to produce an annual average of 2.47 million parts for the North American market which will be assembled into at least 1.10 million highly electrified vehicles.

On October 5 Aptiv inaugurated its operations in Frontera Coahuila where it will generate 3460 new jobs and double the company's workforce in the state. This new operation which will manufacture low-voltage harnesses for electric cars became the company's fourth manufacturing plant in the state.

On October 4 a second manufacturing plant began operations in Linares with an investment of 14.9 million dollars generating 942 new jobs thus becoming the company's third manufacturing center in Nuevo León.

For Aptiv Mexico has the capacity skills and power to continue strengthening its position as a partner of choice in North America; it is also a spearhead in the transformation of the automotive industry through the development of high technology and currently has 1700 engineers who have developed more than 1100 patents.

Aptiv is also a socially responsible company and gives back to the communities in which it operates with social impact activities that benefited more than 140500 people in 2022 alone through educational ecological health and road safety education programs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvaHl1bmRhaS1pb25pcS01LXJvYm90YXhpLXNlcnZpY2UtbGF1bmNoaW5nLWluLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1pbi1sYXRlLTIwMjMtbGEtaXMtbmV4dC0yMDc2NjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyundai Ioniq 5 Robotaxi Service Launching in Las Vegas in Late 2023 L.A.

“Thank you for your free speech. I’m so glad you have freedom” Matthews the evening’s host said from the stage in an awkward attempt to recognize the protester. “Well that was uncomfy for all of us but we have to fight for everyone’s rights. Thank you for my opener” he moved on back on his feet.

And so set the tone for the evening. Each year in a star-studded ceremony GLAAD gives awards to LGBTQ+ media and bestows two honors: one to a trailblazing LGBTQ+ personality and another to an allied media icon. This year’s recipients were Orville Peck and Jennifer Hudson respectively introduced by Jennifer Lawrence and Laverne Cox.

Popular on Variety

But the GLAAD Media Awards are populated by donors and celebrity advocates. During a charged moment of generational protest over war in the Middle East and the lead-up to an existential election most are too hamstrung by the companies or productions they represent to engage in the political matters which charge the moment. Money not words is how the room votes.

Matthews refreshingly honest summed up the dilemma to Variety before the ceremony began perhaps anticipating some disturbance to his monologue.

“I have to be careful and I’ll tell you honestly: I hate that I have to” he told Variety. “We’re so divided now that I feel like if you state an opinion you alienate half the country.” Matthews in addition to his tenured role as producer and judge on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” is also a newly minted producer and co-host on “The Drew Barrymore Show.”

“Lines have been drawn. Whatever you believe you have to show up” he said with a knowing wince at his generality. “Especially when you have a platform — myself included — you have to be careful and I hate that. But you have to find balance. There are some things I keep to myself and there are some things I can’t. GLAAD is one of them. In my monologue tonight you’ll hear some things I can’t not say.”

Matthews did get out a few jabs: “Since some members of the Supreme Court think it’s okay for them to tell women what to do with their bodies maybe we should tell them what they can do with theirs” he chided at the top of the award show. “Like maybe they can go fuck themselves?”

Lawrence there to introduce and honor her friend Peck also used her introductory speech to hurl a few rousing insults at prominent Republicans albeit ones who matter less these days.

“I love the gay community. In fact I was in love with a homosexual. I tried to convert him for years but now I know conversion therapy doesn’t work” she began. “Did you hear me Mike Pence? I said conversion therapy isn’t real even though I know you think it worked on you” she hurled to a giddy audience. “He’s in New York tonight. He’s receiving a Kid’s Choice Award for weirdest dick.”

Gay and transgender rights have a place in many of the political and social justice issues which confront voters this election cycle. Most guests on Saturday telegraphed what they hoped to say through pursed lips.

“I have to give you my ‘Miss America’ answer” said Sasha Velour a former “RuPaul’s Drag Race” winner and current co-host of HBO’s “We’re Here.” “LGBTQ+ activists have been at the forefront of all social justice movements” she told Variety. “Even now with students organizing to support Gaza it’s queer people who are organizing. We’re part of every community even if we aren’t welcomed.”

Jaida Essence Hall another “Drag Race” winner and “We’re Here” co-host grinned through her teeth: “Gay rights are human rights” she told Variety on the red carpet echoing the famous phrase. “Speaking up for social issues is like a buffet. There’s always room to go back for more. Everyone has a right to live where they are and be where they want to be. Wink wink.”

GLAAD of course is a political organization. While the glitz and glamor is fun — the award show also featured appearances by Uma Thurman Don Lemon and Loren Allred who sang “Never Enough” — the $350000 raised on Saturday evening will primarily support get-out-the-vote initiatives and ad-buying through the election season.

It’s no surprise then that no guest roused louder applause and a hastier standing ovation than New York Attorney General Letitia James who took the stage to introduce GLAAD’s president Sarah Kate Ellis. Clad in a warrior-like evening dress overlaid with chain mail-like accents James lit up the room. In her hands — still glossy with a $355 million bounty from Donald Trump — rested real change the crowd reasoned.

“I love you more” she shouted back at the star-struck audience with her strong New York brogue. “In New York we say gay. We say lesbian. We say bi. We say transgender and we say history” she rallied with a stab at Florida’s infamous “Don’t Say Gay” legislation. “In New York we don’t just say these words. We embody them each and every day and we celebrate the history of everyone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3J0LXdvcnRocy10YWxsZXN0LWJ1aWxkaW5nLXNlbGxzLTExMTc0MjYxNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Worth's tallest building sells for just $12.3M at auction in stunning price drop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3J0LXdvcnRocy10YWxsZXN0LWJ1aWxkaW5nLXNlbGxzLTExMTc0MjYxNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E35DBA30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. from becoming speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday.

Republicans Chip Roy R-Austin Michael Cloud R-Victoria and Keith Self R-McKinney were among 20 hard-line GOP rebels who held the line and voted against McCarthy despite negotiations over rule changes and committee appointments.

The opposition left the lower chamber without a top leader at least until Wednesday when lawmakers will reconvene to vote again.

Before Tuesday it was clear McCarthy didn’t have the 218 votes needed to become speaker after the first round of voting. But Self’s vote came as a surprise since he hadn’t made public his position.

“I’m looking for the man or the woman who will be strong and enforce rules from the top from the leadership” the congressman-elect told The Texas Newsroom on Tuesday evening.

Self voted instead for Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. Jordan himself supports McCarthy.

Self recognized McCarthy’s concession including reinstating the Cut-As-You-Go rule or CUTGO. That rule requires that any mandatory spending increase is matched by a spending cut.

But Self said even that concession seems to have been made to appease conservatives like him and not to actually improve the legislative process.

“Mandatory spending is all of the most important spending in the constituents’ minds and it is very difficult to see how anyone would be able to enforce that” Self said. “So I’m not sure that’s even a reasonable rule.”

Most of the Congress members who voted against McCarthy are part of the House Freedom Caucus an ultra-conservative group of lawmakers. McCarthy made other concessions in order to get enough votes from them to become speaker. He conceded to allow any five Republican lawmakers to initiate a vote of no confidence against the speaker Fox News reported Monday . He also vowed to end remote voting.

Speaking from the House floor on Tuesday afternoon Roy said the vote was “about the future of the country.”

He surprised his colleagues when he voted for Rep. Byron Donalds R-Fla. for speaker once and for Rep. Jordan twice.

Roy said he wanted members to have the ability to offer amendments to legislation from the floor of the House.

“The fact is this place has to change” Roy said. “It has to change and the change comes by either adopting rules and procedures that would make us actually do our jobs or it comes from leadership.”

Tuesday’s vote showed one of the biggest divisions so far within the Republican Party and within the Texas GOP delegation.

Speaking to reporters  Rep. Dan Crenshaw R-Houston slammed the GOP members who voted against McCarthy.

“We will not vote for anyone else but McCarthy — those people think they are stubborn we are more stubborn” Crenshaw said. “They are enemies now.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

While data-driven decision-making is becoming the norm to quickly and effectively address said challenges before they become insurmountable the world of data has reached an inflection point that will only deepen the enterprise-to-data bond.

In the not-too-distant past data users received packaged data reports to analyze and absorb which soon evolved into a generation of self-service. Now data is distributed across an organization and companies prioritize data-sharing organization-wide. Today’s leaders empower data and business users across their organizations to discover and explore trusted data — weaving it into everything they do.

Common Data Challenges

The challenge? Data is stored in siloed environments from the cloud to on-premises making it difficult for producers of data products to understand what exists. The immense amount of data can create bottlenecks and confusion. Furthermore data is spread across wiki pages data dictionaries email chat social and raw web content. These high volumes of data often come with redundancies making it hard for data consumers to fully understand the breadth of what data exists. This hinders a user’s ability to find a single source of truth.

The second challenge is data understandability context and trustworthiness. Very little data within the massive enterprise data sprawl has a description associated owner date of creation intended use/purpose usage stats data quality indicators etc. Finding data is only a fraction of the effort; piecing together the answers to all these contextual questions is the other and is currently done manually using brute force phoning friends and making educated guesses. Understandability context and trustworthiness are challenges shared by all data consumers regardless of whether they are doing self-service using delivered reports or using shared data products.

Lastly organizations struggle to capture associate and share critical knowledge about the data. This data i.e. common term definitions metric definitions KPI definitions and business process/workflow definitions must be shared to increase data literacy and effectively use data in an enterprise.

Enter Data Curation

Let’s revisit the definition of curation that Dave Wells noted writer and expert offered in his 2019 blog. Wells stated that “curation is the work of organizing and managing a collection of things to meet the needs and interests of a specific group of people.” At the time “things” was primarily thought of as datasets and files. Now the scope has broadened with the realization that asset classes that need to be curated also include BI reports/dashboards models metrics terms glossaries domains and much more.

While this covers the “things” to be curated how are they organized and managed? Maintaining metadata attributes for each asset class helps to keep things organized. For instance curated metadata attributes for a column might include a description top users associated queries data quality score last updated data and sensitivity classification. Curated metadata attributes for a BI report may include creation data report owner certification classification update date delivery group/list run schedule etc.

So the first step in modern curation is deciding which asset classes will be curated and what specific attributes will be curated.

The second step is to decide how you will measure the completeness timeliness and accuracy of the curation efforts. This means you must look at each asset class and its attributes to decide what is an acceptable threshold for each.

The third step is to decide who will be responsible for overseeing the curation process. This leads to an interesting set of decisions regarding stewardship types of stewards data curators and crowdsourcing. In general the metadata attributes of each asset class fall into one of three categories: business technical or compliance related. Understanding that is a good starting point for constructing a RACI-style matrix (a responsibility assignment matrix) which shows who will be responsible and accountable for maintaining the curated attributes at or above the target threshold.

Construction of the RACI matrix also allows an organization to think deeply about which attributes can be populated and updated by their data consumer community and which need to be more closely managed by authorized users.

Challenges of Successful Data Curation

Like the issues pushing many companies to data curation curators must overcome challenges. As discussed above getting a handle on the metadata as the volume rises is a significant hurdle to overcome. Additionally the internal pace of change as it moves to a data-forward organization will affect the success of the data curation journey. Especially in times of transition it is important to prioritize data sets and areas of the business to first implement data curation.

The breadth and depth of assets that need to be curated also present challenges for successful data curation. Not only is an immense amount of metadata coming into your organization that needs to be organized but terms metrics queries and more have to be derived and analyzed from all of that metadata. Companies must also consider the depth of those attributes and that each piece needs to be specifically curated to meet varying demands across different sectors within the business.

Last a major challenge of successful data curation is that companies need to be more thoughtful about their implementation approach. Companies want to see the benefits quickly. However they need to think about implementing new processes without disrupting day-to-day business and without making employees feel like they are gaining extra work. The platform must be easy to use and digest to help employees move fast without disrupting work.

Successful Data Curation Requires Bringing Humans and Machines Together

Understanding data is extremely important. But to know what to trust you have to understand the intricacies of the data: how it maps to business processes how recent it is and how it is being used. This requires a balance of machine learning (ML) and human intelligence. Companies can adopt a few key tactics to leverage ML and AI products into their data curation process.

The first tactic is to automate curation assistance to handle the volume of work. This can help with classification naming tracking the popularity and top users of different data sets and prioritizing the correct datasets. Additionally you can use automated stewardship to spread the workload and scale across the entire enterprise.

A successful marriage between the human aspect and ML can help ease the overall transition into a healthy curation management process. With the right mix you can crowdsource curation capture part of asset reuse and collaboration which can help people expedite their current jobs.

AI and ML can be extremely helpful with tracking and governance throughout the entire organization. Automating measurement monitoring and task routing helps to keep track of data and who is making changes to it. Additionally curation process automation via bots can help governance by triggering alerts and notifications to keep employees looped into anything out of place in their datasets.

Curating Data with a Data Catalog

Data catalogs organize all data assets spread across a company’s various systems. A data catalog documents tribal knowledge and best practices by presenting the data in context. The key question is what do you use to manage the curation process and all these data and data-related assets?

For instance with the help of Alation Data Catalog data curators can create a broader awareness of how data can be applied to make informed decisions improving the accuracy of data knowledge in the organization.

By inventorying classifying and curating data and knowledge Alation provides unparalleled visibility into enterprise data assets. In contrast to a time-consuming top-down siloed approach Alation enables organizations to focus their governance efforts on the most critical data assets to have the most significant effect on the business. A data catalog’s value stems from its ability to surface the connections and context around different datasets and Alation Data Catalog allows for connections to almost all data connectors.

The context added by the Alation Data Catalog supports employees’ productivity and increased efficiency. Alation’s platform allows employees to see a dataset’s entire work history and gives them the ability to include notes right next to the data. This also includes automated expert identification pinpoints that route employees to the steward responsible for ensuring that questions are directed to the appropriate person. Those questions and full conversations are also saved in the data so that future employees can quickly search and understand the dataset.

Another key benefit of Alation Data Catalog is the innate ability to help companies improve the overall quality and governance of their programs. The first is more straightforward as the platform automatically scans data and flags potential discrepancies. On the governance side the Alation Data Governance app centrally automates and manages policies workflow stewardship activities and more. The app is complemented by a professional service offering called an Active Data Governance Blueprint.

The importance of data-driven decision-making can’t be understated. As companies continue to grow data curators have the task of finding a needle in a haystack. Implementing these best practices and working with a partner like Alation can help bring order to data. Ultimately investing in data knowledge with a data catalog can inspire data-savvy individuals and promote a data-driven culture where data is the bond that drives business outcomes.

This tight-rope walk is a massive challenge as multi-cloud environments have thousands of layers of code and app sprawl – which creates even more attack surfaces.

Put simply the task of monitoring the flood of security threats is too big for humans to handle. However we have seen the emergence of predictive AI to help reduce the ever-increasing cybersecurity challenges.

One example of how predictive AI can help is its ability to automatically recognize unidentified computers servers and code repositories on a network. Another is how it can monitor the dark web for crucial linguistic patterns exhibited by hackers uploading new threats and immediately notify security personnel.

In this analysis I’ll share more ways predictive AI is being applied in security and some of the initial successes.

Automated Scanning and Security Risk Reporting

Monitoring network security properly requires processing massive amounts of data located across disparate locations which are often unlabeled and unstructured. Imagine the never-ending cycle of trying to collect all this data logically organize it and then analyze it for any potential threats.

Even if you hired a large team to work on this and managed to pull some of the data together you could still miss critical insights and open the door for future vulnerabilities.

Properly configured Predictive AI can automatically monitor categorize and alert cybersecurity teams of potential threats. This allows these teams to harden security policies and mitigate future attacks.

For example Fortinet uses AI to learn of behavioral tactics of threat actors “from earliest stage reconnaissance and weaponization all the way through to the cybercriminal’s ultimate action on objectives.” Fortinet is on Acceleration Economy’s Top 10 shortlist of Cybersecurity Enablers.

Data-Driven Decision-Making and Incident Response

If you aren’t using data to drive your strategic cybersecurity decisions then it’s like trying to find a slightly different needle in a needle stack. Not only would this harm you as you would be making poor decisions from the lack of data but you would also make your company an easy target.

I strongly recommend using predictive analytics as a method to provide you with more data-anchored options and significant insights. Also many of the solutions available today are easily incorporated into third-party services to further safeguard your data.

As an example artificial intelligence can be used throughout a contract management process to not only help standardized practices but spot any anomalies or potential threats from attached files suspicious links or bot intrusion. This approach brings business operations and cybersecurity together to mitigate business risks and security risks.

Enhanced Risk Forecasts

Incorporating predictive AI’s self-learning capabilities into a business’s existing workflow is a highly effective way to discover new abnormalities evaluate the associated risks and generate accurate risk forecasts for the future.

For instance if you’ve recently integrated social media into your customer service processes your predictive AI’s risk-detecting capabilities can help you spot any problems. But it can take things a step further by delivering forecasts on future threats. These insights provide context where you should shift your focus create coaching opportunities and if any additional intervention is needed.

Initial Successes

Microsoft and Google are seeing huge success with their AI-based malware detection phishing campaign measures and information monitoring. For example:

Microsoft’s Cyber Signals program uses AI to analyze trillions of security signals and surfaces the cyberthreat intelligence to drive executive decisions.

Millions of dollars have been invested by federal funding agencies like National Science Foundation to develop cutting-edge AI tools for extracting useful insights from data produced by the dark web.

Final Thoughts

It’s safe to say that AI will continue to be used to as an effective tool to safeguard businesses and vital systems from cyber threats. However I would strongly urge you to create a multi-pronged strategy for security that doesn’t ignore the role of human intelligence.

The only path forward in the fight against sophisticated criminal attacks is to combine the skills of human cyber specialists with those of intelligent machines.

This can help employees receive personalised recommendations.

Employers can also benefit from greater insight around benefit schemes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and greater automation are infiltrating almost every area of business and employee benefits is no exception. It is a trend that is expected to increase this year offering greater personalisation of benefits for employees and providing employers with the information they need to shape strategies.

At its most basic AI can help put benefits in front of employees based on their individual circumstances. Thomas Faith head of product at Zest says: “Employees want relevant and helpful content and they want it to be available when they need it. To that end placing the best content in front of people when they need it is certainly something in which AI can and should have a role.”

This can also mean offering employees the benefits that best suit their needs says Gethin Nadin chief innovation officer at Benefex and Zellis. “Too much choice is confusing” he says. “The more advanced providers will now also allow [employees] to preference themes of topics like money or wellbeing and give [them] a more personalised and tailored benefit scheme. This is heading towards automation not only making that choice easier but also assisting [them] in making choices [they] didn’t know [they] needed.”

Yet there will always be a need for human involvement particularly around financial benefits says Alexis Parrish head of benefits technology at pensions advisory firm Isio. “We know that technology can certainly automate some processes and expect its use to continue to grow but the issue of engagement and connectivity still remains” she says. “Big decisions in life often in relation to personal finances and life circumstances are unlikely to be made without human reassurance.”

Individual experiences

AI and automation can help deliver individuals the kind of experience from employee benefits packages that they receive in their personal lives. Andy Seabrook-Harris technology product director at Aon says: “Viewing employees as online consumers brings new and exciting ways of thinking about employee benefits and automation and AI are the driving force behind meeting those needs. In 2023 and beyond we’ll see more automated data flows personalised recommendations and proactive customer support tools using AI to drive personalisation and automation.”

Developments in 2023 are likely to be modest as technology teams seek to develop best practices and agree common standards. “What’s really exciting however is the potential to bring in content from other technology partners to drive personalised engagement similar to the service we’ve all come to expect from the likes of Netflix or Spotify” adds Seabrook-Harris.

Impact on reward teams

Aside from tailoring suggestions around benefits to employees automation and AI are likely to impact how employee benefits teams operate. This could lead to some tasks and roles such as manual data entry and benefits administration being automated says Marcelo Lebre chief operating officer (COO) at Remote. “By providing data-driven insights and automating administrative work AI and automation tools will help HR teams spend less time on paperwork and more time on the tasks that only humans can perform resulting in stronger teams and greater employee satisfaction.”

Greater automation could also impact on the traditional benefits enrolment window with less manual intervention reducing the need for employees to take out benefits at a particular time of year. Sahil Sethi CEO and co-founder of financial wellbeing platform Maji says: “Benefit enrolment windows will continue to become more flexible. Employers are increasingly moving to quarterly benefit cycles with some even allowing monthly changes for example in changing pension contributions or corporate Isa savings via payroll.”

More automation means more data and this could impact on benefit strategies and delivery. By understanding what benefits work well for particular types of employee based on factors such as gender age industry and region employers can come up with benefit design schemes in seconds. “What used to take hours of research is now available at the click of a button” says Nadin.

Data analysis can also help employers explore the likely impact of any changes ahead of implementation using automation machine learning and AI says Seabrook-Harris. “This can simulate the impact of changing a benefit provision and how that change impacts price and employee perception” he says. “This concept of using data analytics combined with machine learning and AI is a fascinating one that we expect to see more of in the UK.”"

Avery Dennison – as a clothing label and trim supplier to apparel brands - is transforming how we manufacture and manage our supply chains by harnessing the power of data and digital solutions. Even the products we produce for our fashion customers are taking the form of digital solutions which will underpin circularity and sustainability in the years to come.

Data insights for reactive production

Data insights are informing our factories around the world helping us avoid product defects be better prepared for seasonal peaks and be more accurate in our supply chain planning. Because textile waste is such a problem in fashion we have a duty to adopt smart manufacturing processes that will reduce supply chain waste and minimise the resources we and our customers use.

Using forecasts from our customers combined with historical demand data we’re working to improve capacity utilisation and service. In the future we have the potential to apply other factors like weather and macro-economic considerations into models to improve forecast accuracy. It all starts with using data to build predictive models.

Fashion is famously cyclical with two big annual demand spikes – in spring and late autumn. Just ahead of those peaks production ramps up but when outside influences unexpectedly kick in significant inventory waste issues come into play.

For instance if it’s unseasonably warm in September and October the inventory requirement for winter ranges can be reduced dramatically. Rather than be left with unsold goods manufacturing should align more closely to current needs and AI-driven data analytics is proving to be the key to this more accurate timely and sustainable model of production.

All the way through the supply chain fashion suppliers need to respond to demand fluctuations with speed. Our bespoke labels for fashion brands are required to be reconfigured if the inventory mix is altered at late notice. Material composition and wash care instructions might change for thousands of items coming through the supply chain. So we need adaptability powered by digital systems to make those last-minute production adjustments possible.

Product performance testing using data

Historically every heat transfer label Avery Dennison develops is tested across multiple fabric and application combinations. That testing process is lengthy and costly. Through years of following that process we’ve created a mountain of performance testing data. Using that data we’ve recently built a tool based on machine learning to predict the performance of our products under different fabric and application conditions. In the spirit of agile development we started with a small data set and predicted the performance of our products with up to 85 per cent accuracy.

We’re now expanding our data sets to improve that accuracy with the goal of using predictive analytics to eliminate the need for costly physical sampling. That will save thousands of hours of test time and help us realise potentially over $1m in savings.

Industry 4.0 essential for the circular economy

There is growing interest in the fashion sector for IoT-enabling technologies that authenticate product history provide tracking and inventory solutions and support richer consumer encounters. Product information – digital product passports – can be accessed by stakeholders simply by scanning a QR code on a garment’s care label with a smartphone and accessing composition data and care advice stored in the cloud.

The World Economic Forum[1] says the only way to bring about climate neutrality by 2050 is to create a global circular economy. Digitalisation is the lifeblood of this economic model.

Manufacturers are operating today in a world of big data and massive amounts of information so innovations such as intelligent labels provide much-needed transparency showing how a connected world can be a better world full of greater possibilities.

The fashion industry’s aim is for all garments to carry digital product passports that will give customers and textile recyclers vital information. In time clothes recycling will become part of everyday life for us all. Legislation is on the horizon that will fast-track this circular model and help reduce fashion’s unacceptable carbon footprint.

Our intelligent labelling technology which includes QR codes and RFID is already being adopted by fashion brands around the world to start making this a reality. The ‘digital twin’ technology also drives manufacturing and supply chain efficiency improves transparency and enhances product authenticity.

Every manufacturing sector has high hopes that emerging technologies will tackle age-old industrial objectives. These include boosting productivity cutting waste improving quality saving energy and reducing equipment downtime.

Even the largest and most visionary manufacturers still have further to travel on this digital journey. My big hope? That a focus on the intersection of physical product and the digital world and an emphasis on leveraging data to make decisions will help us create compelling solutions that will unlock latent value for us all.

The project is expected to be the world’s largest offshore CCS facility with the capacity to reduce CO 2 emissions by 3.3 million tons per year Baker Hughes said.

To remind Petronas announced the decision to develop the Kasawari CCS project in November 2022.

""Building on its broad experience in liquefied natural gas and offshore technologies Baker Hughes will deliver a state-of-the-art compression solution with minimized footprint and weight as well as a power density allowing for larger flows per unit and best-in-class efficiency. The compressors will be used to enable the transportation and reinjection of the CO 2 separated from natural gas into a depleted offshore field via a subsea pipeline"" Baker Hughes said.

The CCS project is expected to significantly reduce the CO 2 volume currently emitted via flaring of the overall Kasawari gas development supporting PETRONAS’ ambitions to unlock Malaysia’s potential to be a global carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) hub and enable the company to progress towards achieving its own net zero carbon emission targets by 2050 the company said.

“This award demonstrates the viability of significant commercial-scale carbon-capture projects which are critical for the energy transition” said Rod Christie executive vice president of Industrial & Energy Technology at Baker Hughes.

“This project proves that CCS technology can be deployed even in challenging environments including offshore gas facilities and provides an important step forward for reducing emissions from natural gas production.”

Baker Hughes will deliver two trains of low-pressure booster compressors to enable CO 2 removal through membrane separation technology as well as two trains for reinjecting the separated CO 2 into a dedicated storage site.

The trains which will be fitted with PGT25+ and PGT25 gas turbines with Dry Low Emission technology offer greater fuel efficiency and reduced nitrogen oxides emissions even with high CO 2 content fuel gas Baker Hughes added.

The compressors’ casing also enables a reduced footprint compared to other standard solutions a key differentiator in an offshore environment Baker Hughes added.

The financial details of the contract were not disclosed.

The project is expected to be the world’s largest offshore CCS facility with capacity to reduce CO2 emissions by 3.3 million tons per annum (MTPA).

Carbon capture and storage is considered a key component for reducing carbon emissions from industrial sources.

The Baker Hughes compressors will be used to allow the transportation and re-injection of the CO2 separated from natural gas into a depleted offshore field via a subsea pipeline—significantly reducing the amount of CO2 emitted via flaring from the Kasawari gas development.

“This award demonstrates the viability of significant commercial-scale carbon-capture projects which are critical for the energy transition” said Rod Christie executive vice president of Industrial & Energy Technology at Baker Hughes. “This project proves that CCS technology can be deployed even in challenging environments including offshore gas facilities and provides an important step forward for reducing emissions from natural gas production.”

Malaysian national oil and gas company Petronas says the CCS project will help it establish Malaysia as a global carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) hub. A final investment decision on the project was approved in October.

Baker Hughes says it will deliver two trains of low-pressure booster compressors that will use membrane separation technology remove CO2 as well as two trains for re-injecting the separated CO2 into a dedicated storage site.

The trains will be fitted with PGT25+ and PGT25 gas turbines with Dry Low Emission technology for greater fuel efficiency and reduced nitrogen oxides emissions even with high CO2 content fuel gas. The compressors’ casing will also help to reduce the footprint compared to other standard solutions.

The Kasawari development is a greenfield project located in the Malaysian sector of the South China Sea with an estimated trillion cubic feet (tcf) of recoverable gas resources. It’s being developed and operated by Petronas Carigali a wholly-owned subsidiary Petronas.

The Krewe will showcase the crowning of a new King and Queen and their 2023 court of debutantes during the ball on Saturday Jan. 7. The Krewe will also celebrate its yearly accomplishments.

“The ball is basically a party so there is drink food and entertainment where members enjoy a night out” said Wayne Kraemer a founder of the Krewe of Okeanos. “At 9 p.m. the King and Queen are presented followed by the Debutantes and their Dukes. The debutantes do a father daughter dance and then there is the Grand March where all Ball attendees march up to the King and Queen to bow pay their respects and offer congratulations. Then more food and drink and dancing.”

The Mistick Krewe of Okeanos is an assumed name for Texas Council for Music and the Arts Inc. a Texas 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation. The Krewe’s mission is to support the music and arts in its locality and bring neighbors together.

The Krewe first came together when Kraemer Rodney van Oudekerke Greg Wurzbach Tom Bond and James and Diana Baker chose to bring a Louisiana Mardi Gras celebration with a Texas twist to San Marcos the group said. The Krewe has hosted 10 Carnival balls and nine parades since its inception.

Kraemer who is the Krewe’s reigning King said the royalty are members of the Krewe who have proved significant impact on the community.

“The King and Queen reign over all of the Krewe’s official functions including the ball the parade and our annual brunch” Kraemer said. “In addition they represent the Krewe at other civic and cultural events. They are nominated by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of Krewe members and the Board also selects the King and Queen.”

The Krewe said Elizabeth Ann Scull Emma Kay Scull Megan Nicole Peters-Stich Brighton Lee Koenig and Madeline Victoria Huebner will be making their debut during the 2023 Carnival Ball.

“Modern debutante balls celebrate outstanding young women as they enter adulthood and society” Kraemer said. “There is also a focus on the civic and academic accomplishments of the girls being presented.”

The upcoming ball is invitation-only but leads up to the Krewe’s annual Mardi Gras parade which will take place on Saturday Feb. 18 at 12 p.m. The parade features floats and bands traversing the streets of San Marcos’ historic districts.

While some predicted the landscape would result in increased costs of canned beer for consumers beer on draft and in bottles actually recorded the largest price increases – at least in the on-premise channel – according to Untappd Insights a Next Glass data firm.

Untappd analyzed menu pricing data from nearly 20000 retailers between March 2022 and December 2022. Across all U.S. retailers the average price of American light lager (per 16 oz. draft) increased +3.3% in the period to $4.94 – while 12 oz. bottles of the style increased +3.4% to $3.91. American IPA on draft increased +1.9% from an average price of $6.75 per 16 oz. to $6.88 while 12 oz. bottles increased +3.7% from $3.83 to $3.97.

Meanwhile the average price of a 12 oz. can of American light lager at on-premise retailers increased +0.9% in the period to $3.35 and American IPAs remained flat at $3.34.

The “no-to-slight increase” in price for 12 oz. can offerings is a reflection of “the reduction in the cost of aluminum” according to Next Glass CEO Trace Smith. In March aluminum futures were at an “all-time high” – spiked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – averaging $4100/ton according to the Untappd report. As of December aluminum was down to about $2400/ton.

IPAs recorded the largest daft price increases at brewery taphouses (+2.9%) – averaging $6.64/16 oz. draft – followed by bars (+2.5%) beer bars/beer gardens (+2.4%) and restaurants (+1.8%). Still taphouses recorded the cheapest price for IPAs with an average of $6.64 per 16 oz. pour. Beer bars recorded the highest average price at $7.19 followed by bars ($6.97) and restaurants ($6.96).

“Brewery taprooms have seen solid price increases across three styles we examined and promisingly taprooms were able to command the highest increase of any category for the most popular craft substyle American IPA” Smith wrote in the report. “Across all venue types however the lower priced American light lager saw the largest price increase on a percentage basis.”

Lagers recorded the largest increase at beer bars/beer gardens (+3.6%) – the venue that already had the second highest lager prices averaging $5.53 per 16 oz. pour – followed by bars (3.4%) restaurants (+3%) and taphouses (+2.7%). Taphouses recorded the highest average price for the style at $5.65 per 16 oz. pour followed by restaurants ($4.87) and bars ($4.86).

Similarly the price of fruit beers increased the most at beer bars/beer gardens (+3.1%) followed by bars (+2.7%) restaurants and taphouses (both +2.5%). Beer bars recorded the highest average price for the style ($6.74) followed by restaurants ($6.61) bars ($6.56) and brewery taphouses ($6.45). The average draft price of fruit beers across all venues increased +2.2% to $6.51 per 16 oz. pour.

“Driving the price increase for the average American light lager substyle were the three most popular American light lagers among the Untappd app user and Untappd for Business communities – Bud Light Miller Lite and Coors Light” Smith wrote.

The average draft price of Bud Light (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) across on-premise venues increased +2.7% in the period to $4.23 while Molson Coors-owned Miller Lite (Molson Coors) increased +2.9% to $4.28 and Coors Light increased +2.4% to $4.35.

Price increases for the top three light lagers were steeper at restaurants than any of Untappd’s other observed “retail categories” (restaurants bars entertainment venues brewery taphouses hotels etc.): Bud Light +3.4% Miller Lite +3.4% and Coors Light +2.7%.

“I suspect increased labor costs which are generally higher in restaurants relative to other retail categories factored into the above average price increases of these popular products – something has to pay the bills!” Smith wrote.

In an aside Smith noted that price increases for A-B’s craft brands – which include Elysian Golden Road Goose Island and Breckridge among others – “significantly outpaced beers of the same style from independent breweries.” The largest discrepancy reported was Breckenridge’s Vanilla Porter which increased price +15.3% on average across Colorado venues to $6.33 per 16 oz. draft pour compared to the overall American porter styles increasing +4.9% to $6.61 in the state. The one exception was Wicked Weed Brewing’s Pernicious IPA which increased its average draft price in its home state of North Carolina +0.2% to $6.55 while the American IPA styles increased +2.3% to an average $6.59/16 oz. in the state.

“I’ve spoken with a number of independent brewers that were unsure about taking price increases in 2022 (some macro producers took two price increases)” Smith wrote. “It appears based on the pricing data we see from beers coming out of A-B InBev’s craft unit that there is ample headroom for smaller producers to take more price in 2023.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9TYW5mb3JkLUNvbW11bml0eS1QYXJrLXVwZGF0ZS0xNzY4NjEwNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sanford achieves $3.6 million funding for Community Park,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Sanford-Community-Park-update-17686107.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9TYW5mb3JkLUNvbW11bml0eS1QYXJrLXVwZGF0ZS0xNzY4NjEwNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGNoZXN0ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9lY29ub21pYy1mb3JlY2FzdC_SAUNodHRwczovL3dlc3RjaGVzdGVybWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2xpZmUtc3R5bGUvZWNvbm9taWMtZm9yZWNhc3QvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taking a Look at Westchester’s Economic Forecast in 2023,"Courtesy of stock.adobe.com

Local industry leaders are celebrating numerous signs of a true economic recovery over the past year…and looking forward to an even better 2023.

By Bill Cary and Elaine Pofeldt

Manufacturing

While pandemic-related supply-chain issues have mostly resolved themselves in many industries some local manufacturers continue to be hit hard by difficulties in getting the materials they need.

“The supply chain has become an exorbitant part of our business” says Oliver Stauffer CEO of Hawthorne-based PTI (Packaging Technologies & Inspection) which has 70 employees who focus on package integrity and seal-quality assurance for the healthcare industry. “A year ago we were ahead of it and we had lots of inventory.”

Today what PTI produces may have 40 or 50 unique parts. “If one of those is missing we can’t ship the product” Stauffer notes. “All it takes is one part to be missing. Getting electronic components is really problematic. We manufacture leak-detection systems for the healthcare industry and develop sensory technologies.”

Price gouging has also become a problem he says. “It may take eight months to get a product and then at double the price. It’s a unique scary environment and it hasn’t gotten better.”

For Don Vibbert CEO of Elmsford-based Image-Works supply-chain issues have definitely gotten better. “We got hit hard on the microchip front and now we’ve gotten a lot smarter about how to manage it so that our customers don’t feel it as much” says Vibbert whose company provides imaging devices and solutions for dental and medical offices. “We have global manufacturers we partner with. We have our own software platforms and then we configure them for the North American market.”

Vibbert adds that the past couple of years have not been easy ones. “It’s definitely been a wild ride to say the least. First COVID hit then the world shut down. Yes 2021 was our best year ever but then Russia invaded Ukraine and the stock market crashed. Many of our clients are dental professionals who own their businesses and most of them have stock portfolios. When the market tanks they definitely get more conservative about spending money.”

But despite these global challenges things are looking up for Vibbert. “We’re optimistic for 2023” he adds. “We’re seeing signs that our customer base has gotten more optimistic as well.”

Bill Taubner president of Ball Chain Manufacturing in Mount Vernon the world’s largest manufacturer of ball-chain and related accessories has also seen some lingering supply-chain issues. “At times it has been difficult to secure flat metal stock from suppliers and prices are skyrocketing due to inflation” Taubner says. “We keep inventory levels high to help ensure production remains constant and that our customers have the products they need.”

The family-owned company was founded in 1938 and now employs more than 80 people. Its many products are used in ceiling fans toilets handbags keychains curtains and U.S. military dog-tag IDs.

“The COVID-19 pandemic was a true challenge” Taubner says. “During the crisis at the request of Michael Romita president of the Westchester County Association we pivoted our business to help address the critical shortage of PPE by launching Bona Fide Masks which makes and distributes KN95 masks and related products.”

And like many manufacturers who were forced to pivot Ball Chain remains committed to staying in the county. “My father and grandfather made a decision years ago to keep our operation local” notes Taubner “My brothers Val and Jim and I feel fortunate that as of today we’ve been able to honor that commitment.”

Commercial Real Estate

After two very strong years local real estate experts say we are poised for another one. “I’m very optimistic” says Paul Adler chief strategy officer at Rand Commercial. “We expect business to increase quarter over quarter in 2023. The Westchester market is still the most desirable market outside of New York City and in the state of New York.”

A lot of growth can be traced back to the residential sector. “Commercial always follows residential growth and the residential market in Westchester is hotter than the sun” Adler says. “That’s why we’ve just had such a great year in 2022 and why we believe 2023 will be a great year. We’re still in the wake of that hot residential market which will come roaring back when interest rates stabilize.”

“The pipeline is healthy going into the first quarter of 2023 but it’s hard to say beyond that. The interest-rate environment obviously is a big deal now and we’re seeing some developers pumping their brakes a little bit.”

—Tom LaPerch Director Houlihan Lawrence Commercial

Compared to pre-pandemic days pricing in the retail market is down slightly but there is still strong demand and limited inventory he says. “It’s not like anybody is going to build a new shopping center.” Interestingly some of the former mall and big-box spaces are seeing new tenants including nonprofits medical facilities and what he described as “experiential retail things like fitness and indoor sports and the like.”

Tom LaPerch director of Houlihan Lawrence Commercial in Rye Brook agrees. “Retail has rebounded very nicely and rental rates have stabilized” he says. “People are tired of buying stuff online. It’s a touchy-feely thing.”

Restaurants and the hospitality sector are also “coming back in a big way” LaPerch adds. “The restaurant market is a very healthy sector now.”

“I thought hospitality would be the last sector to make a comeback but it is back with a vengeance” notes Adler. “Restaurateurs are capitalizing on the fact that people want to go out and be with other people and have that dining experience.”

They are no longer just setting up tables with white tablecloths and leaving it at that he says. “Today’s hospitality provider is much more savvy and everything is fashioned to being multidimensional.”

Overall LaPerch is more cautious about commercial real estate in the coming year. “The pipeline is healthy going into the first quarter of 2023 but it’s hard to say beyond that” he says. “The interest-rate environment obviously is a big deal now and we’re seeing some developers pumping their brakes a little bit.”

The numbers of new developments have changed drastically based on the cost of capital he says. “We’ve lost a couple of deals already. When they got their approvals money was cheap. We’re not sure what their Plan B will be so there are definitely some challenges ahead.”

“Overall office is back” LaPerch says especially Class A office. During the pandemic building owners took the opportunity to “freshen things up” and “put money into their buildings to get people to come back in. We’re seeing parking lots full again.”

For Westchester to remain a dynamic market there needs to be a “sophisticated zoning regimen that reflects the mix people want” adds LaPerch. People want rentals and they want walkability near a transportation hub. “Our downtowns are being reimagined and our older buildings are being reimagined.”

The county’s industrial sector is also performing well particularly “that last-mile e-commerce market” Adler says. Buyers want modern and green spaces with solar panels LED lighting heat-pump systems easy access to transportation a loading dock and high ceilings being prominent desired features. “There is a big difference between a 13-foot ceiling and a 35-foot one” he adds.

Higher Education

Coming on the heels of its remarkable success at reaching new audiences with its wide array of remote and online courses during the pandemic SUNY Westchester Community College (WCC) is increasing its outreach to adult learners many of whom are pursuing training and certifications that lead to higher-paying middle-skill jobs according to college president Dr. Belinda Miles. “Online courses allowed us to reach new markets including adult learners who might be juggling busy work schedules and childcare needs and cannot easily spend the time commuting to campus.”

In order to help address the needs of the business community and support the region’s economic growth WCC has developed or revised programs in Advanced Manufacturing Information Technology Health Studies and more. The Valhalla-based community college recently partnered with Port Chester Ossining and Peekskill high schools to provide automatic admission for qualified seniors and the college is looking to expand the program with additional school districts in the county in 2023. WCC also recently opened a new state-of-the-art facility at the Cross County Center in Yonkers that is triple the size of its previous Extension Center with computer and science labs and a full array of student services.

Over the past three years the graduation rate of WCC students has increased by 45% Miles says. “This trend is due to several factors including programs designed to assist students who require increased support in their post-secondary education.”

In January the newly named Iona University will officially open the flagship building of the NewYork-Presbyterian Iona School of Health Sciences at its 28-acre Bronxville campus (formerly Concordia College) as the Kelly Center for Health Sciences named after benefactors Alfred F. Kelly Jr. and Peggy Kelly. The nearly 32000-square-foot building spans three floors and features state-of-the-art equipment spaces and amenities according to Dr. Seamus Carey president of the New Rochelle university. Notably the entire top floor is dedicated to recreating a hospital setting with simulation labs exam rooms and training equipment.

“We also will utilize the new campus for athletics club sports performing arts and other student activities as we grow into the new space” Carey says. Currently the most sought-after Health Science program is Iona’s Bachelor of Science degree in nursing which offers both a traditional four-year bachelor’s degree as well as an accelerated degree for those who already have a bachelor’s in another field but want to make a career change. Outside of the classroom Iona is adding women’s acrobatics and tumbling and men’s lacrosse as the school’s 22nd and 23rd intercollegiate sports.

Pace University is adding new undergraduate and graduate programs in such areas as information technology healthcare business and law that respond to market demands and the university is providing more flexibility in how coursework is delivered according to Pace president Marvin Krislov.

Enrollment is up across Pace campuses with a 17% increase in graduate students an 18% increase in international students and 7% growth at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law which once again was named by U.S. News & World Report as the No. 1 environmental law program in the country.

“Across our campuses and at Pleasantville in particular we are making significant investments in our science labs and our healthcare simulation labs … to help address a critical need in the region for more clinical lab technicians and nurses” Krislov says.

Also in 2023 Pace expects to complete its Pace University Cyber Range a controlled interactive technology environment for cybersecurity education. In the fall the university will open a new 26-story residence hall and academic building in New York City.

Following the retirement of college president Dr. Michael Geisler Manhattanville College will be seeking a new leader this year. The Purchase-based college began its fall 2022 semester with one of the largest increases in new student enrollment in its recent history according to interim president Louise Feroe. College enrollment for new first-year students is up 40%.

“Across our campuses and at Pleasantville in particular we are making significant investments in our science labs and our healthcare simulation labs.”

—Marvin Krislov President Pace University

Manhattanville will renovate its main athletics center Kennedy Gymnasium to include additional gym space for a growing program in physical education this year. The college will also add new meeting space in the library for commuter students to study and gather and it will continue to expand its School of Nursing and Health Sciences which opened in 2020.

Manhattanville like many colleges nationwide is at an inflection point Feroe says. “Our world has been profoundly affected by the pandemic and not unexpectedly there has been financial and interpersonal fallout for higher-education institutions.” Like many liberal-arts schools the college has seen a shift in the type of student it is attracting resulting in fewer international students and a decline in traditional residential students. “But the college has been able to increase enrollment by offering more career-oriented programs and programs for nontraditional students as well as launching online offerings” concludes Feroe.

Healthcare

The aftereffects of the pandemic have had a big impact on healthcare planning in Westchester. Patients who are finally seeking postponed medical treatment are now coping with problems that didn’t get caught early and turning to locally based providers for increasingly advanced care and outpatient services.

Across the Westchester Medical Center Health Network (WMCHealth) Josh Ratner executive vice president and chief strategy officer says the patient population includes a rising number of patients who have arrived there sicker than before the pandemic with the average patient stay increasing by 10% between 2019 and 2021. “It could be that they were avoiding preventive care or they waited” Ratner says. “They were scared to go to the doctor. As things progressed they got more severe.”

Many of these patients are moving from inpatient to outpatient care after discharge so they can get ongoing follow-up. “Sicker patients require higher levels of care” says Ratner.

The number of patients being transferred by ambulance or helicopter to WMCHealth is also up by 40% since 2017 Ratner adds. To address the needs of this new surge of patients WMC established a new critical care tower with private rooms for patients. WMCHealth is preparing for 5.5% growth in the patient population through 2027 driven in part by migration to the suburbs. It is expecting growth of more than 25% in patients ages 65 and up and a 7.3% uptick in patients ages 18 to 34 Ratner says.

White Plains Hospital continues to expand access to high-quality care close to home according to its executive vice president and chief medical officer Dr. Michael Palumbo. One example is the cardiac surgery program it launched in late 2021 with Montefiore Einstein. “Cardiac surgery can be stressful not only for patients but for their loved ones too” says Palumbo. “Being able to have this world-class program in Westchester County has been remarkable for our patients and our clinical outcomes in 2022 far exceeded national quality and performance metrics.”

Beyond this the hospital opened a state-of-the-art intensive care unit (ICU) in August 2022 and will soon be launching a neurointerventional surgery program that will offer the most advanced stroke treatment procedures currently available. The hospital is also investing in the WPH Cares program which offers patients support after discharge so they can recover effectively or manage their chronic diseases at home. WPH Cares offers remote patient monitoring access to a clinical pharmacist and if needed home visits by a paramedic to provide patients with necessary treatments.

“In the past few years this care model has proven successful for patients with complex needs such as those with COPD and we are working to expand these services to more patients in 2023” says Palumbo.

Meanwhile New York Presbyterian-Lawrence Hospital has been renamed New York Presbyterian-Westchester to reflect its commitment to community care. “As we’re coming through COVID it’s a way for us to renew our commitment to exceptional care” says Paul Dunphey senior vice president and chief operating officer.

The hospital system purchased the WestPark office complex for $83.5 million in March with plans to establish a new ambulatory care outpatient facility that will bring access to clinical teams from ColumbiaDoctors. The location will offer Centers of Excellence in areas such as women’s health cancer care and neuroscience. It has also expanded its spine program known as a national leader in the space and opened a new 6045-square-foot facility at the site of the former Pier 1 store in Larchmont at 1329 West Boston Post Road.

“It could be that they were avoiding preventive care or they waited. They were scared to go to the doctor. As things progressed they got more severe.”

—Josh Ratner Executive Vice president and Chief Strategy Officer WMCHealth

Amid industry-wide staffing shortages all three healthcare systems have prioritized talent recruiting and retention with NewYork-Presbyterian partnering with Iona University School of Health Sciences; WMCHealth teaming up with Pace University and New York Medical College; and White Plains Hospital partnering with Mercy College to develop their talent pipelines. White Plains Hospital offers an “Earn While You Learn” program in which full-time hospital employees can return to school to earn certifications for hard-to-fill positions. “Our greatest asset is our staff and we work continually to find ways to invest in their growth and development” says Palumbo.

Banking

Westchester County’s banking sector is bracing for a slowing economy. “I would say to people for 2023 to be prepared for some difficult economic times” says John Tolomer market vice president and executive vice president at Valley Bank which acquired The Westchester Bank in 2021. “Avoid taking undue risk. The slowdown is here.”

With higher borrowing costs for commercial mortgages Tolomer is recommending that local businesses reduce any unnecessary costs. The county is home to 27684 job-creating firms and 104393 non-employer establishments according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

“When you see Meta and Amazon reducing their workforces you know there is going to be some difficulty ahead. Small and midsize businesses should prepare for that.”

—John Tolomer Market Vice President and Executive Vice President Valley Bank

“When you see Meta and Amazon reducing their workforces you know there is going to be some difficulty ahead. Small and midsize businesses should prepare for that” Tolomer says. “I think for small-business owners that have been able to navigate the last couple of years what is in front of us won’t pose any more challenge than they’ve come through already. If they’ve been strong enough to survive the last few years they will be just fine.”

As a result of their merger with The Westchester Bank Valley Bank is now a $55 billion institution. “We are always looking to build our business” says Tolomer. “We have a very strong balance sheet. We have been prudently aggressive in terms of loans from a consumer standpoint and an SMB perspective. We believe we are well positioned to assist the consumer in Westchester as well as the business community. Since our merger with Valley we’ve been able to increase our ability to help businesses get the financing they need and will continue to do that.”

Despite the challenges there are some positive developments that will influence the economic environment in which banks operate. County Executive George Latimer recently unveiled a $2.3 billion budget that will not increase the county’s tax levy. Because of high inflation the county is seeing sales-tax revenue that is at a record high.

Beyond that jobs in the county are plentiful at least for now. “Overall our unemployment rate is 2.3 percent lower than it was before COVID” notes Bridget Gibbons director of the county’s Office of Economic Development. “We have strong growth across almost all of our sectors. We are very optimistic about the county’s ability to weather a recession.”

Retail

Westchester’s malls and downtowns are seeing the effects of pent-up demand and new stores have been springing up around the county.

“In-person shopping is definitely the trend for 2023 and beyond says Bridget Gibbons director of the county’s Office of Economic Development. “During the pandemic we all shopped online and even local businesses added online ordering to their websites. Westchester County offered free services to help companies that didn’t have an e-commerce component on their websites to add one. Now we’re seeing people are finally comfortable going back to boutiques and restaurants.”

Retail occupancy has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels with the availability rate at 6% to 6.5% according to Sarah Jones-Maturo president of the commercial real estate firm RM Friedland. “Availability is now at a healthy spot” says Jones-Maturo. The lowest availability is in Southern Westchester.

However pricing has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. “We think that was lack of confidence on the side of ownership rather than a true indicator of where the market is today” says Jones-Maturo. The average asking price is $35.66 [per square foot].

Off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx and Target have been very active in Westchester says Jones-Maturo. “They didn’t have much of a downturn. They continue to be strong and active.”

As a result spaces suitable for big-box retail have been in demand. Port Chester has the highest availability rate and demand has been high for the largest blocks of space in the Waterfront Shopping Center according to RM Friedland’s research.

“There is tremendous demand for some of the larger blocks of space that came on the market recently some of which was left behind by Bed Bath & Beyond which closed locations” says Jones-Maturo. “We expect they will be leased in the coming months.”

“In-person shopping is definitely the trend for 2023 and beyond.”

—Bridget Gibbons Director Westchester County Office of Economic Development

Some of the most significant transactions for Q3 included Wren Kitchens’ lease at the Yonkers Gateway Center in the former location of Pier 1 Imports and the Genesis Auto Dealership which took over what was once the Lazy Boy shop on Central Avenue in Scarsdale according to RM Friedland’s market report.

Experiential retail — including trampoline parks boutique fitness and pickleball — are making a comeback the firm found. “Those users are active in the market again” says Jones-Maturo. However there is still room for growth. Restaurants for example were far more active than in the pandemic but have now been weighed down by high food prices and the labor shortage.

The Arts

“I’m cautiously optimistic about 2023” says Janet Langsam longtime CEO of ArtsWestchester in White Plains. “I think things have eased and we’ve turned a corner. The arts had a difficult time with COVID but we’ve seen some sold-out events recently and that gives me a lot of hope. Arts organizations are trying really hard to ease the concerns of the public.” Timed tickets reservations markings on floors to separate people and new air-quality systems are legacies of the pandemic. “People are being really selective about what they go to but they’re going” she says.

The Jacob Burns Film Center (JBFC) which recently announced the hiring of film industry veteran Ryan Harrington as its new programming director was planning on launching an overhaul of its three original ground-floor auditoriums in February. Look forward to new seats layouts and flooring more legroom and better access and comfort. The third-floor gallery of the Pleasantville film center will get new bar space and casual seating.

“Our goal for 2023 is to reach our average audience engagement at the pre-pandemic level” says JBFC executive director Mary Jo Ziesel. The theater’s masked matinees at select screenings will continue. “The pandemic taught us the importance of watching discussing laughing crying and celebrating with loved ones and strangers — together.”

Early this year the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers will celebrate the opening of its new 12000-square-foot west wing with inaugural exhibitions on “humanity’s interconnectedness and our relationship to the river” says director and CEO Masha Turchinsky. Along with new exhibition galleries with great river views and a dedicated sculpture court the wing will include a new Community and Partnership Gallery for emerging artists and community collaborations. The museum is also completing construction of a new 100-seat ADA-compliant auditorium.

While the pandemic has still kept visitorship rates below 2019 levels “we not only increased our digital footprint to meet audiences where they were when they needed it; we also grasped that our communities rely on us as a convener and catalyst for many important topics” Turchinsky says.

To protect its actors and theatergoers the White Plains Performing Arts Center (WPPAC) has installed a brand-new air purification system into all five of its HVAC units. Using state-of-the-art technology from Global Plasma Solutions the system filters out not only harmful pathogens but also adds ionization purifiers to clean the air before it re-enters the venue says WPPAC general manager Kathleen Davisson. “GPS ionization permanently reduces or eliminates the indoor air of particulates pathogens mold spores and viruses” Davisson notes.

“We not only increased our digital footprint to meet audiences where they were when they needed it; we also grasped that our communities rely on us as a convener and catalyst for many important topics.”

—Masha Turchinsky Director and CEO Hudson River Museum

As far as any lingering pandemic issues “sponsorships have been difficult to secure but other than that we have recovered pretty well” she says. “Attendance has been great.”

During the pandemic ArtsWestchester got $1 million from the state legislature Langsam says. “We got that money out quickly to affiliates in grants between $5000 and $25000. It was very needed very necessary. We’re thrilled to get another $1 million for 2023” she says. “This time we’re trying to get it out to some of the more local groups.”

Every five years ArtsWestchester does an economic development study; the next is set for 2023. The previous one reported a $172 million economic impact from the arts annually and that the arts are responsible for 5000 jobs in the county Langsam says. “I would be thrilled if we do as well as the last one; I’d be ecstatic if we did better.”

Residential Real Estate

Prices for residential homes in Westchester County are holding steady even in an atmosphere of higher interest rates — and that trend is likely to shape 2023.

“Even though our supply is down and the buyer’s demand is down we are still in a market that is supporting price” says broker Mary Stetson founder of Stetson Real Estate in Mamaroneck. “Even with the interest-rate changes the supply has been constrained and will be constrained. There will be fewer people who will choose to move and give up their low interest rates. Most people who want to refinance already have.”

“Whatever town was perceived to have high test scores has been sought-after more. Now we’re seeing the demand spread out. People are going to where they can afford.”

—Mary Stetson Founder Stetson Real Estate

Data shows the market is slowing a bit. As of October there were 1200 homes on the market in the county down from 1348 last year according to Stetson. The median listed price in October was $795000 down .5% since September. Listings spent eight days more on the market in October 2022 than in September 2022 and October 2022 saw the sale of 477 homes down from 567 in October 2021.

However the median sale price for homes in Westchester over the last 12 months was $645312 as of October 2022 up 1.6% since last year according to Rocket Homes.

Stetson says that with interest rates higher purchasers’ buying power is down so they are looking at houses in lower price points than before. “People who might have been prequalified before at $1.2 million might be looking at $800000 now” she says.

Against this backdrop demand for houses in every community in the county has been high according to Stetson. “Traditionally Rye was really sought-after or Larchmont or Chappaqua” says Stetson. “Whatever town was perceived to have high test scores has been sought-after more. Now we’re seeing the demand spread out. People are going to where they can afford.”

Regardless of the community where they are shopping many potential buyers are looking for single-family and larger homes Stetson says. “Places with their own front doors will be dramatically more popular than places within buildings” she says. “That’s a holdover from COVID.”

Also popular are houses with backyard amenities such as pools and home offices. “With people working from home they want two home offices” she says. “They want a door and some Sheetrock between two people’s conversations.”

Since the Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 momentum in energy-transition financing has been slow. Despite numerous net-zero commitments and the ongoing growth of the sustainable-investment industry energy-transition investments remain less than 1% of the $130 trillion available for sustainable financing according to Citibank research.

The need to mobilize capital for this transition was in stark focus at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Egypt. Among the delegates was Karen Fang managing director and global head of Sustainable Finance at Bank of America (BofA) whose key takeaway was the high engagement level of the private sector.

“I think the extent of that commitment had previously been underestimated” she says. “The private sector is certainly a willing and vital participant at the table.”

A passionate climate advocate Fang says the question is how the private sector can engage to scale capital to what was calculated in 2021 by the World Resources Institute a US-based think tank to be a $3 trillion to $5 trillion annual bill for funding climate change measures—with $1 trillion per year needed in emerging markets alone.

Reflecting on some of the climate commitments made to date as part of the wider COP agenda Sasha Cook head of Investment Banking for the Western Cape and sustainable finance executive at Standard Bank in South Africa believes those commitments should really be considered the bare minimum.

“What came out of COP27 was the need for action and innovation and for different thinking when looking at how the energy transition is going to be financed—whether that’s blended finance including debt for environment swaps or scaling up very early-stage initiatives” Cook says.

Standard Bank’s climate policy includes a commitment to mobilize 250 to 300 billion South African rand (about $14.4 to $17.3 billion) in sustainable finance by the end of 2026 with a specific commitment of 50 billion rand in climate financing over the next three years and to underwrite an additional 15 billion for renewable-energy power plant financing by the end of 2024.

Standard’s recent funding of the Scatec project in South Africa’s is one such example. With a project cost of 18 billion rand this sizeable solar project brings an additional 540 megawatts of clean energy to the grid in South Africa. Separately SOLA Group’s two solar photovoltaic projects will supply electricity to five facilities of African mining company Tronox Mineral Sands in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. And in November the bank financed a wind-powered renewable-energy plant for EDF Renewables.

In addition to direct project-financing support the bank is now engaging daily with corporate clients’ sustainability plans—a key focus of which is emissions reduction. “We have put in place sustainability linked facilities with several clients across a spectrum of sectors whereby we embed certain sustainability KPIs—and in this instance there is a real focus on renewable energy or carbon emissions reduction—into the loan or the bond itself” Cook explains. “The client obtains a margin or a pricing benefit because we set targets for those specific KPIs over the tenor of the facility.”





For small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) looking to engage in the energy transition the bank’s new PowerPulse digital platform enables clients to engage with suppliers that can support them with sustainable energy solutions. “[This] enables clients to engage with accredited energy-solution providers and ultimately ensures they obtain the lowest-cost sustainable-energy solution” says Cook.

The role of banks in absorbing risk among SMEs is a key focus area for HSBC whose global head of Commercial Banking Sustainability Natalie Blyth says that while much of the dialogue on energy transition focuses on the actions of large firms and policymakers the role that smaller enterprises have to play is vital to achieving net-zero targets. “SMEs make up 90% of global supply chains which themselves account for nearly 80% of total carbon emissions” Blyth explains. “Bank support is critical to help SMEs on their transition journey including dedicated SME funds that are available to use for green activities.”

Carbon credits are another area generating excitement with Standard in the early stages of setting up a carbon trading desk. Rabobank for example a world leader in agricultural finance goes beyond financing emissions reductions with a carbon credit program that supports farmers in actually removing carbon from the atmosphere via regenerative practices.

A New Strategy

An effective strategy for the transition should focus on three main areas according to BofA’s Fang: expanding use of mature technologies (such as wind and solar); accelerating development of emerging technologies (such as carbon capture and sequestration electric vehicles green hydrogen long-duration energy storage and biofuels) by reducing the “green premium”; and delivering for emerging markets in collaboration with governments multilateral development banks and development finance institutions (DFIs) by leveraging blended-finance solutions.

Historically BofA’s investments have contributed to the development of approximately 16% of total installed renewable wind and solar energy capacity in the US. In Africa the bank has supported CrossBoundary Energy (CBE) a specialist in commercial and industrial renewable-energy projects in its plans to rapidly scale investment for such businesses across the region. CBE is currently delivering a $230 million portfolio of projects across 14 African countries for more than 30 corporate customers including Unilever Diageo Rio Tinto Heineken and AB InBev.

Regional Challenges

In Africa the need for development combined with a significant wave of oil and gas discoveries create a counterpoint to sustainable energy efforts.

“It’s important to have an Africa lens when we look at some of the Paris Agreement goals—or the goals that have been established by the developed world” Standard Bank’s Cook explains. “Improving living conditions and facilitating economic growth in some of these developing nations and investment in long-term sustainable infrastructure are as important as climate.”

Further given the fiscal stress being felt by a number of African countries a reliance on foreign exchange or dollar-based financing presents further challenges to building up infrastructure. Given a lack of appetite for additional debt support from developed nations DFIs and the blended-finance concept are really required to meet these goals. “Given the challenges many African countries face in terms of fiscal debt” she says “there is a need for some of this funding to be more heavily weighted towards the donor or the grant side of the financing spectrum.”

Emerging Markets

Another example of how the public and private sectors in developed countries are collaborating to deliver more climate finance capital in emerging markets can be found in Indonesia where the government is pursuing a national effort under a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to accelerate the phasing out of fossil-fueled power plants and the ramping up of renewable energy alongside investment in transition-aligned jobs and industries of the future. Contributions to the Indonesia JETP to be mobilized over the next three to five years include $10 billion in public sector pledges and $10 billion in private investment from an initial set of private financial institutions including BofA Deutsche Bank HSBC Macquarie MUFG and Standard Chartered.

Elsewhere in the Caribbean and in Central and South America BofA has worked alongside a multilateral development bank to support InterEnergy Group via a green loan to help develop renewable energy and clean transportation infrastructure projects. It is in emerging technologies such as green hydrogen carbon capture and sequestration long-duration energy storage and biofuels like sustainable aviation fuel that Fang sees a “huge leapfrogging opportunity” for emerging markets.

“Governments will need to continue to play a key catalyzing role” she says “through grants concessionary capital and incentives in order to make the projects bankable by the private sector driving down cost and speeding up the supply-demand flywheel.” The US and developed markets have to take the lead she adds as in the US where the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 offers up $370 billion worth of incentives for sustainability technologies.

“We’re all aligned on this to help drive down the green premium on these technologies such that they are on a par with fossil fuel technology” Fang explains. “Once that equation is reached I believe penetration of these new technologies will become more prolific. I think we can divide and conquer here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2xhdy1maXJtLXNpZ25zLWxlYXNlLWluLWR0bGFzLWJ1bmtlci1oaWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Law Firm Signs Lease In DTLA's Bunker Hill,"Musick Peeler & Garrett LLP a downtown-based law firm with five offices across the state has signed a lease for a two-floor 53000-square-foot office at Brookfield Properties’ Bank of America Plaza in downtown Los Angeles.

Eric Duncanson of Cushman & Wakefield represented Musick Peeler on the transaction. Marin Turney vice president of leasing at Brookfield Properties represented landlord Brookfield Properties in the lease.

“Musick Peeler has been proud to call downtown Los Angeles home for more than 50 years” Joe De Briyn a managing partner at Musick Peeler said in a statement. “We are committed to the dynamic work environment and appeal of downtown L.A. and we look forward to our firm’s next chapter to start at BOA Plaza a place for us to continue to serve our clients maintain our culture and attract top legal talent.”

Added Turney “We are delighted that one of California’s premier law firms is maintaining its presence in the area and ushering in a new era of elevated workspace at our landmark Bank of America Plaza tower.”

Musick Peeler which has called downtown Los Angeles home since 1954 and has a workforce of more than 80 attorneys will be moving into its new location in three or four months.

Turney explained how Musick Peller came to sign an eight-year lease with the building.

“The space was originally occupied by Kirkland and Ellis” Turney said. “When they vacated the space they left us with three contiguous floors with excellent remaining (tenant improvements). There were interconnecting stairs.”

The space had been available for a while during the Covid period when the office sector slid.

“Through the pandemic we were actively marketing the space” Turney said. “The activity throughout the pandemic was slow.”

One of the floors was finally taken by one of the building’s existing tenants the Analysis Group which left floors 29 and 30 available.

“We really wanted a tenant to take the two floors” Turney said.

Musick Peeler has offices in San Francisco and San Diego but the Los Angeles office has been their flagship headquarters.

De Briyn said that his firm is ready for a change after years of being located at its current location.

“The firm has been at the 1 Wilshire building forever” De Briyn said. “We were the first tenant to sign up there in the 1960s. When the time came to re-sign we started to look at other buildings in town. And we wanted to be downtown.”

De Briyn has long been aware of the tower at 333 S. Hope St.

“The Bank of America building has always been one of my favorite buildings” De Briyn said. “It sort of fell into our laps. There was some space that we liked. It was already built out we just had to make some tweaks and adjustments.”

He said heand his employees are looking forward to the relocation.

“Moving is always a challenge but everyone has embraced it so well with the firm” De Briyn said. “They’re very excited about going to a new building a new feel.”

Turney said that the way the floors were built out lent itself to minimal tenant improvements for Musick Peeler.

“It was a modification of the existing improvements” Turney said. “To find a space that matches the tenant’s expectations and reuse the space as is it’s rare when that happens.”

Completed in 1974 the 55-story Bank of America Plaza is one of the most iconic skyscrapers on Bunker Hill. The tower is home to Bank of America the Capital Group Companies and Sheppard Mullin Richter and Hampton.

The building located at 333 South Hope St. boasts direct access to all major freeways public transportation and Brookfield’s shuttle service to nearby parking and downtown L.A. cultural and dining destinations. The building’s signature 4.2-acre public plaza includes Alexander Calder’s “Four Arches” sculpture as well as more than 200 trees and four water features.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXRobGV0aWMuY29tLzQwNTI3MzAvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9wYW50aGVycy10dXJmLXN0YWRpdW0tY29tcGxhaW50LWxpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It was like concrete': It's time for David Tepper to tear out Panthers' turf at BoA,"Panthers owner David Tepper has a lot on his plate this offseason between hiring a head coach and taking another stab at the quarterback riddle that has stumped him.

But there’s something else Tepper should strongly consider putting on his to-do list: tearing out the artificial turf at Bank of America Stadium.

A couple of prominent Panthers players have previously called on Tepper to go back to a grass surface citing concerns over their short- and long-term health. The BoA turf has come under fire after the Lions complained about the field conditions during a Christmas Eve game played in below-freezing temperatures in Charlotte.

The NFL Players Association is expected to file a grievance against the NFL and the Panthers over the hard artificial surface a league source with knowledge of the situation told The Athletic. After the Panthers’ 37-23 win on Dec. 24 Lions quarterback Jared Goff said the field conditions were below NFL standards.

It turns out Detroit players weren’t the only ones who had issues with the field with several Panthers players also critical of the conditions.

“It was like concrete I’m gonna be honest with you” veteran linebacker Shaq Thompson said. “That s— was hard slipping everywhere. On one of (the plays) I slipped hard. … But it is what it is. We’ve gotta play through it. We got through it.”

The temperature at kickoff for the Lions game was 20 degrees making it the coldest home game in Panthers history. Despite some remedial measures taken before the game including dragging the turf the field failed a pregame inspection according to a league source.

Panthers right guard Austin Corbett changed his cleats before the game on the advice of the team’s equipment staff. Corbett switched to a more traditional turf shoe.

“We use them a lot for walk-throughs and different things like that” Corbett said Monday. “But never would I have thought I’d be using (them) in an NFL game that’s for sure.”

Panthers running back D’Onta Foreman echoed Goff’s assessment of the field saying “It probably wasn’t up to the standard honestly.”

Foreman said the field seemed to soften up a bit during the game as the temperature rose slightly.

“Once I got out there for the game I didn’t feel like it was as bad as it was pregame” said Foreman who rushed for a career-high 165 yards on 21 carries against the Lions.

But Thompson thought the field remained rock-hard all game.

“(It) didn’t improve. It was the same way” he said. “They should’ve put a heater down or something I don’t know. It definitely was concrete on there.”

Corbett the Panthers’ NFLPA representative said the field was the hardest he’d played on in five NFL seasons. “And a lot of guys were saying the same thing” he said. “I get it. The wind was ripping through there. It’s cold and the rain freezes up. Body took a beating for sure.”

“It was cold as hell. And I think it kind of rained the night before so that all played a factor” wide receiver DJ Moore added. “When we first went out there it was kind of slick. But to me as the game went on I had perfect footing. I was cool with the surface and everything.”

The Panthers switched to FieldTurf before the 2021 season citing the increased activity at the stadium with the arrival of an MLS soccer team in 2022 and Tepper’s desire to bring more concerts to BoA.

Several NFL stadiums have under-field heating systems including Green Bay Kansas City and Pittsburgh all of which are grass fields. Asked whether BoA has a field heating unit a team spokesperson declined comment and referred a reporter to the league regarding all matters related to the grievance.

Moore was part of a group of veteran players who met with Tepper twice this year — once during training camp and again during the season — to voice their concerns about the artificial turf.

“I know they ask questions about the field conditions no matter where we’re at to get a feel for how it is” Moore said Monday. “So I guess they’re listening and taking what we’re saying into consideration.”

Returning BoA to its grass roots wouldn’t be cheap and time is of the essence: Charlotte FC opens its season at home Feb. 25. But it would not be unprecedented: The Ravens switched back to a grass surface at M&T Bank Stadium in 2016 after 13 seasons with artificial turf.

In fact it’s been done in Charlotte in the past year. Tepper agreed to install a temporary grass field at Bank of America Stadium in July for Charlotte FC’s exhibition against Chelsea the Premier League team that would play the friendly only if it were on grass.

“If they do it for that I think they can do it for all of us — all 32 teams” Thompson said. “Baltimore did it listened to their players and went to grass.”

The Panthers played just two of their 17 regular-season games on grass fields including Sunday’s Week 17 loss at Tampa. Corbett could notice a difference getting out of bed Monday.

“Coming off Tampa my body feels a lot better — just the joints and that beating” he said.

“I understand it’s a business and they’re doing other things. Stadiums have concerts in them and … bowl games with bowl season going on right now. I understand that. It’s the business part. They’ve gotta make their money. I get it” he continued. “Players’ health and just our prolonged health and safety throughout the year has definitely got to be at the forefront.”

Though acknowledging that players can get hurt on grass too Thompson said it’s more forgiving than turf. Earlier this fall union president J.C. Tretter called on the NFL to remove the slit-film surfaces — which statistically result in more injuries than grass — at six stadiums. (The Panthers have a hybrid turf.)

But Thompson took it a step further saying he’d like to see turf banned across the league. Thompson is aware it would cost a lot to do so but said it’s worth it.

“They don’t understand how our bodies feel on that goddamn turf” he said. “They should go to grass.”

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the ETNs described herein involves risks. Selected risks are summarized here but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement.

You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any change in the level of the underlying index between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally if the level of the underlying index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption even if the value of such index has increased or decreased as the case may be. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor fee and other applicable costs the return on the ETNs will always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the index components. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.

Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC and are not either directly or indirectly an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs including any payment at maturity or upon redemption depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value if any of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition if Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.

Market and Volatility Risk: The market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date. You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary market. Factors that may influence the market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the commodity markets the U.S. stock markets or the U.S. Treasury market the index components included in the underlying index and prevailing market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs including economic financial political regulatory geographical or judicial events that affect the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index.

Concentration Risk: Because the ETNs are linked to an index composed of futures contracts on a single commodity or in only one commodity sector the ETNs are less diversified than other funds. The ETNs can therefore experience greater volatility than other funds or investments.

A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a U.S. national securities exchange a trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited as we are not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs.

No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.

Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation.

The ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of sale redemption or maturity of ETNs. Sales in the secondary market may result in significant losses.

Sharanjit was officially ‘installed’ with a celebration event on Wednesday 8th May in the grounds of the Newton Park campus.

The first female Chancellor of Bath Spa University (BSU) and only the second Chancellor in the institution’s almost 20-year history Sharanjit will act as an ambassador for the university on a local national and global stage.

A former BBC World News anchor as well as a leading business and politics reporter her career took her all over the world for almost a quarter of a century.

She now regularly moderates high-level debates for the United Nations multilateral and financial institutions and advises companies and educational institutions on media strategy and diversity.

Living between Bath and her native Singapore Sharanjit is also a Trustee for the Bath Fashion Museum and a Board member at the Holburne Museum. She said she is delighted to become part of the Bath Spa University community to represent the values of students and staff worldwide.

Educated in North America with an undergraduate degree in Journalism and a Master’s in English Sharanjit says she understands what a privilege it is to study have an education and to be curious about the world.

She said: “I stand here because of the socially uplifting power of education that has transformed my life. My late father Kernail Singh Leyl was born in Singapore to a poor immigrant family and was one of eight children.

“He excelled academically and made it to the country’s most prestigious school. He did it through sheer grit and hard work.

“So determined was he to be educated that he studied by streetlamp at a time when Singapore was a developing country and didn’t have reliable electricity coverage.

“Through all his efforts he won scholarships and became the first person to go to university in my family which has led to a completely different life for my brothers and me. It’s a story that truly exemplifies the transformative power of education.

She said her father’s story isn’t a far cry from many of the students at Bath Spa University.

“Over 40% of the BSU student population are among the first in their family to go to university just like my father did. About a quarter of our students are from ethnic minorities like me and many more are working their way through university holding down one or more jobs so they can afford to have an education.

“It shows the sheer grit and determination of the students here at BSU who are so much like my father students whom I’m inspired by and so proud to represent and truly embodying the spirit of Bath Spa University – The Sunday Times University of the year for Social Inclusion.”

Bath Spa University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Sue Rigby welcomed Sharanjit to the BSU community during the ceremony with pledges music and performances from students and staff.

Sharanjit will be presenting certificates to some students at BSU’s summer graduation ceremonies as well as attending numerous informal and more formal events throughout the academic year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbWVyc2V0bGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3NvbWVyc2V0LW5ld3MvdHdvLW1pbmktZm9yZXN0cy1wbGFudGVkLWFjcm9zcy05Mjc2NTE20gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29tZXJzZXRsaXZlLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc29tZXJzZXQtbmV3cy90d28tbWluaS1mb3Jlc3RzLXBsYW50ZWQtYWNyb3NzLTkyNzY1MTYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two mini-forests planted across Bath,"Something went wrong please try again later.

He is the Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway a conglomerate controlled by his close friend and business partner Warren Buffett. Munger has had a successful career in his own right but he is perhaps best known for his partnership with Buffett and their successful investment strategies.

Munger’s career and accomplishments

Munger began his career as a meteorologist in the U.S. Army before transitioning to law and eventually settling on a career in investing. He co-founded investment firm Munger Tolles & Olson in 1962 and later joined Berkshire Hathaway as Vice Chairman in 1978. Munger has been credited with helping to grow Berkshire Hathaway into the successful company it is today and he is often referred to as the “right-hand man” to Buffett.

In addition to his career in investing Munger has also made significant contributions to various charitable causes and is known for his philanthropy. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to various organizations and causes throughout his lifetime.[1]

How Munger and Buffett met and formed a partnership

Munger and Buffett first met in the late 1950s when a mutual friend introduced them. The two hit it off and began working together eventually forming a partnership for over 60 years. Munger joined Berkshire Hathaway as Vice Chairman in 1978 and the two have worked together ever since. Their partnership has been instrumental in the success of Berkshire Hathaway and the two are known for their complementary investment styles and philosophies.

Munger’s net worth compared to Buffett’s

Charlie Munger’s current net worth is estimated to be around $2.3 billion according to Forbes while Warren Buffett’s net worth is significantly higher at around $107.6 billion.

While both men have had successful careers in investing and have grown their wealth significantly over the years there is a significant difference in their net worth.

Why Munger’s net worth is lower despite their partnership and similar investment strategies

There are a few reasons why Munger’s net worth is lower than Buffett’s despite their partnership and similar investment strategies.

Factors that contribute to Munger’s lower net worth

Differences in salary and compensation: One reason for the difference in net worth between Munger and Buffett is the difference in salary and compensation. Munger’s salary and compensation as Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway are lower than Buffett’s as CEO.

The impact of philanthropy: Munger is known for his philanthropy and has donated millions of dollars to various charitable causes throughout his lifetime. This generosity has likely impacted his net worth.

An early decision to give away a significant portion of his wealth: Munger made the decision to give away a significant portion of his wealth earlier in his career which did not allow Charlie Munger to benefit as much from the power of the compounding of his investments from as young an age that Buffett continued to benefit from.

Earlier start in investing: Warren learned about stocks as a kid and his Dad actually had him buy his first shares in 1942. Buffett’s financial trajectory and compounding of capital through investing was consistent from the age of eleven years old. At 31 years old Charlie Munger was divorced broke and burying his 9 year old son who had died from cancer.[2] Very different life trajectories as Buffett had a 20-year head start financially. Buffett also never officially divorced.

Social Connections: After graduating Warren Buffett went to his Dad’s acquaintances to raise capital for his first fund. These were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses. Munger’s background was more humble.

Berkshire stock timing: In 1962 the Buffett Partnership began purchasing Berkshire Hathaway at $7.60 per share and shortly thereafter becomes the largest shareholder and eventually took controlling interest. In 1978 Charlie Munger joined Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway as the company’s Vice Chairman. Buffett was acquiring Berkshire stock for 16 years before Charlie Munger started to accumulate it.

Why is Charlie Munger worth so little?

Time: Warren Buffett’s biggest edge that created such a disparity in their comparative wealth over their lifetime was simply time. Buffett’s head start in investing and unbroken chain of perpetual compounding was a huge edge. Buffett’s 16-year head start in accumulating what made them both billionaires Berkshire Hathaway stock at rock bottom prices before it was built into one of the biggest companies in the world was the key dynamic of variance in net worth outcomes.

Munger’s investment philosophy and approach

Charlie Munger is known for his value investing philosophy which involves seeking out undervalued companies with strong potential for growth and holding onto those investments for the long term. He and Buffett have similar investment approaches but Munger is known for his more analytical and disciplined approach to investing. Munger also convinced Buffett that the price you pay for a stock is less important than the upside potential of a stock over the long term.

One of Munger’s key principles is to only invest in companies he understands and knows about. He has said that it’s important for investors to have a “latticework of mental models” that allows them to understand and analyze businesses in various industries.

Examples of successful investments made by Munger

Some of the successful investments made by Charlie Munger include:

Berkshire Hathaway: Munger has been instrumental in the growth of Berkshire Hathaway and has helped to turn it into the successful company it is today. Munger has held the majority of his net worth in Berkshire Hathaway stock for the majority of his adult life.

Costco: Munger has been a vocal supporter of Costco and has praised the company for its focus on offering high-quality products at low prices.

Wells Fargo: Munger has been a long-time investor in Wells Fargo and has praised the company’s focus on conservative lending practices.

Conclusion

Charlie Munger is a highly successful investor and businessman with a net worth of around $2.3 billion. Despite the difference in net worth Munger has had a successful career and has made significant contributions to the investing world through his disciplined approach to value investing. Munger has been an avid teacher to his audiences in speeches question and answer sessions and through interviews explaining his philosophy of seeing the world through the filter of mental models for how it works.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXF1b3Rlcy0yMDIyLXN0b2Nrcy1iaXRjb2luLWNyeXB0by1tdXNrLWJlem9zLWluZmxhdGlvbi0yMDIzLTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Best Quotes of 2022: Stocks Bitcoin Musk Bezos,"Warren Buffett trashed bitcoin praised Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and decried stock-market gambling.

Warren Buffett called out stock-market gamblers dismissed bitcoin as worthless and lauded Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos in 2022.

The 92-year-old investor said he's not planning to retire as Berkshire Hathaway CEO anytime soon slammed companies that report misleading financials and recommended one way for people to offset inflation.

He made the comments in his yearly shareholder letter at Berkshire's annual meeting and during an interview with Charlie Rose.

Here are Buffett's 10 best quotes of 2022 lightly edited for length and clarity:

1. ""Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers."" (Buffett was referring to his longtime business partner and Berkshire's vice-chairman Charlie Munger.)

Advertisement

2. ""Deceptive 'adjustments' to earnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen. Speaking less politely I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull.""

3. ""Teaching like writing has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon the 'orangutan effect': If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas you may leave behind a puzzled primate but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.""

4. ""I know I'll win over time. That doesn't mean I'll beat everybody else or anything like that. But the game is very very very easy if you have the right lessons in your mind about what you're buying."" (Buffett was underscoring that he views shares as pieces of a business.)

5. ""We have a successor in place but he's not warming up. I'm in overtime but I'm out there.""

Advertisement

6. ""Elon is taking on General Motors and Ford and Toyota and all these people who've got all this stuff and he's got an idea and he's winning. That's America. You can't dream it up. It's astounding.""

The store called Bro Bros Closet has expanded over the last seven years from an online-only operation to a physical location in south Minneapolis where the brothers focus on building relationships with customers and their community.

“When we’re able to help customers find a nostalgic item or something that brings a smile to their face that’s the most rewarding thing” Daniel said.

Making it happen

Salvador the middle brother and a Best Buy finance analyst brought the idea to his brothers when he sold a vintage jersey online. Luis the oldest brother and a social impact associate manager and Daniel immediately got on board.

The brothers began sourcing clothing and storing their finds in Luis’ basement. Then they’d sell the items online.

When choosing products the brothers take inspiration from what they were surrounded by growing up in the Minneapolis metro area. They began by finding 1990s streetwear mostly focused on sports or bands.

As the business began to grow the brothers would write their goals on sticky notes posted on the walls and check them off as they accomplished each one. In 2020 Bro Bros Closet checked off one more goal when they signed a lease for their first brick-and-mortar operations in south Minneapolis.

Having hosted vintage pop-up shops in the past the brothers knew a face-to-face element would be exciting for customers.

“Each piece we carry is unique and having an in-person experience with someone to help in the store makes a huge difference” Luis said.

The store opened in early 2021 and has allowed the Salado-Herrera brothers to express more of who they are by more authentically connecting with customers and curating products they love. In addition to clothing Bro Bros Closet offers vinyl records and CDs and features work from artists in Minnesota and the greater Midwest.

“Seeing other people happy in our store and hearing all the nice things they have to say brings me joy” Salvador said.

Balancing Bro Bros Closet and Best Buy

While Daniel works full-time at Bro Bros Closet Luis and Salvador balance their full-time jobs at Best Buy and time with the family business.

Luis first joined the company in 2019. He said the values and culture at Best Buy are important to him and are why he encouraged his brothers to also come work at Best Buy. Salvador joined the company in 2021 and Daniel completed an internship with Best Buy last summer.

“We have a similar approach to Bro Bros Closet that Best Buy has which is to put the customer at the heart of what we do” Luis said. “We want our customers to have true self-expression and to feel like they’re part of something.”

Salvador is also grateful for his colleagues’ support.

“We give it 100% at Best Buy and 100% at Bro Bros Closet” he said. “Everyone at Best Buy is understanding and wants us to succeed at both.”

Now that their physical store has been opened for over a year the brothers are focused on expanding their presence online outside of Minneapolis and launching a website.

“It makes me so proud when I think about what we have accomplished in the last six years” Luis said.

Even for chains that survived the pandemic a spate of closures could be on the horizon for both department stores and large retailers in 2023 in Maryland UBS analysts predicted in mid-December of 2022. (Rachel Nunes/Patch)

MARYLAND — In 2020 and 2021 the coronavirus pandemic forced retailers to change everything about the way they do business. And even as Maryland recovers from shutdowns shifts in consumer buying habits amid nagging inflation have hurt long-standing retail brick-and-mortar businesses.

As the threat of recession looms over Maryland chains could face yet another difficult year with a whole new set of challenges. Months of inflation have caused operating costs at retail spaces to spike and have chipped away at the sales of mid-tier retailers experts said. Even for chains that survived the pandemic a spate of closures could be on the horizon for both department stores and large retailers in 2023 UBS analysts predicted in mid-December of 2022.

""These trends are likely not good for department stores as both luxury companies as well as off-price retailers compete directly with department stores"" UBS analysts Jay Sole Mauricio Serna Shoshana Pollack and Tiffany Agard told Insider. ""We expect department stores to close locations as challenges persist."" “[W]e believe department stores face many challenges ahead” Sole said as reported by RetailDive.com. “We model very weak earnings outlooks for Nordstrom Kohl’s and Macy’s and believe these challenges are not fully appreciated by the market.”

Here are the chains that analysts say might close entirely or close many of their stores in 2023. 1. Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond is set to close more than 150 stores across the nation as part of a plan to strengthen business at remaining stores. No Maryland stores have been listed as closing in 2023 so far. In 2020 the retailer closed three Maryland stores in Gaithersburg Hanover (Arundel Mills Mall) and Salisbury.

Here are the current Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Maryland: Annapolis: 200 Harker Place Suite 200

Bel Air: 559 Baltimore Pike

California: 23415 Three Notch Road Unit 9B

Columbia: Snowden Square 9021 Snowden River Parkway

Frederick: Riverview Plaza 5413 Urbana Pike

Gambrills: 2382 Brandermill Boulevard Suite 102

Germantown: 12940 Middlebrook Road

Hagerstown: 17716 Garland Groh Boulevard

Ocean City: 12641 Ocean Gateway

Rockville: Congressional North Shopping Center 1519 Rockville Pike

Towson: The Towson Place 1238 Putty Hill Avenue Suite 1

Waldorf: 3270 Crain Highway

Westminster: 200 Clifton Boulevard 2. CVS

CVS announced in November 2021 that it would shutter more than 900 locations over three years — 300 stores per year. The company said the closures would reestablish a ""new retail footprint strategy aligned to evolving customer needs"" Yahoo reported. 3. Rite Aid In the spring of 2022 the retail chain announced it would close 145 stores before the year's end.

The company cited unprofitability as the main reason to close so many stores. Officials said the closures were meant to ""significantly reduce costs."" 4. Kroger/Safeway/Harris Teeter Grocery stores were hardly spared from the ""retail apocalypse"" which decimated the shopping industry from 2017 to 2020. Two of the nation's largest grocery chains — Kroger and Albertsons — announced a $25 billion merger in October. Kroger closed several stores in 2021 and 2022 and will continue shuttering locations in 2023. Both retailers own grocery stores that are prevalent across Maryland: Harris Teeter and Safeway. There are 60 Safeway stores in Maryland and 18 Harris Teeter stores in the state. Company officials have not said which stores would be affected by the pending merger. ""Closing a store is a difficult decision and one that we take very seriously"" Lori Raya president of Kroger's Mid-Atlantic Division said in a statement after closing a store that opened in 1979 according to BestLife. ""This store's low financial returns made it unfeasible to continue to operate while still upholding our low-price commitment to our customers.""



5. Nordstrom While it's unclear whether Nordstrom will completely fold in 2023 analysts predict that the retailer will be ""under pressure"" in the first half of 2023 Insider reported. The news website also reported that analysts predict a wave of department stores will close in 2023. In August 2020 the Annapolis location of Nordstrom closed the Capital reported. 6. Sears Once a shopping behemoth that sold everything from clothes and toys to house kits the last Sears store in Maryland will close in January 2023. Sears at Francis Scott Key Mall in Frederick will close Jan. 15 a manager told the Frederick News-Post. 7. Best Buy

This struggling electronics retailer has been quietly closing more stores each year. The chain closed 20 locations in 2019 and 20 more in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic forced mass closures of retailers across the nation. In early 2021 the chain announced plans ""to close a higher number this year."" The company did not reveal the total number of its stores. Media reports suggest that at least 60 Best Buy stores closed in 2021. Best Buy currently has 23 locations in Maryland. In late 2021 the Best Buy at Arundel Mills closed permanently. In a March 2022 Star Tribune article Best Buy executives said they expected business to continue to taper. In a 2022 BizJournals.com article Best Buy CEO Corie Barry predicted that supply chain issues labor shortages and continued outbreaks of COVID-19 globally could lead to unexpected shutdowns of factories that could ripple through the markets she said. Correction: An earlier version of this article misattributed the statement made by Best Buy CEO Corie Barry."

Fabrication

Polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels were fabricated based on a previously described method45. Pre-polymer solutions for hydrogels mimicking healthy (soft) and HCM (stiff) myocardium were made by combining acrylamide (Bio-Rad) bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad) Dulbecco’s PBS (Mg2+ and Ca2+ free) (Life Technologies) and deionized H 2 O (See Table 1 for recipe). Coverslips were cleaned and activated in an ozone cleaner for 1 min on each side (Bioforce Nanosciences UV/Ozone ProCleaner) then functionalized for 5 min in a solution containing 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (0.5% V/V) (Merck) glacial acetic acid (3% V/V) and pure ethanol (96.5% V/V). Functionalized coverslips were rinsed in ethanol for 1 min and allowed to dry in air then coated with dimethydichlorosilane (DCDMS) to create a flat non-adhesive surface to fabricate hydrogels. A polymer solution was then prepared by adding 10 µl of ammonium persulfate (APS) (Bio-Rad) and 1 µl of NNN′N′- tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) (Bio-Rad) to 1 ml of pre-polymer solution. Next 4 or 12 µl polymer solution was pipetted onto DCDMS coated glass slides to achieve a final height of 50 µm (for 10 mm diameter round or 15 × 15 mm2 square coverslips respectively). Functionalized coverslips were then gently placed on top. Hydrogels were allowed 20 min to polymerize before coverslips were removed from DCDMS coated slides and UV sterilized.

Table 1 Pre-polymer solution recipes. Full size table

Functionalization

Hydrogels were rinsed three times in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer (HEPES) (50 mM pH 8.5) (Life Technologies) then immersed in N-sulphosuccinimidyl-6-(4′- azido-2′-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (sulpho-SANPAH; Thermo Scientific) in HEPES (1 mg/ml). Sulfo-SANPAH was activated under UV light (365 nm 10 min) then removed and hydrogels rinsed in HEPES. Hydrogels were then immersed in mouse laminin (ThermoFisher 23017015) in HEPES (25 µg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 ˚C. Prior to use hydrogels were rinsed with PBS to remove unbound laminin.

Atomic force microscopy

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the compressive stiffness of hydrogels and single cells measured in Young’s moduli. Measurements were made with an MFP-3D atomic force microscope (Asylum Research) using 200 µm chromium/gold-coated pyrex-nitride cantilevers with triangular-shaped tips (Nano World model PNP-TR). Measurements were made in 1× PBS (Mg2+ and Ca2+ free) and probed with 2nN indentations (approach velocity: 2 µm/s retraction velocity: 10 µm/s). The linear portion of the contact generated force curve was used to determine Young’s modulus through custom-written code in Igor Pro as previously described46. Indentations were made in triplicate to ensure the stability of measurements and averaged to give an average stiffness per indentation. Six points across each hydrogel were chosen at random to be indented. The average of these six indentations was used as an estimate of the overall compressive stiffness of the hydrogel47. Two technical repeats per biological repeat were characterized to ensure that hydrogels were of a consistent stiffness. Stiffness of cells was characterized by indenting the center of single cells. Approximately 28 cells were indented per biological repeat2748. For single cell stiffness four technical repeats were performed per biological repeat. A minimum of four biological repeats were conducted per condition.

H9C2 cell line

The H9C2 myoblast cell line isolated from rat ventricular tissue was supplied by the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC Salisbury United Kingdom) and purchased from CellBank Australia (Westmead NSW catalog number 88092904). H9C2 cells were cultured as per ECACC instructions. Cells were resuscitated in complete growth media comprised of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose pyruvate ThermoFisher) supplemented with 4 mM glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at 1–3 × 10000 cells/cm2. Media changes were performed once every 2–3 days. Sub-culturing was performed at ~70–80% confluence. To sub-culture or plate onto PA hydrogels DMEM was removed and discarded replaced with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (ThermoFisher) and incubated for ~3 min (37 °C) before centrifuging cell suspension at 1200 rpm (5 min). The supernatant was then removed and the pellet resuspended in pre-warmed complete growth media. For PA hydrogels cells were plated at 10000 cells per hydrogel (soft or stiff) and incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C prior to experimentation.

Adult cardiac myocytes

Mouse model

Male mice were used for all studies. Adult cardiac myocytes isolated from mice expressing the human cTnI gene encoding the human HCM causing mutation cTnI-G203S were used. The mice develop hallmark features of HCM by 21 weeks561735. 10–15-week-old (pre-cardiomyopathic) and 30–50-week-old (post-cardiomyopathic) cTnI-G203S mice were used for in vitro and ex vivo studies. Age-matched mice expressing the normal human cTnI gene were used as controls (wt). Male mice were used to eliminate potential differences in responses due to sex. Experiments were performed in a total of seventy-four 10–15-week-old wt mice ten 10–15-week-old cTnI-G203S mice sixteen 30–50-week-old wt mice and forty-five 30–50-week-old cTnI-G203S mice. All animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of The University of Western Australia in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (NHMRC 8th Edition 2013).

Cell isolation

Adult cardiac myocytes were isolated from wt and cTnI-G203S mice as previously described161749. Mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (240 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection) then hearts excised and cannulated onto a Langendorff apparatus via the aorta. Hearts were perfused with Krebs–Henseleit Buffer (KHB) containing (in mM): 120 NaCl 25 NaHCO 3  4.8 KCl 2.2 MgSO 4  1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 and 11 glucose (pH = 7.35 with O 2 /CO 2 at 37 °C) for: 4 min at 37 °C then 3 min in the presence of 2.4 mg/ml collagenase B then 8 min in the presence of 40 μM calcium. Following perfusion ventricular tissue was teased apart and triturated to dissociate myocytes into suspension. Myocyte suspension was left to settle for 20 min supernatant discarded and myocytes resuspended in calcium free Hepes-Buffered Solution (HBS) containing (in mM): 5.3 KCl 0.4 MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O 139 NaCl 5.6 Na 2 HPO 4 ·2H 2 O 5 glucose 20 Hepes and 2 glutamine (pH = 7.4 at 37 °C) in the presence or absence of 3 mM EGTA (for 0 mM calcium experiments). For calcium containing experiments calcium was titrated back to achieve a final extracellular concentration of 1.8 mM. Myocyte suspensions were plated onto hydrogels and incubate for at least 3 h at 37 °C prior to experimentation. All in vitro studies were performed in freshly isolated quiescent myocytes at 37 °C.

Immunostaining and confocal microscopy

Cells were prepared for confocal imaging based on previously described methods716. Following plating and incubation H9C2 cells or adult cardiac myocytes were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing in mM: 13 KCl 7.35 KH 2 PO 4  0.69 NaCl 40.4 and 40.4 Na 2 HPO 4 ·7H 2 O (pH = 7.4) then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA in PBS for 15 min) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (15 min). Following permeabilization cells were incubated in a blocking solution containing 5% goat serum and 5% horse serum (in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies lamin A (1:400 Abcam ab26300) and vinculin (1:200 Abcam ab130007) in 5% BSA (in PBS 1 h at 37 °C). Cells were then incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (TRITC 1:400 ThermoFisher R415) Goat F(ab) Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (FITC 1:200 Abcam ab7050) and Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 647 1:200 Abcam ab150115) in 5% BSA (in PBS 1 h at 37 °C). Alternatively cells were incubated with a β 1 integrin primary antibody (1:100 ThermoFisher MA1-06906) in 5% BSA (in PBS 1 h at 37 °C) followed by Goat anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® Plus 488 1:400 ThermoFisher A32723) in 5% BSA (in PBS 1 h at 37 °C). Finally cells were incubated with nucleic acid stain DAPI (1:200 in PBS Sigma-Aldrich D9542) for 10 min at room temperature before being mounted onto glass slides for imaging. Cells were imaged on an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescent microscope at 60× magnification.

Fluorescent detection of in vitro mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψ m ) and mitochondrial flavoprotein oxidation

Agonists and antagonists

55′66′-tetrachloro-11′33′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene Oregon USA). Carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) colchicine latrunculin A nisoldipine (S)-(−)-Bay K8644 (BayK(−)) and sodium cyanide (NaCN) were bought from Merck (Kenilworth New Jersey USA). Jasplakinolide was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor Michigan USA); (R)-(+)-Bay K8644 (BayK(+)) from BioVision (Milpitas California USA); and CD-29 from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes New Jersey USA). AID-TAT peptide was synthesized using the amino acid sequence QQLEEDLKGYLDWITQAE including a cell-penetrating TAT sequence (RKKRRQRRR) tethered via 6-aminohexanoic acid (AusPep Tullamarine Victoria AUS)50. The AHNAK-P4N-TAT peptide was synthesized using the amino acid sequence KGKHGKLKFGTFGGLGSKSKGHYEVT tethered to the TAT sequence as previously described (Mimotopes Pty Ltd Victoria AUS).

Mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψ m ) was assessed using fluorescent indicator JC-1 (200 nM incubation period = 3 h ex = 480 nm em = 580/535 nm interval = 2 min exposure = 50 ms)1617. At the end of each experiment mitochondrial electron transport blocker sodium cyanide was applied to collapse Ψ m  confirming that the JC-1 signal was indicative of Ψ m (NaCN 40 mM). Mitochondrial flavoprotein oxidation was assessed by recording myocyte autofluorescence as previously described (ex = 480 nm em = 535 nm interval = 1 min exposure = 250 ms)1617. Mitochondrial electron transport chain uncoupler FCCP (50 μM) was added at the end of each experiment to increase flavoprotein oxidation confirming signal was mitochondrial in origin. All in vitro fluorescence was measured on an Andor Zyla SCMOS 5.5 MP camera attached to an inverted Nikon TE2000-U microscope. Ratiometric JC-1 or flavoprotein fluorescent images were quantified using Metamorph 7.10. Regions containing myocytes were manually traced to obtain a fluorescent signal for each cell. An equivalent region not containing cells was used as background and subtracted for each cell. Responses to treatments were reported as a percentage increase or decrease from the pre-treatment (basal) average.

Immunoblot studies

The protein concentration of all samples was quantified using the Bradford protein assay using BSA as a standard. 25 µg samples were loaded into precast 10% BIO-RAD Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-FreeTM SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-RAD Laboratories) then electrophoretically transferred to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot® TurboTM Transfer Pack Bio-RAD Laboratories) using the Bio-RAD Trans-Blot® TurboTM Transfer System. Blots were stripped between each re-probing step using stripping buffer consisting of (in mM): Tris HCl pH 6.8: 62.5 2-mercaptoethanol: 100 2% SDS 30 min at 50 °C). Quantitative densitometry was performed on images captured using a Chemidoc imaging system (Bio-rad) and ImageJ software. Data are presented as optical density of protein expression normalized to loading control detected on the same blot.

LTCC (Ca V 1.2) and β 1 integrin protein

Immunoblot analysis was performed on total heart homogenate pooled from groups of five 10–15-week-old and 30–50-week-old wt and cTnI-G203S mice. Briefly snap frozen hearts were weighed ground into a fine powder in liquid N 2 using a mortar and pestle and homogenized in 1:4 RIPA buffer consisting of (in mM): NaCl 150 Tris 50 Na 4 P 2 O 7 20 Na 3 VO 4 2 NaF 1 0.5% Na deoxycholate 1 % Triton X-100 0.1 % SDS pH 7.4 supplemented with cOmplete™ Mini EDTA-free Protease (Roche 4693159001) and PhosStopTM phosphatase (Roche 4906837001 1:100 dilution) inhibitor tablets. Total heart homogenate was then centrifuged at 10000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-Ca V 1.2 (Alomone ACC-003 1:200) or rabbit monoclonal anti-β 1 integrin (D6S1W) (Cell Signaling Technology 34971 1:1000). Rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology 2118 1:1000) was used as a loading control. Blots were then probed with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) pre-absorbed secondary antibody (Abcam ab97080 1:10000).

Statistics and reproducibility

Results are reported as mean ± SEM. For nonparametric data statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05 using the Mann Whitney test (two-sided) or Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way) for multiple comparisons. For parametric data statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05 using a Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test (one-way) (GraphPad Prism version 9.1.2). Number of replicates and statistical comparisons are specified in figures.

Power and Sample Size software (PS) was used to determine sample size taking into consideration inter-animal variability and intra-animal variability. With this it was determined that responses would need to be studied in 10 mice from each mouse strain/genotype in order to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of experimental groups are equal with probability/power of 0.95 (type I error probability = 0.05). Of note p values resulting from all in vitro data ranged from p < 0.0001 through to p < 0.0216 indicating that the sample sizes utilized were sufficient to exceed the set significance level.

No data obtained from live cells were excluded. All attempts at replication in live cells were successful. For in vitro studies experiments involving the use of different agonists/antagonists were performed across different experimental days in a random manner. Additionally two individuals ran experiments concurrently on two different fluorescent experimental set ups. One individual was privy to the agonists/antagonists being applied to ensure correct agents were applied in the correct order. The other individual was blinded. Data were reliably replicated between individuals in all instances.

From July to Augustus 2020 we continuously recorded the operative temperature within native habitats of M. virgata using biomimetic thermal loggers62. An iButton data logger (DS1922L Maxim Integrated) was inserted into the shell cavity of a mussel (shell length 4–5 cm) whose soft tissues had been removed. Then the Robomussel was completed by filling the shell cavity with Flame Retardant Compound (Scotchcast 2130 3 M MN USA) to waterproof the electronics. All Robomussels used for measuring were also calibrated using a digital thermometer (Fluke 54II Fluke WA USA). The Robomussels were then deployed at a field site at the Dongshan Swire Marine Station (D-SMART) China (23.65°N 117.49°E) in which two types of microhabitats coexisted at rocky shores. One representing a refuge completely sheltered by rocks (shaded microhabitats) and the other occurred in full sunlight (sun-exposed microhabitats). In each microhabitat where the M. virgata had a high abundance two Robomussels were deployed between 1.80 and 2.50 m above the chart datum (CD the level from which depths displayed on a nautical chart are measured). The temperature was recorded at an interval of 1 h and an accuracy of 0.5 °C. The 99th percentile of all temperatures recorded (T 99 ) was calculated as the highest temperature occurring within habitats in each month and the average daily maximum temperature in each month (ADM) was calculated as the average of all daily peaks in each month20.

The mortality of the mussels was calculated via quadrat methods in microhabitats where the Robomussels were deployed in July 2020. A total of 18 quadrats (25 cm × 25 cm) were deployed (3 quadrates × 2 types of microhabitats × 3 microhabitats) and the number of M. virgate in each quadrate was counted. A mussel was regarded as alive if the shell kept closed or closed immediately when it was touched whereas it was regarded as dead if the mussel was empty or had no response when it was touched. Then the mortality was calculated and the difference in mortality between the sun-exposed and the shaded microhabitat was compared using statistical tests.

Heart rate measurement and sequencing library construction

From February to December 2016 and every 2 months M. virgata individuals were randomly sampled on the rocky shore in Dongshan Island Fujian Province (117°29’ E 23°39’N). Then the mussels were transported back to the laboratory within three hours and immersed in fresh seawater with a temperature of ~20 °C and a salinity of ~33 psu to simulate the seawater in situ. Before performing the heart rate measurements a 3-day common garden acclimation was conducted during which seawater was aerated continuously and exchanged daily and the mussels were fed daily with concentrated Chlorella. For the non-invasive heart rate measurement experiments63 the designated temperatures increased at a rate of 6 °C h−1 in the air from acclimation temperature (~20 °C) until the heart rate fell to zero. For detecting the heartbeat of mussels an infrared sensor fixed (with Super Glue Loctite USA) to the mussel shell at a position above the heart (next to the mid-dorsal posterior hinge area) was used. Then we recorded the amplified and filtered variations in the light-dependent current produced by the heartbeat using an infrared signal amplifier (AMP03 Newshift Portugal) and PowerLab AD converter (8/30 ADInstruments Australia) and viewed and analyzed the heartbeats using LabChart v7 (ADInstruments Australia). The Arrhenius Breakpoint temperature (ABT) for cardiac performance is the temperature after which the HR decreases sharply with constant heating was determined using a regression analysis method that generates the best fit line on either side of a putative break point for the relationship of ln-transformed heart rate (beats per minute) against absolute temperature and calculated using segmented package in R version 4.1.06465. ABT temperature was an indicator for determining when anaerobic metabolism is activated by sublethal physiological stress and has been used as a common index for evaluating sublethal thermal tolerance in molluscs242526.

For identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a total of 64 extracted DNA samples (21 collected in April 23 collected in August and 20 collected in December) genome-wide double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) was performed. We prepared the sequencing libraries based on a protocol adapted from the McDaniel Laboratory at the University of Florida (https://mcdaniellab.biology.ufl.edu/data/) in which the EcoRI and MspI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs MA USA) were used. Libraries were then sequenced as 150 bp paired-end reads using Illumina NovaSeq at Berry Genomics Corporation (Beijing China) and deposited in BioProject (PRJNA517974) and BioSample (SAMN10849586–SAMN10849649) databases at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information).

Genome-wide association mapping analysis

The ddRADseq data described above and our M. virgata genome (BioProject: PRJNA910323) were used for identified SNPs in the 64 samples at the genome-wide level. The reads were first cleaned using fastp66 aligned to reference with the BWA-MEM algorithm67 and sorted using SAMtools68. The BAM outputs were then processed via gstacks script of package Stacks69 to create loci and identify SNPs with unpaired reads discarded (--rm-unpaired-reads). Candidate loci were then filtered and converted to VCF file using the populations script of the package Stacks. The following parameters including a maximum number of missing samples per locus of 20% (-r 0.8) a minimum number of populations of three (-p 3) a minor allele frequency of 0.05 (-min_maf 0.05) by populations script and a maximum per-SNP missing percentage of 10% (--geno 0.1) and an exact Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium p value less than 1e−6 (--hwe 1e-6) by PLINK version 1.90 program70 were used for determining whether a locus could be retained. Then those retained SNPs were further pruned by performing linkage disequilibrium (LD) based SNP pruning utilizing the PLINK option “--indep-pairwise 50 5 0.2”. Filtered loci were functionally annotated with ANNOVA71. Finally the genotype-phenotype association analysis using 48 out of 64 sample’s ABT values as thermal-tolerant phenotypic traits was performed with PLINK. To further reduce the possibility of false positives the p values of those associated SNPs were adjusted using the genomic-control method as described by ref. 72. The function of the gene at which the mutant sites were located was first confirmed by referring to the annotation file of the M. virgata genome and then the exact function of the gene was further classified based on BLAST results molecular phylogeny and inspection of conserved domains.

Cloning and Sequencing of the M. virgata USP15 gene

Total RNA was extracted from the adductor muscle of one mussel using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen China). The RNA purity was determined by measuring the A260/A280 ratio on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer while RNA integrity was visually assessed by using 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA was synthesized from isolated RNA by using a PrimeScript™ II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa China) following the manufacturer’s protocol and used for PCR-amplification with the primer pair (uch-CDS) based on the annotated M. virgata USP15 gene (MvUSP15 gene) from the M. virgata genome (Supplementary Table 5). PCR reactions using LA Taq enzyme (TaKaRa China) were performed on the thermal cycler (Biometra) with an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 3 min followed by 39 amplification cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s annealing at 51 °C for 30 s elongation at 72 °C for 2 min and 30 s and the reactions were terminated with an elongation step of 72 °C for 10 min followed by cooling at 4 °C. The amplified products were first purified using an AxyPrep™ DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Corning China) followed by an independent ligation process into the pMD19-T Vector system (TaKaRa China). Then the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli Stellar Competent Cells (Clontech). The cells were cultured on LB plates containing ampicillin. The positive transformants were sent to Sangon Biotech (https://www.sangon.com/) for Sanger sequencing.

Sequence analysis of MvUSP15

Verified MvUSP15 coding domain sequences (CDS)were used for subsequent analysis and visualization of the nucleic acid sequence. R package RIdeogram73 was used for mapping genome-wide information including gene density and the distribution of the gene family encoding deubiquitinating enzymes on the idiogram. The visualization of the MvUSP15 gene structure was performed using the online tool Exon-Intron Graphic Maker (http://www.wormweb.org/exonintron). DnaSP software was used for the codon usage bias analysis and calculation of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values based on the verified CDS sequence of MvUSP1574.

The deduced amino sequence from the verified MvUSP15 CDS sequence was used for subsequent analysis of the MvUSP15 protein. The ExPASy ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was used for molecular mass and isoelectric point calculations. The analysis of protein domain architectures was conducted using the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) website (https://smart.embl.de)75. Database homology searching was performed using the BLAST program at the NCBI website (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The corresponding sequences were obtained from GenBank and then aligned using MEGA X software (https://www.megasoftware.net/)76. Evolutionary analysis and Bayesian phylogenetic tree construction were performed using MCMC methods which were conducted with BEAST v2.6.6 software77. Motif structure analysis for every protein sequence was conducted on the MEME website (https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/meme.html)78.

We compared the stability of two orthologous mRNAs of MvUSP15 with the base difference (G or A) at synonymous mutation 1881663_28. The free energy change occurring during the formation of the ensemble of secondary structures (ΔGfold) was used as an index for estimating the stability of mRNA structure5155. We first performed the free energy minimization structure prediction for two orthologous mRNAs from 22 °C (295.15 K) to 52 °C (325.15 K) using the Fold program79 with default parameters in the RNA structure package. The ΔGfold for two orthologous mRNAs was calculated by using the efn2 algorithm80. Calculations were performed with default parameters at different temperatures (22° to 52 °C) along the predicted secondary structure determined using the Fold program.

Sample collection acclimation and heat treatment of M. virgata individuals

Mussels were collected in both the shaded and sun-exposed habitats along the shoreline in D-SMART on July 31st 2021. Specimens collected in the two microhabitats were acclimated for two months a period likely to be sufficient to achieve the fully acclimated state8182. During laboratory acclimation the mussels from shaded and sun-exposed microhabitats were held separately in two plastic containers and immersed in fresh seawater at the water temperature of ~20 °C and salinity of 33 psu. Seawater was aerated continuously and exchanged daily. The mussels were fed on concentrated Chlorella every 2 days. After acclimation the mussels from each microhabitat were randomly allocated into a heat-treated group or a control group. In the heat-treated group mussels were heated in the air using a water bath (TXF 200; Grant UK) from the acclimation temperature (22 °C) to 42 °C the sublethal temperature for M. virgata24 at a rate of 6 °C h−1 for simulating the stressful thermal environment during emersion in summer while the control group was kept at 22 °C in air. After the heating process both the heat-treated and control group were dissected and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Genotyping for M. virgata individuals

Total DNA was extracted from the foot muscle of the mussels in both the heat-treated group and control group with the CTAB method following the protocol based on Littorina saxatilis83. The DNA purity was determined by measuring the A260/A280 ratio with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific China) and the DNA integrity was visually assessed by 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis.

PCR-amplification reactions using the primer pair (GT-454) designed based on MvUSP15 (Supplementary Table 5) were conducted with the rTaq enzyme (TaKaRa China) using a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad China) with an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 amplification cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s annealing at 40 °C for 30 s and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. The reactions were terminated with an elongation step of 72 °C for 3 min followed by cooling at 4 °C. The amplified 454-bp products containing the synonymous mutation locus were sent to Sangon Biotech (https://www.sangon.com/) for Sanger sequencing. A total of 179 mussels were genotyped successfully. Sanger sequencing files were viewed in SnapGene software (https://www.snapgene.com/) and the genotypes of those 179 mussels were recorded in Supplementary Data 3.

mRNA Expression of MvUSP15 by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR

The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments were conducted to examine the level of MvUSP15 mRNA concentration of which the whole process met MIQE standards84. Total RNA was extracted from the adductor muscle of mussels in both the heated-treated group and the control group using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen China) and cDNA was synthesized using a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara China). The qRT-PCR analysis was conducted to quantify the MvUSP15 transcript levels on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Specific primers (Qpcr1) for MvUSP15 were designed based on the identified sequence. The elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) was chosen as the reference gene for internal standardization (Supplementary Table 5)85. These two pairs of primer sequences were validated by melting curve analysis to ensure there were no nonspecific product amplification and primer-dimer formation. The PCR efficiencies for EF-1α and MvUSP15 were calculated by standard curve analysis and were 108.2 and 105.2% respectively. The qPCR reaction was performed using 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa China) following a protocol for a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad): 95 °C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s then 95 °C for 10 s; and the melt curve analysis was then conducted with 0.5 °C increments from 65 to 95 °C for 5 s as per the standard procedure. A no-template control (NTC) was also performed to preclude any extraneous DNA or RNA template from providing a false signal. The NTC thus served as a control for extraneous nucleic acid contamination and as an important control for primer-dimer formation. Each sample was tested in triplicate and the relative expression level of MvUSP15 was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method86. The calculation of relative MvUSP15 expression levels was conducted using Bio-Rad CFX Manager software (https://www.bio-rad.com/).

Statistics and reproducibility

All calculations and comparative analyses were performed using R version 4.1.065 and Two-Step cluster analyses were conducted with SPSS 25 (SPSS Chicago IL USA). A total of 93 mussels were used to compare MvUSP15 expression differences under different microhabitats (sun-exposed or shaded) and heat treatment (heat-treated or control) conditions. For all figures and tables a p value less than 0.05 was used as the criterion of significant difference in all tests.

Kentucky's legislature enacted a law in 2022 that required the state's treasurer's office to publish an annual list of financial firms found to be engaging in a boycott of energy companies. Under the law state entities have 30 days to notify the treasurer's office if they have any direct or indirect holdings of listed firms and must inform those firms. A listed financial institution has 90 days after receiving the notice to end the boycott or face divestment.

""When companies boycott fossil fuels they intentionally choke off the lifeblood of capital to Kentucky's signature industries"" Kentucky Treasurer Allison Ball said in a statement. ""Traditional energy sources fuel our Kentucky economy provide much needed jobs and warm our homes. Kentucky must not allow our signature industries to be irreparably damaged based upon the ideological whims of a select few.""

BLACKROCK'S FINK TALKS UKRAINE RECONSTRUCTIONS WITH ZELENSKYY

Fossil fuel production and use are vital to the state's economy. Ball's office noted there are 143994 energy sector jobs in the state of Kentucky representing about 7.8% of the state's workforce.

Kentucky has the third-most operating coal mines in the country trailing only West Virginia and Pennsylvania making the Bluegrass State the seventh-largest coal-producing state in 2021. Kentucky's mines yielded over 26 million tons of coal according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Kentuckians are also fossil-fuel customers. About 71% of the electrical power consumed by Kentuckians in 2021 was coal-fired the fourth-largest share in the country and energy prices were the second-lowest of any state east of the Mississippi River per the EIA.

BLACKROCK’S ESG PUSH PUTS CEO LARRY FINK IN ACTIVIST CROSSHAIRS

BlackRock and JPMorgan respond

BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are two of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. and were among the 11 companies subject to Kentucky's warning.

BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with about $8 trillion under management while JPMorgan Chase is America's largest bank with over $3 trillion in assets. Both firms pushed back against Kentucky's claims that they're boycotting energy companies.

JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler told FOX Business in a statement: ""The fact is that we are among the largest financiers of the U.S. traditional and renewable energy industries including in Kentucky where we serve some of its largest energy companies and utilities. We believe our business practices are in line with Kentucky law and we are hopeful a deeper look at these facts would lead to reconsideration.""

A BlackRock spokesperson told Fox Business ""BlackRock's only agenda is delivering the best financial results for our clients. On behalf of our clients we have invested approximately $276 billion in energy companies globally. BlackRock does not boycott energy companies and will continue to be investors across the energy sector.""

BLACKROCK NOT CHANGING STANCE ON ESG INVESTING DESPITE CRITICISM

Efforts by investment banks to push environmental social and governance (ESG) standards that often promote investment in green energy ventures at the expense of fossil fuel firms have unnerved lawmakers in states that are major producers of coal oil and natural gas.

Those economic considerations along with concerns that ESG investment strategies may diminish investors' returns have led a number of states to divest state assets from financial firms advocating for such policies.

The US-based asset management giant sold 59900 voting units of CEREIT leaving BlackRock with 28.1 million total units according to the REIT manager’s filing to the Singapore Exchange on 30 December. The transaction leaves BlackRock with 4.99 percent of the REIT’s total issued units down from 5.01 percent previously meaning the company no longer meets the 5 percent threshold to be considered a substantial unitholder.

Under Singapore law substantial unitholders in a REIT must disclose their interest or change in interest in the trust’s voting shares. BlackRock which owns roughly $60 billion in real assets globally first emerged as a substantial unitholder in CEREIT in September 2021 when a filing revealed it had purchased for 382400 units in the trust.

The purchase boosted BlackRock’s total unit holdings to 28.2 million with its share rising from 4.96 percent to 5.03 percent. BlackRock’s share reached 5.88 percent as of March 2022 according to CEREIT’s 2021 annual report.

Sponsored by Australia-based global real estate fund manager Cromwell Property Group CEREIT has a €2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) portfolio made up of more than 110 properties across Europe and the United Kingdom. The collection of real estate assets comprising mainly light industrial/logistics and office properties spans roughly 2 million square metres (21.5 million square feet) of lettable area.

Tough Road Ahead

Like many REITs listed in the Lion City CEREIT which debuted in November 2017 allows locally based investors to access growth opportunities overseas bypassing the increasing competition for a limited pool of quality assets within the city-state.

The REIT had record portfolio occupancy of 95.7 percent as of 30 September 2022 CEREIT’s manager announced in its third-quarter business update last November. Net property income was up 4.5 percent year-over-year leading to 3.8 percent growth in income available for distribution for the first nine months of the year.

Despite this strong performance the REIT’s manager cautioned that it expected transaction activity to slow down in the near term and that the focus would remain on asset and capital recycling rather than acquisitions.

“The rising interest rate environment may negatively impact cap rates and potentially offset some of the gains from higher rentals and occupancy on the overall portfolio valuation in 2023” noted Cromwell EREIT Management CEO Simon Garing in a statement.

Fitch Ratings affirmed CEREIT’s long-term issuer default rating at “BBB-” with a stable outlook in mid-October noting that the REIT benefitted from a measured growth strategy and a geographically diversified portfolio of properties that generate steady rental income.

However the ratings agency expressed concern about the impact of an expected European recession in 2023 and forecast that the REIT’s revenue growth would be flat during the year due to lower occupancy and lost rental income associated with the redevelopment of prime office properties in Milan and Rome.

CEREIT’s portfolio comprises mainly freehold properties in and around major gateway cities across 10 countries. The trust has a minimum portfolio weighting of at least 75 percent in Western Europe and at least 75 percent in light industrial/logistics and office assets.

Brisbane-headquartered Cromwell Property Group has a portfolio of more than 210 properties across Australia New Zealand and Europe with A$12 billion ($8.3 billion) in assets under management as of June 2022.

Trusts in Trouble

Share prices of Singapore REITs have plunged over the past half-year amid a sharp rise in interest rates and soaring inflation which drives up real estate operating expenses. Rising yields on Singapore government securities have also provided an appealing alternative to REITs for risk-averse investors.

Volatility in share prices has made it harder for S-REITs to raise cash and prompted managers to focus on conservative strategies and opportunities to recycle capital according to REIT executives who spoke at the Mingtiandi Singapore Forum in October.

The iEdge S-REIT Index published by the Singapore Exchange which measures the performance of Singapore-listed REITs touched 1136 on 29 December 2022 down more than 16 percent from 1355 nearly a year earlier. CEREIT’s share price dropped to €1.5 on 29 December from €2.53 a year prior."

Kyle Wolfe/Getty Images

The University of California is investing $4 billion with Blackstone to acquire rentals and student housing.

The global asset manager set a benchmark annualized return rate of 11.25% for the funds.

UC's investment could be a case study for other cash-flush higher ed institutions.

The University of California is investing $4 billion in a real estate fund managed by private equity firm Blackstone to acquire rental and student housing which both entities see as bright spots in the cooling US real estate market.

The investment comes at a crucial time for Blackstone's Real Estate Income Trust Inc. fund — also known as BREIT— a $68 billion property investment vehicle that also invests in warehouses data centers and other commercial property types. The fund came under fire in December 2022 when Blackstone limited withdrawals after the finance giant received redemption requests that exceeded the company's liquidity limits.

While investors have the option to sell their shares of the fund on a monthly basis the University of California has committed to holding its shares for at least six years according to a joint statement issued by the parties.

""We consider BREIT to be one of the best positioned large-scale real estate portfolios in the US managed by one of the world's top real estate investors"" said Jagdeep Singh Bachher the University of California's chief investment officer. ""This is an opportunity that comes only through strong trusted partnership.""

Investor interest in student housing developments skyrocketed during the pandemic. According to data from commercial real estate firm CBRE the sector saw more than $10 billion in sales in 2021 — the most recent year of available data — which is more than twice as much as the asset class witnessed in 2020.

However California's multifamily market faces an uncertain future as rising interest rates and slowing migration patterns present challenges for homebuilders in the state according to an economic outlook from the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate.

According to data from Green Street a commercial real estate analytics firm commercial property values in the US declined by 13% year-over-year in November 2022 as high interest rates and the popularity of remote work drove investors away.

Since its inception six years ago BREIT has posted an annualized net return of nearly 13% according to Blackstone. About 70% of the fund's portfolio is located in sunbelt markets such as Nevada Texas and Florida. More than half of BREIT's portfolio is split between rental and industrial properties as well.

The University of California's investment could become a model for other universities with large endowment funds — typically in the billions of dollars — that want to invest in real estate investment trusts or commercial real estate assets. BREIT's portfolio includes assets in popular college towns such as Fort Collins Colorado where Colorado State University is located and Baton Rouge Louisiana which is home to Louisiana State University according to the fund's website.

As part of the agreement Blackstone will also contribute more than $1 billion to support a 11.25% annualized return on the university's investment. If returns exceed that amount Blackstone will be entitled to a 5% incentive fee.

Stephen Schwarzman CEO and Co-Founder of Blackstone added that the investment comes at an ""opportune deployment period for all our investors.""

The contract comes more than seven months after the U.S. State Department approved the foreign military sale on May 26 for Egypt to buy 23 “F” models and related equipment for $2.6 billion.

This is the first contract as part of that potential sale and the country has the option to purchase 11 more a spokesman with Boeing told Defense News.

Egypt plans to replace its fleet of CH-47D helos with the “F” model which will “enhance Egypt’s Chinook capabilities and help effectively accomplish its heavy-lift objectives” Ken Eland vice president and H-47 program manager at Boeing said in a statement.

In its notification to Congress the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the sale would help improve Egypt’s security as a major non-NATO ally of the United States. The United States and 19 other countries operate more than 950 Chinooks.

Initial deliveries are to begin in 2026.

The U.S. Army also ordered two other CH-47F helos for itself the company spokesman said.

The aircraft type features a digital cockpit management system a Common Avionics Architecture System cockpit and advanced cargo-handling capabilities Boeing said in the statement.

How will things look for Boeing (BA -1.51%) in three years? Company management gave some insight on this question at its investor conference in early November. Taking that information at face value the financial forecasting makes the stock look highly desirable. However investing is rarely that simple and Boeing has suffered a series of operational mishaps bad luck and poor decisions in recent years. So let's look deeper at where Boeing could be in a few years.

Boeing's forecasts make the stock look like a great value

Management has decided to make free cash flow (FCF) its crucial metric to follow and be judged on. FCF is what's left over from net income after working capital requirements and capital expenditures have been taken out. It's the flow of cash in a year that can be used to make returns to investors (through dividends and share buybacks) fund acquisitions or as in Boeing's case pay down debt.

FCF should be a crucial focus for Boeing investors because it's gone south in recent years. At the same time Boeing's debt has ballooned as it's had to deal with the grounding of the 737 MAX travel restrictions rocking the airline industry and a series of cost overruns on defense contracts.

The excellent news is that Boeing's FCF target for 2025 through 2026 makes the stock look great. Management is looking for operating cash flow of $12 billion and after $2 billion in capital expenditures is taken out the target is for FCF of $10 billion in 2025 through 2026.

To put that figure into context Boeing's market cap is only $114 billion implying Boeing will generate around 8.8% of that market cap in FCF in 2025–2026. That's an excellent valuation because it means Boeing could pay an 8.8% dividend yield and still grow its business. However Boeing's priority will be to maintain its debt rating by paying down debt as well as investing in the business.

What could go wrong with Boeing's plan?

Everyone loves it when a plan comes together but Boeing has plenty of work to do before its plan comes to fruition. The segmental details are shown in the table below. Boeing plans to reach segmental operating cash flow of $14 billion in 2025–2026. After that there will be a ""drag"" of $2 billion in cash taxes meaning an operating cash flow of $12 billion and then the $2 billion in capital expenditures (as noted above) leading to the FCF of $10 billion.

Segment Operating Cash Flow

2023 Estimate Operating Cash Flow

2025–2026 Estimate Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion $9 billion Boeing Defense Space & Security (BDS) ($1 billion) to ($0.5 billion) $2 billion Boeing Global Services (BGS) $2.5 billion to $3 billion $3 billion

One uncertainty in these projections is BCA's ability to ramp up production of 737 and 787 aircraft. There's no issue with backlog -- where the company has 3510 Boeing 737 airplanes and 413 Boeing 787 airplanes -- and the commercial aerospace industry is recovering. However Boeing will have to ramp up 737 production from around 31 a month in 2022 to 33–37 in 2023 to meet its target of 400–450 Boeing 737s in 2023. Beyond that Boeing needs to produce 50 a month in order to hit BCA's cash flow target.

This is a thing to watch because of supply chain constraints. Notably the ability of CFM International (a joint venture with General Electric) to supply sufficient engines in the face of severe supply chain challenges is a question mark. In addition ramping up aircraft production isn't easy particularly after such a challenging period.

The second uncertainty is BDS's ability to work through fixed-price programs that have caused multibillion-dollar cost overruns and damaged the company's reputation. Management argues that the key programs -- the KC-46 tanker the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and VC-25B or Air Force One -- will be largely derisked by 2025. That's good to hear but investors will have to wait a few years to see if Boeing can overcome its recent poor track record for execution.

Boeing in a few years

It's likely that Boeing will be in better shape in a few years. While a recession would hurt the company (notably its BGS segment) there's enough backlog at BCA to cope with a moderate number of cancellations. Ultimately it essentially boils down to internal execution at BCA and BDS. That's something investors will be watching closely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWF0dGVtcHRlZC10by1jb25xdWVyLWNoaW5hcy1jaXZpbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1za2llc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWF0dGVtcHRlZC10by1jb25xdWVyLWNoaW5hcy1jaXZpbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1za2llcy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Airbus and Boeing attempted to conquer China’s civil aviation skies,"December 9 2022 marked a monumental day for China’s commercial aviation industry when the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) delivered the first COMAC C919 to its launch carrier China Eastern Airlines.

While not the first Chinese mass-produced aircraft the C919 is the country’s first direct shot at attempting to overthrow the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in the best-selling narrow-body aircraft market segment. The Chinese manufacturer’s other jet the ARJ21 which was recently delivered to the first foreign airline in Indonesia has not amassed the same attention and order book compared with the C919.

However the C919 has also failed to amass similar levels of attention as the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 families of aircraft. On the one hand it is understandable. COMAC outselling an already-established aircraft type with its own supporting infrastructure would be highly unusual. On the other knowing how tightly controlled business enterprises are in China it is slightly questionable that state-owned carriers have not ordered thousands of C919s from a state-owned manufacturer.

Perhaps there has to be a fine balance between delivering results and supporting the local industry. After all the various A320 and 737 variants have proven to be capable aircraft and have helped airlines save money on fuel maintenance and other costs by being more efficient with each generation. The C919 on the other hand must still be put through its paces before it can even fly passengers. China Eastern Airlines will need to do this before the Chinese narrow-body aircraft begins carrying paying customers in early 2023.

Still the two narrow-body aircraft from the duopoly have sold very well in the country. According to Airbus’ latest Orders & Deliveries data as of November 30 2022 Chinese airlines have ordered 1638 variants of the A320 family including current engine (ceo) and new engine option (neo) aircraft. Meanwhile Boeing’s data as of the same date shows that carriers in the country have signed up for 1348 various variants of the 737 family ranging from the 737-200 to the latest iteration the 737 MAX. Some orders are associated with third-party leasing companies including those based in other countries that have delivered aircraft to Chinese airlines and might not showcase the full scale of orders.

It is no surprise that both Airbus and Boeing have managed to establish a presence in China. The pair have long sought to become the go-to manufacturer for the Chinese government securing business in a country where demand for air travel has blossomed including domestically. Even the COVID-19 pandemic which is still affecting China with strict policies and huge outbreaks should not derail that growth.

But the duopoly’s players have each adopted different approach to handling their business in China.

Emphasizing domestic production in China

The C919 nevertheless could become a headache for executives at both Airbus and Boeing especially considering how much emphasis was put on innovation-driven development in China in the latest five-year plan.

According to a summary by PwC the government considers self-reliance and self-strengthening in science and technology the pillars of national development strategy.

“The innovation-driven strategy is followed by an initiative to build up a modern industrial system” the summary continued emphasizing that the 14th five-year plan has put more emphasis on that strategy compared with the 13th five-year plan. “The Proposals stresses that China will unswervingly build itself into a manufacturing power put more emphasis on quality and enhance its strength in cyberspace and digital technology signaling the focus and general orientation of our roadmap to the future modern industrial system” PwC’s analysis of the latest economic policy in the country continued.

“In addition it also underlines that China will foster strategic emerging industries such as the new generation information technology biotechnology new energy advanced materials high-end devices new energy vehicles green environmental protection aerospace and marine equipment and accelerate the development of modern service industry new infrastructure and digital economy” one of the Big Four accounting firms concluded.

Does this mean that the opportunity for Airbus and Boeing to sell and deliver aircraft will vanish sooner rather than later?

Well the newest five-year plan also reiterated the importance of the dual circulation strategy. According to Breugel an economic think tank established in Brussels Belgium in 2005 since Donald Trump the now-former United States president began his trade war endeavors against China the country has been attempting to rely on a policy that insulates “the domestic market from the rest of the world by eliminating any bottlenecks whether in terms of natural resources or technology so as to vertically integrate its production and achieve self-reliance served by China’s huge domestic market”.

Trade tensions have continued to boil despite a meeting between the current US President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in November 2022 where the former proclaimed that both sides “can manage our differences prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation”.

The latest flareup was when the US banned the sale of advanced chips and chip-making tooling to China in October 2022 with Biden remarking that 0% of advanced chips were manufactured in the US and that is why “China was lobbying in the United States Congress against passing this legislation [the CHIPS and Science Act – ed. note]”. Those restrictions began to spill over to other countries such as the Netherlands even after the meeting in Indonesia.

And that is where a fundamental difference between the US and the European Union (EU) is shown. The Netherlands while planning on joining the 50-state country in restricting chip access to China would “not copy the American export restrictions one-to-one” stated Liesje Schreinemacher the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands in an interview with NRC a local daily newspaper. Schreinemacher also emphasized that talks are not done just yet because “more time is needed for that”.

Diplomacy matters

Still not all trade wars are fought equally and not all of them affect every industry within a region or geopolitical area.

In July 2022 Airbus announced a deal for 292 A320 aircraft with various Chinese carriers and the list includes Air China China Eastern Airlines China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines. In November 2022 Airbus’ Tianjin Final Assembly Line (FAL) in China began assembling its first A321 aircraft the largest of the A320 family. These are just some of the examples showcasing the fact that Airbus has managed to successfully conduct business in the country. For Boeing though orders from China have been an area of struggle. In the past five years China-designated customers in the manufacturer’s Orders & Deliveries data have ordered 59 aircraft with the last order coming in September 2021. Then Air China signed up for five Boeing 777F cargo aircraft which means that the last passenger aircraft that was ordered by a China-based company was the 737 MAX when the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s (ICBC) aircraft leasing arm ordered three of the type in August 2020.

Interestingly though China “recycled” the 292-strong Airbus aircraft order from July in November 2022 when the state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CASC) announced a deal for 140 aircraft from the European Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM): 132 A320-family jets and eight A350s. The day of the announcement correlated with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s visit to the country. Industry sources noted that the eight A350s were already ordered in 2019 while the narrow-body aircraft part of the deal was already included in Airbus’ backlog in July 2022 according to Reuters.

Announcing deals in coordination with diplomatic visits was nothing out of the norm in China or in the aviation industry for that matter. When then-French President Jacques Chirac visited the country in October 2006 Airbus announced a deal for 150 A320 aircraft and most importantly the manufacturer and Chinese officials finalized an agreement to establish the Tianjin FAL starting in 2008. Airbus broke that record by agreeing to an order for 160 jets destined for Chinese airlines in November 2007.

That record-breaking order also coincided with an official visit from Nicolas Sarkozy the successor to Chirac.

Boeing’s relationship with the country is much more complicated. When China ordered the first aircraft from the Seattleite OEM in 1972 the US did not even have a formal diplomatic relationship with China. The first order was for 10 Boeing 707 aircraft the first-ever jetliner from the manufacturer and came shortly after Richard Nixon visited China the same year in a visit that is considered an icebreaker. Akin to European leaders’ visits when George Bush traveled over the Pacific Ocean in November 2005 Boeing officially shook hands with Chinese officials for 70 737s during the then-President’s visit to Beijing China. When Donald Trump another ex-US President visited the Asian nation for the first time in 2017 a deal for 300 aircraft was announced. However according to a Chicago Tribune report the announcement included – much like the Airbus order – already backlog-booked aircraft.

Boeing’s difficulties in China

Turning back the clocks a few decades reveals that this story has repeated itself in modern times as Boeing struggles to gain new orders from China.

Even already-built aircraft namely 737 MAXs which are still grounded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) remain on tarmacs across the US.

“We have just had to deal with the realities we faced. For geopolitical reasons I am guessing we have been unable to make deliveries that we would like to make to our Chinese customers” David Calhoun the current CEO and President of Boeing told CNBC on December 13 2022 as the manufacturer and United Airlines announced a huge order for 200 aircraft. Calhoun reiterated that the company wants to deliver the airplanes but due to the huge demand for planes across the globe as the duopoly’s members struggle to build aircraft within the deadlines written in contracts with customers Boeing has had “to take advantage of that market”.

“We still have airplanes on the tarmac that they can take” Calhoun concluded.

“This year provides a dramatic opportunity to advance U.S.-China relations” said Ron Woodard President of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) in April 1998 a few months before his retirement. While then-China President Jiang Zemin’s visit to the US in 1997 was deemed “highly successful” by the executive he hoped that Bill Clinton’s endeavor to China a few months later would become an opportunity “to further strengthen commerce and trade ties between our two countries”.

Still despite the complicated nature of the two countries’ relations Boeing managed to dominate Airbus in China and by 2002 it held a 70% market share versus the European aircraft maker’s 20%. The US-based manufacturer has worked long and hard to gain this share teaming up with local officials to ”develop the country’s aviation infrastructure” between 1972 and 2002.

“In the mid-’80s for example the Civil Aviation Institute in Tianjin and Boeing created training programs for maintenance technicians. In order to facilitate repairs Boeing helped develop the Beijing Capital Airport Spares Center. And Boeing the CAAC and the Aviation Industries of China joined forces to begin intensive training of pilots technicians and support staff” read Boeing Frontiers from December 2022 a magazine dedicated to current and former employees of the OEM. The manufacturer invested a further $300 million to help China “develop and expand its air transportation system” between 1990 and 2001.

The same year Boeing headhunted David Wang an executive from General Electric (GE) to lead its China efforts. Based in Beijing China Wang became President of Boeing China holding that role until 2011. In 2002 as well as throughout the first decade of the 21st century the company’s executives continuously reiterated that relationships mattered most.

”There’s an old Chinese saying that [goes] ‘When you drink from the well never forget who helped you dig the well.’ We helped the Chinese aviation industry dig the well and our Chinese friends will continue to remember” said Larry Dickenson the then-Senior Vice President of Sales at BCA in December 2002.

At some point in time the well began to dry up. By 2005 the Chicago Tribune indicated that Boeing controlled two-thirds of the market. However Airbus began taking back control of the market even more aggressively and the European manufacturer’s new aircraft deliveries “rocketed from 18 percent in 1993 to 67 percent last year according to Back Aviation Solutions” noted a Seattle Times report from 2005. Both manufacturers knew that China was the market (with an emphasis on the) and that they would have to give everything to conquer it.

Boeing however became complacent according to C.C. Tien who was quoted in the same Seattle Times article as saying that it was important for the OEM to show interest in Chinese headlines and daily developments. “Those are subtle things. You don’t see the direct payback for a long time” said Tien who left Boeing and at the time was consulting COMAC on its ARJ21 program.

Wang who at that point had been working as the US planemaker’s China President for three years noted that US and Chinese relations needed to become stronger as Boeing and China’s “friendship and cooperation will suffer if those relationships are not strong”.

Much like with the previous chipmaking example politics has helped Airbus to access the market. Wang indicated that the realities of traveling between China and the US for the former’s nationals “seriously affected our competitiveness” European politicians were not as pressing on various issues within China. In 1993 while Bill Clinton was yet to meet Zemin following the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989 when a month-long protest resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was already in China making deals with the local government including an order for six Airbus A340 aircraft in November 1993 according to the Chicago Tribune. Politics has continued to play a part in how the two manufacturers play their game in China as the duopoly is intertwined with geopolitical developments whether they like it or not.

The US government has no official stake in Boeing. Airbus a publicly traded company has institutional shareholders from the governments of France Germany and Spain who collectively own a 25.9% stake in the company.

Drifting apart with the A350 and 787

Airbus and Boeing approached the new millennia quite differently in terms of product strategy. The European OEM moved its chips towards big hubs that would connect millions of people between major urban centers resulting in the Airbus A380 while the US planemaker came in with a leaner approach in the form of the 787 Dreamliner.

Sure Airbus managed to sell five A380s to China Southern Airlines but the double-decker jet could never catch up to the Boeing 787 in terms of sales in the country or globally for that matter. The Europeans recognized the gap in their product offering including the lackluster performance of the A340 and introduced the A350. Their strategic partner to develop this was China. Boeing meanwhile turned to Japan to help them develop the 787 even if it tried its best to save face with the Chinese.

In June 2005 just as Airbus was about to launch the A350 the direct competitor to the Dreamliner Boeing issued a press release titled “Boeing 787 Highlights $600 Million in Contracts with Chinese Suppliers”. It highlighted various parts that were built by local companies from the composite rudder or the wing-to-body fairing panels of the 787 and 737’s forward-entry doors to interior panels for the 777’s control cabin among others.

“China’s aviation industry is providing outstanding technological capabilities and resources that help us meet quality cost and delivery imperatives in our programs – particularly on the new 787. China has been a reliable partner to Boeing for many years and we are honored that they are part of our future with the 787 airplane” said Carolyn Corvi BCA Vice President and General Manager of Airplane Production at the time.

Still Japan became one of the most important industrial partners for the Dreamliner while Airbus turned to China to help them with the A350. In 2009 Laurence Barron who headed Airbus China said that if local suppliers were willing to offer competitive prices the manufacturer would be willing to allocate more than 5% of the airframe work to China. At the time the European OEM already signed deals with local companies to produce rudders and maintenance doors and was looking to negotiate for more according to Barron’s statement at the time.

There is perhaps no better indication of the warm relationship Airbus has enjoyed with China than the fact that the Tianjin FAL which primarily dealt with assembling the A320 family aircraft has also become a Completion & Delivery Centre (C&DC) for the A330 and A350. The lines to finalize the assembly of the A330 opened in 2017 while the center delivered its first A350 in July 2021.

The C&DC’s employees install cabins paint aircraft conduct production flight tests and perform customer flight acceptance flights that lead to a jet’s delivery to the customer. Boeing meanwhile has had a facility akin to Airbus’ C&DC – also called a Completion and Delivery Center – located in Zhoushan China. At the center 737 MAX interiors are installed as well as liveries are painted prior to deliveries to Chinese carriers. As mentioned previously the CAAC has still not ungrounded the 737 MAX leaving the center without a purpose for now. While the Chinese aviation authority held a meeting with Boeing in September 2022 “to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the aircraft type-based training standards for the improved 737 planes” the CAAC said in its announcement there have not been any recent developments regarding the plane’s ungrounding.

Germany’s Scholz visited Xi in Beijing in November 2022 noting in his op-ed for Politico that “China remains an important business and trading partner for Germany and Europe” Biden met Xi in Indonesia prior to the G20s get-together the same month.

“China and the United States need to have a sense of responsibility for history for the world and for the people explore the right way to get along with each other in the new era put the relationship on the right course and bring it back to the track of healthy and stable growth to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole” read a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China released shortly after the meeting ended.

In July 2022 Airbus estimated that it had a 53% market share in China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jZm0tbGVhcC1lbmdpbmVzLWVuaGFuY2UtcGVyZm9ybWFjZS1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How CFM LEAP Engines Enhance The Performance Of The Boeing 737 MAX,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='simpleflying.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /cfm-leap-engines-enhance-performace-boeing-737-max/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E574EC20>, 'Connection to simpleflying.com timed out.

Navy veteran and American Airlines pilot Chip Shanle then remotely controlled the aircraft flying in a chase plane as the Boeing 727 crashed into the ground at 140 miles (225 km) an hour.

What did we learn from the crash?

As seen in the first video the aircraft did not explode even as it broke into several pieces upon impact. It might seem impossible to come out alive from such a crash; however the data from the experiment showed otherwise.

Passengers at the front of the aircraft and the pilots were at the highest risk of death in this experiment but as we moved toward the back of the aircraft the risks began to reduce.

The study found that passengers closer to the wings of the aircraft would face injuries but no life-threatening ones but the ones near the tail would walkway from the impact with few injuries."

The BioFreedom Drug Coated Coronary Stent System is intended to treat a narrowed blood vessel (coronary artery) caused by coronary artery disease. The system consists of a catheter delivery system and a 316L stainless steel metal stent. The stent is coated with the drug Biolimus A9. This stent does not contain any additional elements called polymers or carriers to control the release of the drug.

A doctor inserts the BioFreedom Drug Coated Coronary Stent System’s delivery balloon catheter into a blood vessel in a patient’s arm or groin. The stent is then positioned at the site of the coronary artery and the balloon is inflated. The stent expands and is pressed against the coronary artery wall. The stent remains permanently implanted within the coronary artery to help keep it open and improve the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. The drug (Biolimus A9) is released over time from the BioFreedom stent surface into the coronary artery wall to help prevent re-narrowing which sometimes occurs after the stent is implanted.

The BioFreedom Drug Coated Coronary Stent System is used in people who have narrowed coronary arteries and are at high risk for bleeding due to previous conditions including:

Advanced age

The need for chronic or lifelong anticoagulants (blood thinning medicines such as heparin and others that slow down the process of making blood clots)

History of major bleeding stroke or kidney (renal) insufficiency.

In the primary clinical study 1203 patients at high risk for bleeding were treated using the BioFreedom stent and were able to stop taking one of their two antiplatelet therapy medicines (blood thinning medicines such as aspirin and others that prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to make a clot) after one month. The results showed that people with the stent who stopped taking one blood thinner one month after stent implant but kept taking aspirin were not at increased risk of death or heart attack (myocardial infarction) in the first year compared to people treated with a non-drug coated stent in an earlier study.

The BioFreedom DCS System should not be used:

If the patient cannot take blood-thinning medications (also called antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy)

If a doctor decides that the coronary artery blockage will not allow complete inflation of the angioplasty balloon.

If there is a known hypersensitivity (allergy) or other reason not to use Biolimus A9 or the structurally related compounds such as stainless steel nickel or other metal ions found in 316L.

If there is a known hypersensitivity (allergy) or other reason not to use contrast agents that will be used for the implantation of the stent.

BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWVkaWNpbmVtYWtlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtcmVndWxhdGlvbi9pbnRlcnZpZXdpbmctdHVuZGUtYmVsbG8tZnJvbS1icmlzdG9sLW15ZXJzLXNxdWliYi1jYXJlZXItaGlnaGxpZ2h0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interviewing Tunde Bello from Bristol-Myers Squibb: Career Highlights,"How did your love of science begin?



It started with an interest in nature and wildlife. I spent a lot of time in the garden and in parks in London looking under rocks and being fascinated by insects. And I loved to watch nature documentaries – especially those featuring David Attenborough. At school I found biology – how nature works – fascinating. Biology was my forte but it led to an interest in chemistry and physics.

At that time in the UK there was a lot of support for those going to university. I chose to study biomedical sciences – a course that orientated students towards working in clinical testing and hospital labs.

What was your first job?



My first job in that area was at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead and it really increased my passion for the field. I got to work with auto-analyzers and all sorts of clever analytical systems. After a few years I realized I could either do a fellowship in that profession or do a Masters. I decided that a Masters degree would open up my options. But it also broadened my understanding of instrumentation across multiple fields of sensor technologies. My masters research project involved some work for the US Department of Defence developing gas sensors for tanks to detect chemical warfare agents. It was a great experience.

How did you get involved with pharma?



After my master’s I could either go back to medical laboratory sciences or look for other opportunities. Again I decided to widen my horizons. At the time there were a lot of pharmaceutical industry jobs being advertised for analytical scientists but the hiring process was pretty intense. There was a three-day interview process and discussions with an occupational psychologist which surprised me because I thought it was a low-level position! But I got the position. On the day I joined the company was called May & Baker. By the end of the day it had become Rhône-Poulenc. Today it’s actually Sanofi – because that’s the nature of the pharma industry!

My first foray was in the discovery area. I did a lot of method development bioassay method development and also learned about drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. It was fascinating to find out how drugs were developed. In time I wanted to become more involved in strategic decision making – and I noted that all the senior folks had PhDs. And I was fortunate in that the company sponsored me to do a PhD at King’s College University in pharmaceutical sciences. It was another great experience because I was exposed to another angle – academia. After my PhD I went back to the company and was asked to lead a group in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.

Why did you end up moving to the US?



I was approached by a recruiter who asked if I would be interested in working in the US with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Ultimately I was able to choose between two positions; one involved staying in the field of preclinical drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics that I had been working in the second option was clinical pharmacology and clinical pharmacokinetics.

Curiosity has driven most of my career decisions – I always want to learn more so I opted for the new area which exposed me to many wonderful programs and projects helping me deepen my understanding of drug development. I was there for around five years before being tempted away by Pfizer by more curiosity! I was there for 11 years before returning to BMS to head up the clinical pharmacology organization supporting oncology. At that time BMS was establishing itself as one of the leaders in the immuno-oncology space – a revolutionary new field that really appealed to me. Since then I’ve had great opportunities to work on a host of exciting and impactful programs as well as progress my career.

How has science changed over the course of your career?



When I started out in the pharmaceutical industry it was the age of the blockbuster drugs which took more of a blanket approach to treating diseases. Today however we know that almost all diseases are made up of different subtypes of patients with variations in the disease. Patient populations are becoming more segmented which drives the need for precision medicine. With a greater understanding of biology we can develop therapies that more precisely target the required pathways to actually influence and change that course of a disease.

BMS covers many different therapeutic modalities including small molecules monoclonals antibody drug conjugates and cell therapies which gives us a huge choice in how we develop treatments for various diseases. It is amazing to think about what we can accomplish as well as what we will be able to do in the future.

Right now BMS is one of the leaders in the development of protein homeostasis therapies. In short with a protein degradation platform we can direct the body’s own system to target and degrade specific proteins associated with disease. BMS has a number of agents in clinical development in this space that could revolutionize the treatment of a host of different diseases.

What are the proudest moments of your career?



I’ve been very lucky in my career to have worked on a handful of drugs that have improved patients’ lives. When I joined BMS our PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) had only been approved for one indication. The day I joined it got its second – and now it has been approved for the treatment of many other cancers.

I’m really excited about the immuno-oncology field. To give just one example of the potential of immuno-oncology drugs I point you to the case of the ex-President of the US Jimmy Carter who was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma around 2015-2016. Up until a few years before then this diagnosis would have essentially been a death sentence that would have played out within a year. Instead President Carter was treated with an immunotherapy (not from BMS) – and he’s still with us today.

What drives you day to day?



It’s been a real pleasure for me to form so many great relationships and work with so many great people – all with the common goal of advancing therapies to make a difference. I lead a team so an important part of my job is doing PR for them and letting the broader organization know what they are doing and the value they bring to the drug development process!

By Lee Kyung-min



Lotte Biologics a biopharmaceutical affiliate of Lotte Group said Tuesday that on Dec. 31 it acquired a manufacturing plant of its New York Stock Exchange-listed peer Bristol Myers Squibb in East Syracuse New York.



This is a follow-up to an earlier contract signed last May whereby Lotte agreed to buy the facility for $160 million (203 billion won).



Lotte will be able to generate a profit this year due to the immediate manufacturing and sales of key products at the U.S. facility which it says will be the hub for Lotte's North America operations concerning its contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) business.



The acquisition has moved up the timeline in profit generation by five years the minimum period that would have been needed if it had built the facilities from scratch.



Over 92 percent of the employees at the U.S. facility including core technology experts with at least 15 years of experience will continue working there.



The firm will make further investments of about $70 million in human capital including 70 new hires.



""The East Syracuse site has been an important part of our company's history and our manufacturing network for many decades and we are confident that Lotte will fully leverage the facility its capabilities and its experienced workforce as it continues to play a vital role for patients around the world"" said Karin Shanahan executive vice president Global Product Development and Supply Bristol Myers Squibb according to Lotte's statement.



""We have taken a thoughtful approach to this decision and are confident this will best support the continued evolution of our manufacturing network and our mission to deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.""



Lotte Biologics CEO Richard Lee said the firm will leap forward to become a global CDMO player.



""We seek to generate 1.5 trillion won in sales increase operating profit by 30 percent and raise the corporate value to 20 trillion won by 2030"" he said in a statement.

On Counsell’s watch the Milwaukee Brewers developed All-Star pitchers without drafting them at the top of the first round or fast-tracking them into the major-league rotation. Brown’s curiosity and studious approach to the game led him down this path.

“I had gone into a deep Corbin Burnes dive last year when I was struggling” Brown said. “This was right in the middle of it. This was me struggling in Triple A and then getting hurt. I can tell you about a lot of guys who had bounce-back years.”

Brown laughed and continued: “I did the same thing when I had Tommy John. I can probably rattle off every dude who had TJ in all of North America.”

Brown’s Tommy John surgery cost him most of the 2019 season but he popped up as a prospect in the summer of 2022 when the Philadelphia Phillies traded him for veteran reliever David Robertson. By this time last year Brown had already earned a promotion from Double-A Tennessee and submitted two lights-out starts for the Iowa Cubs. The phone call every player dreams about did not happen.

Opening Day rolled around this season and Brown was still waiting. And then Justin Steele dropped to the ground with a strained left hamstring in the fifth inning of Game 1 making Brown the next man up. Brown 24 struggled in his major-league debut before quickly settling into a hybrid role that took him off the roster bubble.

Brown’s value could be seen in Friday’s 7-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates as he replaced starter Javier Assad and threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings that featured six strikeouts against one walk. Managing Brown’s workload — he threw fewer than 100 innings last year — is a bigger issue than determining whether he belongs.

Brown’s future could be in the rotation — the 6-foot-6 210-pound right-hander certainly looks the part — and the Cubs will keep open that possibility. His heavy fastball/curveball combination has also led reporters to ask Counsell whether Brown could emerge as the team’s closer.

“Ben’s best asset right now is he throws really hard” Counsell said. “Without being too analytical it’s just the hitters’ reaction. He’s beating hitters with the fastball. That’s not easy to do in the big leagues. No matter what your velocity is it’s just not easy to do. He’s beating hitters with the fastball and that makes you cheat. And that makes his off-speed very good. That’s kind of his formula.”

Counsell’s formula for small-market success included more than just Burnes and Woodruff. They were never regarded as generational pitching prospects like Paul Skenes the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft who debuted Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park. Woodruff was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs seven times between July 2017 and July 2018 an example of the roster management that showed Counsell’s dexterity during Milwaukee’s rise.

“He has an excellent track record” Brown said mentioning Josh Hader Devin Williams and Freddy Peralta by name. “There are some really good arms that Craig really helped develop.”

As a rookie in 2018 Burnes went 7-0 with a 2.61 ERA in 30 appearances out of the bullpen a midseason boost that helped the Brewers force a Game 163 at Wrigley Field and take away a division title from the Cubs. Burnes split the next season between the majors (8.82 ERA) and Triple-A San Antonio (8.46 ERA). His name then appeared in the Cy Young Award voting in each of the next four years and he won the award in 2021.

Progress as Cubs executives like to say isn’t always linear. Brown spent a month-plus on the injured list with a strained left oblique and finished last season working out of Iowa’s bullpen. He needed those reminders when his development stalled.

“Corbin Burnes went through that one funky year before he ended (up) going off for a Cy Young ride” Brown said. “Woodruff was a little bit of a late bloomer as well. There’s the (Jacob) deGroms of the world who didn’t debut until he was (almost) 26. Last year with my frustration I was like ‘Hey there’s still hope for me to be a good baseball player one day.’”

Brown’s self-awareness and dedication to his craft should help him continue to make adjustments. He has a 2.84 ERA in four starts and four multi-inning appearances as a reliever. His fastball velocity (96.5 mph) is elite. His strikeout rate (25.8 percent) is above average on a staff that doesn’t have that much classic swing-and-miss stuff.

Brown’s personality traits will also likely keep him in Counsell’s circle of trust. It’s not like the Cubs are going to suddenly get healthy. Before Saturday’s game in Pittsburgh the team placed reliever Yency Almonte on the 15-day injured list with a strained right shoulder and recalled right-hander José Cuas from Iowa. Whatever Counsell needs Brown will be available.

“It’s all good” Brown said. “Put in the time. Put in the work. And try not to worry too much about going down or whatever. It’s been awesome.”

Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control.

Actress Yvette Nicole Brown 52 and her fiancé Anthony Davis found love with each other when they weren’t looking. The couple who announced their engagement in December 2023 discussed their relationship and upcoming wedding on Getting Grilled with Curtis Stone. During the interview Brown encouraged women who are waiting for partners not to settle.

“To be my age to be single as long as I was single and to have waited — you know I didn’t just grab a guy I waited until I found the guy my heart loves that’s a testimony and that’s also aspirational and inspirational to women that are in my position” Brown told Stone during their chat.

She continued “I would love for a 40-something or a 50-something woman to see this story and go ‘Okay it’s right for me to wait for the right one or to not just marry whoever asks me first if I don’t feel it.’ It is still possible.”

While the actress is open to sharing her story she still wants to be intentional about retaining a level of privacy.

“So now I’m trying to thread the needle about how much do I share to encourage people without giving away what is special and important to me?” Brown asked.

The couple met initially when they were in their 20s while in an acting class at church and reconnected in recent years. Brown said she wasn’t actively looking for love but clearly love was looking for her. They were platonic friends and then things blossomed organically according to the actress.

“In life sometimes things happen and you think ‘Okay I’m done with dating. I’m not gonna deal with this anymore’ and then in comes somebody who’s pumping your heart helping you breathe and you don’t even realize it” she said.

During the interview Davis said friendship continues to be the foundation of their loving relationship. When they pivoted to talks about their upcoming wedding Brown admitted that she no longer fantasizes about an idyllic white wedding. Therefore she’s going into wedding planning a bit blind.

“I’m of a certain age and had stopped dreaming of weddings and you know I’m not one of those girls who has a vision board of ‘This is my dress.’ I did that in my 20s it didn’t happen. I was done” she said. “It’s been 30 years since I dreamed about a wedding or where I was gonna hold it or whatever so I’m clueless.”

Davis is similarly not stressing about the wedding and said he’d marry Brown whether it be “at the justice of the peace” or a fancy “vineyard.” He had one catch however when it came to the bride.

Consumers who are dissatisfied with their bank – or who think they could get better service somewhere else – may be more inclined to make a change.

But what determines a better financial institution? In its annual survey J.D. Power found that overall satisfaction among bank customers is declining especially among younger consumers.

Bank customers under age 40 and who have the highest levels of education highest income growth potential and are arguably the most desirable customer segment in the banking industry appear to be the least satisfied. The survey found that overall satisfaction with banks is down four points from 2021 and has fallen nine points since 2020.

Paul McAdam senior director of banking services at J.D. Power says banks appear to be falling short of expectations when it comes to branch service new customer onboarding and resolving customer complaints.

“As a result we’re seeing young well-educated high-income customers driving a steady decrease in customer satisfaction” McAdam said. “This is a clear warning sign for banks because key metrics like intent to reuse the brand and customer perception of having a relationship with the brand are also in decline suggesting a future erosion of new business these customers will bring to their banks.”

While rankings tend to be lower for all banking institutions three are holding onto customer support. Capital One ranked highest for a third consecutive year with an overall satisfaction score of 694 on a 1000-point scale. Chase was second with a score of 678 and TD Bank ranked third with a score of 663.

What ConsumerAffairs reviewers say

We decided to find out how ConsumerAffairs reviewers view the service they receive from banks. We not only looked at verified reviews of those three institutions in the J.D. Power survey top three but also included Bank of America and Wells Fargo two major banks providing consumer banking services.

The results were somewhat surprising. Among ConsumerAffairs reviewers Capital One a perennial favorite finished at the bottom though not by much. Bank of America which didn’t show up in J.D. Power’s top three led the pack.

Here’s how the five banks rank with ConsumerAffairs reviewers based on a five-star review system:

Bank of America 4-stars

Chase 3.8-stars

TD Bank 3.8-stars

Wells Fargo 3.8-stars

Capital One 3.7-stars

Customer service credit cards disputes

Capital One suffered among ConsumerAffairs reviewers who cited different issues including customer service problems with credit cards and the dispute process. Many of the low ratings were posted in recent months.

But David of New Orleans is mostly satisfied with Capital One and gave the bank a five-star rating in August.

“I've had no negative experiences and I find that customer service goes above and beyond” David wrote in a ConsumerAffairs review. “If you're deciding which bank to go with for a checking account do yourself a favor and pick Capital One.”

The J.D. Power study now in its sixth year measures the customer experience with all retail bank product lines for nine national banks in the United States.

Travel’s big comeback has translated to busier—and more stressful—airports. This in turn has prompted more fliers to seek calm within the chaos namely in the comfort of airport lounges. But with so many travel credit cards offering airport lounge access as a primary perk of being a cardholder the lounges themselves aren’t quite fulfilling promises of serenity these days. In response credit cards as well as lounges are tightening their access policies in 2023. On the flip side credit card companies are investing heavily into expanding their lounge networks to meet current demand—and giving us a lot to look forward to. Here a glimpse of the good the bad and the ugly of what’s to come in the world of airport lounges in 2023.

American Express Centurion Lounges

The Platinum Card® from American Express ($695 annual fee see rates and fees) offers the most extensive network of airport lounges of any credit card including the Priority Pass network Plaza Premium lounges Lufthansa lounges and more. The most coveted ones in the portfolio are Centurion Lounges American Express’s signature airport lounges. There are currently 13 Centurion Lounges in the United States (Charlotte Dallas Denver Houston Las Vegas Los Angeles Miami New York–LGA New York–JFK Philadelphia Phoenix San Francisco and Seattle).

Good news: The newly expanded San Francisco Centurion lounge reopened on December 31 2022 with twice the space and an additional bar and a new menu from San Francisco’s Liholiho Yacht Club Executive Chef Ravi Kapur. Later in 2023 a brand-new Seattle Centurion lounge will be triple the size of the current one boasting views of the Olympic Mountains. Also on deck for 2023 and beyond are three new Centurion lounge locations (Atlanta Newark Washington–DCA) plus a growing number of outposts internationally.

Bad news: Centurion’s guest policy is changing for the worse. As of now Platinum Card holders can enter any Centurion Lounge on their date of air travel regardless of airline flown or class of travel and with up to two guests per visit free of charge. Come February 1 2023 each guest will cost $50 (or $30 for children ages 2 through 17 with proof of age).

Chase Sapphire Lounges by the Club

In summer 2022 we reported that Chase Sapphire Reserve® cardholders could look forward to Chase Sapphire lounges in late 2022 and throughout 2023. The first lounge is officially now open—and more are on the way.

Good news: On October 25 2022 the first Chase Sapphire Lounge by the Club opened in Hong Kong airport. Soon after Chase announced that in addition to its in-progress lounges in Boston Las Vegas New York–LGA Phoenix San Diego and Washington–IAD plans are in the works for a 20000-square foot lounge at Philadelphia in the airport’s Terminal D/E connector.

Bad news: The entire new network of Chase Sapphire Lounges by the Club will be part of the Priority Pass network. Chase Sapphire Reserve provides cardholders with Priority Pass Select membership so that means Reserve cardholders can enter. That also means all Priority Pass members will be welcome—even those who have membership through a Capital One or American Express credit card—so crowding could be an issue. (Note that a Priority Pass card is needed for entry; simply showing your Reserve card is not enough.)

Capital One Lounges Landings and Priority Pass changes

Holders of the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card can enjoy lounges in the Priority Pass network Plaza Premium lounges and Capital One’s growing network of amenity-rich branded lounges.

Good news: Capital One is expanding into the airport lounge business with its own Capital One Lounges. While there is currently only one located at Dallas–Fort Worth more are expected to open in 2023. Denver and Washington–IAD will get full-sized Capital One Lounges soon. Meanwhile Capital One Landings the credit card’s boutique chef-driven lounge concept with food and beverage by the award-winning José Andrés Group will debut at Washington–DCA and New York–LGA. Venture X Rewards cardholders enter Capital One Lounges free of charge along with two complimentary guests per visit.

Bad news: Currently Priority Pass membership obtained through Capital One grants credits at affiliate airport restaurants cafés and bars. At press time there are 29 of these lounge alternatives where Priority Pass members receive a food and beverage credit of $28 to $32 per guest. As of January 1 2023 the Priority Pass membership offered through Capital One will no longer offer credits or experience at Priority Pass’s restaurants and other lounge alternatives. (Note that Priority Pass membership through an American Express–branded credit card does not offer credits at Priority Pass’s lounge alternatives either while it does through Chase Sapphire Reserve.)

Delta Sky Clubs

Overcrowding is currently a major problem across airport lounges but the packed scenes at Delta Sky Clubs reach next level. Hence Delta is making major adjustments to lounge access in 2023 while expanding its lounge footprint in key markets.

Good news: Delta has eight Sky Club openings and expansions planned for 2023. A new club will open in Kansas City while lounges in Boston Minneapolis–St. Paul Newark and New York–JFK will move to new larger spaces. Miami and Fort Lauderdale clubs will be expanded as will the outpost in Atlanta’s concourse E. Additionally Delta will launch a real-time occupancy tracker for Atlanta and Detroit lounges in the Fly Delta app (with other airports scheduled to follow).

Bad news: Delta will be prioritizing lounge entry granting Diamond Medallion Delta 360 members and Delta One customers access first. Those with the Platinum Card® from American Express and Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card ($550 annual fee see rates and fees) will still be able to enter but we’re unsure where they’ll fall in the new hierarchy. The fee for companion guests will rise to $50 per guest starting February 2 2023 (from the current guest fee of $39). Also starting February 2 2023 those with elite status (Diamond Platinum or Gold Medallion®) will no longer receive Delta Sky Club access when flying internationally in Main Cabin or Delta Comfort+. In addition beginning February 1 2025 Reserve Card Members will receive ten visits per year to the Delta Sky Club. In order to earn an unlimited number of visits each year the total eligible purchases on the card must equal $75000 or more in 2024 and each calendar year thereafter.

American Airlines Admirals Clubs

American Airlines is starting to give its Admirals Club lounges a full redesign with a focus on relaxation. The first one opened in October 2022 at Washington–DCA. Membership to Admirals Clubs can be bought outright for $650 annually but membership comes as a complimentary perk of the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® which has an annual fee of $450 so it makes more sense to get your club membership that way.

Good news: With other upcoming locations planned for Newark Austin and Denver these new lounges are designed to feel more residential than office-like with sustainable design elements relaxation spaces and a strong sense of place. (The DCA lounge has design elements inspired by the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial the Capitol building and the city’s famous cherry blossoms.) American hasn’t provided a precise timeline for when it plans to open these other new lounge locations.

Additionally American Airlines also opened three new co-located lounges—the Chelsea Lounge Soho Lounge and Greenwich Lounge—at New York–JFK’s Terminal 8 with its oneworld partner British Airways in December 2022. To access the new JFK lounges you’ll need to be flying in first or business class on a qualifying American British Airways or oneworld Alliance airline flight or hold a specific status with those airlines.

Bad news: There really is none! American is keeping its lounge access policy the same into 2023.

Glossary



Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed income investment to a change in interest rates.

Net Zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere. (United Nations)



Spread is the difference in yield on two different bonds.

Risk Considerations



Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally including credit liquidity interest rate prepayment and extension risk. Bond prices fluctuate inversely to changes in interest rates. Therefore a general rise in interest rates can result in the decline in the bond’s price. The value of securities with variable and floating interest rates are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with fixed interest rates. Variable and floating rate securities may decline in value if interest rates do not move as expected. Conversely variable and floating rate securities will not generally rise in value if market interest rates decline. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will default on payments of interest and principal. Credit risk is higher when investing in high yield bonds also known as junk bonds. Prepayment risk is the risk that the issuer of a security may pay off principal more quickly than originally anticipated. Extension risk is the risk that the issuer of a security may pay off principal more slowly than originally anticipated. All fixed income investments may be worth less than their original cost upon redemption or maturity.

Environmental Social and Governance (“ESG”) strategies may take risks or eliminate exposures found in other strategies or broad market benchmarks that may cause performance to diverge from the performance of these other strategies or market benchmarks. ESG strategies will be subject to the risks associated with their underlying investments’ asset classes. Further the demand within certain markets or sectors that an ESG strategy targets may not develop as forecasted or may develop more slowly than anticipated.

The opioid epidemic reached staggering proportions last year driven by the unprecedented lethality of fentanyl.

According to Gov. Newsom’s office law enforcement efforts seized 28765 pounds of the synthetic drug last year enough to potentially kill the entire population of North America twice.

The 594 percent increase in seizures had an estimated street value of more than $230 million and comes as overdoses are skyrocketing.

Overdose deaths due to the highly potent synthetic opioid were up 3917% from just five years ago. Fentanyl is up to 50 times as potent as heroin and 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine according to the CDC. This makes it attractive to illicit drug manufacturers because it allows them to use smaller amounts while achieving the same effects making it more profitable and leading to a surge in counterfeit versions of other drugs actually containing fentanyl – which can be deadly in quantities as small as a few grains of sand.

Deaths were reported throughout the local region last year including Santa Monica.

“The opioid crisis has touched every part of California and our nation this year. As we mourn the many lives lost California is working harder than ever to fight this crisis and protect people from these dangerous drugs to ensure our communities are kept safe in the first place” said Gov. Newsom. “California is cracking down on the fentanyl crisis – increasing seizures making resources more available to Californians and ensuring communities have what they need to combat the immeasurable harm opioids have caused our society our communities and our loved ones.”

Officials at every level of government have worked on addressing the crisis.

The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) made millions of dollars in grants available and DHCS announced it will bolster efforts to raise awareness of the life-saving drug Naloxone by working with colleges and universities across California.

Assemblymember Matt Haney (D-San Francisco) introduced legislation that will require opioid blocker nasal sprays — also commonly known as naloxone or by the brand name Narcan — to be kept in an area accessible to employees in gas stations bars libraries and single room occupancy hotels (SROs) along with posters describing how to identify an overdose. Opioid blockers would only be required in counties experiencing an opioid crisis and would be dispersed through the mail free of charge by the California Department of Public Health.

“Stopping fentanyl from entering our communities must be a top priority for law enforcement” said Assemblymember Haney. “But fentanyl is so cheap to make and so addictive that it’s spreading at a rate that will only get worse before it gets better. We have to aggressively go after the supply but at the same time we have to immediately escalate our public health response to save lives.”

SMMUSD has long had Narcan at secondary school locations and recently discussed extending its supply to elementary schools.

Officials are also investing incredible amounts of cash in the problem. The Newsom administration has invested more than $1 Billion with CalHHS investing $450 Million in the current fiscal year.

The City of Los Angeles recently received its first $1.8 million payment as part of the blockbuster $26 billion national settlement with drug distributors McKesson Corporation Cardinal Health Inc. AmerisourceBergen Corporation and separately with manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson). LA City Attorney Mike Feuer filed the civil lawsuit in May 2018 against six opioid manufacturers and three distributors alleging fraudulent and negligent business practices that fueled the local and nationwide opioid crisis.

Additional payments amounting to $4.2 million are expected by February. Tens of millions of dollars will continue to flow into L.A. City over the next two decades to abate the opioid epidemic including potentially to assist those struggling at the nexus of substance abuse and homelessness.

“Throughout the nation and across Los Angeles the opioid crisis has shattered lives while powerful corporations watched the profits roll in. We filed our lawsuit to hold them accountable change their conduct and obtain resources to contend with the impact of this epidemic on L.A.’s streets” said Feuer. “This payment is just the beginning.”

As part of last year’s budget Governor Newsom provided additional funding to increase the California National Guard’s capacity to combat the fentanyl crisis and support federal state and local law enforcement counter-narcotic investigations and operations.

However given the quantity of drugs flowing into the state officials said more is needed.

“If fentanyl continues to be cheaper and more accessible than opioid blockers we’re going to keep seeing an increase in overdose deaths” said Haney. “Until we can cut off the source of fentanyl we have a responsibility to make sure the only effective first aid response is always there when it’s needed.”

Carvana's (CVNA -2.83%) stock hit an all-time high of $370.10 on Aug. 10 2021. Investors were impressed by the online used car dealer's robust revenue growth expanding gross margins and narrowing losses. Carvana benefited from the post-pandemic acceleration in auto sales even challenging traditional dealerships with its online platform that simplified the financing process set firm prices and enabled its customers to ""get the car without the car salesman.""

But by the end of 2022 Carvana's stock had dropped below $5 a share. Used car prices fell sharply as the vehicle shortage turned into a supply glut inflation curbed consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars and rising interest rates made it more difficult to finance those purchases. Carvana's lack of profits high debt and dwindling liquidity also made it a risky stock to own as interest rates continued to rise.

Does this beleaguered stock actually have a chance to bounce back over the next 12 months?

Carvana's biggest problems

Carvana's revenue rose 101% in 2019; grew 42% in 2020 even as the pandemic disrupted traditional dealerships; and soared 129% in 2021. But in the first nine months of 2022 its revenue only grew 19% year over year to $10.8 billion as the market's demand for used vehicles cooled off.

Carvana's gross margin expanded from 13% in 2019 to 15% in 2021 but dropped to just 10% in the first nine months of 2022 as used car prices fell. Its net loss narrowed significantly to $287 million in 2021 but widened to a whopping $1.45 billion in the first nine months of 2022.

Carvana only held $477 million in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the third quarter. It was also shouldering $9.25 billion in total liabilities -- including $6.62 billion in long-term debt. In early December Carvana's three biggest creditors which hold about 70% of its debt agreed to work together to force Carvana to restructure its debt or secure fresh financing. That rare alliance between its creditors suggests fears are rising that Carvana might seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Will Carvana run out of cash in a year?

Several analysts including Bank of America's Nat Schindler and Jefferies' John Colantuoni believe Carvana will simply run out of cash within a year if it doesn't secure new financing.

Carvana's long-term debt is currently split into five tranches maturing in 2025 ($500 million) 2027 ($600 million) 2028 ($600 million) 2029 ($750 million) and 2030 ($3.28 billion). That final tranche was issued to fund its $2.2 billion acquisition of the online used car auction website Adesa U.S. in May 2022.

Carvana still has time to get its finances in order before its first tranche of debt matures in 2025. However it's still paying high interest rates of 4.875% to 5.875% for its first four tranches of debt and 10.25% for the 2030 tranche. So the company will likely need to secure fresh funds at even higher rates as its core business deteriorates.

In the first nine months of 2022 Carvana's interest expense rose 175% year over year to $333 million and gobbled up 32% of its gross profit -- compared to less than 9% of its gross profit a year earlier. If its net losses continue to widen and its liquidity dries up it probably won't have enough cash left by the end of 2023 to fulfill its interest payments.

As of this writing Carvana's October 2025 bonds are trading at about $0.44 on the dollar implying it has less than a 50% chance of paying back those creditors. Meanwhile analysts expect Carvana to post net losses of $1.83 billion in 2022 $1.42 billion in 2023 and $1.09 billion in 2024. So it probably can't stave off a bankruptcy protection filing unless it raises a lot more cash.

Carvana is simply too risky to own

It seems unlikely that Carvana can raise enough cash at reasonable rates in this tough market. It might liquidate some of its inventories reduce the size of its workforce and implement more cost-cutting measures to slow the bleeding but its long-term prospects won't improve until interest rates stabilize and used car prices rise again.

Unfortunately Carvana's balance sheet suggests it could easily file for bankruptcy protection before those green shoots appear. On the bright side Carvana might still be bought out by a larger competitor like CarMax which is firmly profitable at a slight premium to its all-time lows. Yet investors should never invest in a broken business just because it might be acquired. Carvana might look cheap at less than 1 time next year's sales but it's simply too risky to buy as a turnaround play.",,,,,,,,,,,,

With supply chain and labor shortages plaguing the industry over the last few years numerous cruise ships set to debut in 2021 were finally launched within the last year.

Additionally many delayed and cancelled cruise itineraries finally took place in 2022 including my much-anticipated Israel cruise on Royal Caribbean’s Odyssey of the Seas.

I was also fortunate enough to sail on Carnival Cruise Line's newest ship Carnival Celebration during one of the ship’s inaugural voyages. This brand-new ship for Carnival Cruise Line is the second ship in the fleet’s new Excel-class.

Image

Along with Carnival Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration is a completely redesigned amplified cruise ship for the cruise line. Holding 40% more passengers than any other ship in Carnival’s fleet the new Excel-class exemplifies a more modern open and innovative approach to cruising.

Image

Carnival Celebration was unlike any Carnival ship I’ve sailed on before - the new ship was trendy sleek and stylish. The spaces onboard didn’t feel crowded or cramped.

Additionally the incredible entertainment numerous dining options and functional staterooms were all part of Carnival's revamped ship design; these design changes created a more upscale experience while still maintaining that ‘fun’ Carnival branding at its core.

Image

With so much excitement in 2022 I am already looking forward to what 2023 will bring to the cruising industry. You can anticipate ships that are bigger and better than anything built before!

Here are the exciting sailings I am looking forward to the most in the coming year.

Image

Carnival Jubilee is set to launch next year as the third cruise ship in Carnival Cruise Line’s wildly successfully Excel-class

Similarly built to Carnival Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration the newest ship Carnival Jubilee will launch in 2023 for Carnival Cruise Line.

This brand-new Carnival cruise ship is named after the cruise line's original Carnival Jubilee which was retired and scrapped in 2017 after nearly 30 years of service.

The referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.

For years Carnival Cruise Line resisted cruise industry trends of building mega ships that rivaled floating vacation resorts. All of that changed with the debut of the Excel-class when the cruise line started building ships that were bigger and better than anything the cruise line had designed before.

Mardi Gras the first ship in the class introduced a ton of firsts for the cruise line including Emerli's Bistro 1396 Emeril Lagasse's first-ever restaurant at sea; Street Eats three open-air stalls that are meant to remind passengers of the food truck phenomenon; and redesigned staterooms that feature showers with glass doors. So long curtain!

Following the success of its sister ships Carnival Jubilee is a highly anticipated addition to Carnival’s growing fleet. For instance guests can expect to find Bolt the industry’s only rollercoaster at sea that first debuted on Carnival Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration.

Image

Excel-class ships have designated zones - each with their own flair. For instance Carnival Mardi Gras has a French Quarter zone that is themed after New Orleans while Carnival Celebration has The Gateway which is a travel-inspired zone in the ship’s center.

Image

Guests can expect to find two zones that are specifically catered to Carnival Jubilee although these have yet to be released by the cruise line.

Sailing from Galveston Texas Carnival Jubilee will be the biggest Carnival ship to sail from Texas - holding around 5400 passengers. Excitement certainly surrounds expanded areas of Carnival favorites such as the two-story RedFrog Tiki Bar and maximized Guy’s Burger Joint.

Image

The inaugural sailing for Carnival Jubilee is slotted for late December 2023. Carnival Jubilee’s December debut is delayed from the initial scheduled launch date for October 2023 because of shipyard delays.

Sailings on Carnival Jubilee include Western Caribbean ports like Cozumel and Costa Maya.

Celebrity Ascent will launch in 2023 following the success of sister-ships Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Beyond

Following the heels of Celebrity Edge Celebrity Apex and Celebrity Beyond the cruise line plans to debut its fourth ship in the new Edge-class in 2023 - Celebrity Ascent.

Image

Similar to Celebrity Beyond which debuted in 2022 Celebrity Ascent will be larger than earlier Edge-class ships to accommodate expanded venues onboard. Standing one deck taller and 20 meters longer Celebrity Ascent will follow Beyond’s lead with an expanded Sunset Bar on the ship’s aft which was one of our favorite spots on Celebrity Beyond.

Image

The expanded deck space also creates more room for a larger Rooftop Garden Grand Plaza and suite-only Retreat area.

Having more space onboard also allows for more staterooms with Celebrity Ascent having 12% more staterooms than Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Apex.

Image

Celebrity Ascent will also feature two new cantilevered floating pools on its top deck along with the ever-so-popular Magic Carpet. This floating bright-orange venue off the side of the ship serves multiple purposes. By day the Magic Carpet is a tendering launch through Destination Gateway and transforms to a nightly bar on the top deck.

Image

Slotted to debut in December 2023 Celebrity Ascent will sail from Fort Lauderdale for Caribbean sailings. During the summer 2024 season she will sail from Europe to places like Italy France Spain Greece and Turkey!

In 2023 MSC plans to debut its first-ever luxury exploration ship Explora 1 which will offer destination-focused itineraries

While MSC has been building some of the cruise industry’s largest ships the cruise line also plans to enter into the luxury cruise liner industry next year. Rather than catering to the mass cruise market MSC is creating an entirely new cruising segment under the MSC brand.

Image

With Explora Journeys MSC hopes to offer destination-focused itineraries that allow guests to string together multiple sailings to create one extended journey onboard a luxury vessel.

Each itinerary is unique with no repeats on the ship’s schedule which also includes extended stays in some ports to create a slower-paced itinerary. Simply put there are no roundtrip sailings planned for Explora Journeys with MSC.

Image

The new cruising segment for MSC aims to attract not just people who prefer to take luxury cruises but also to tap into the luxury travel segment as a whole. Holding right around 1000 passengers Explora 1 is considered a larger luxury vessel for cruising standards.

Explora 1 was designed similarly to an upscale resort so you also won’t find big restaurants onboard the new luxury exploration ship; instead MSC wants to focus on creating intimate upscale venues.

Image

Explora 1 will debut first in Europe for the summer of 2023 before repositioning to North America in the winter; this new luxury cruise ship will be the first of six ships in the Explora Journeys ship class for MSC. The rest will be launched between 2024 and 2028.

Resilient Lady the third ship for Virgin Voyages will continue shaking up the cruise industry with its trendy and unique approach to cruising

Originally scheduled to launch in 2022 Resilient Lady will finally debut in 2023 after nearly a year of delays.

Image

Similar to Virgin Voyages’ other ships Scarlet Lady and Valiant Lady the start-up cruise line from Richard Branson has been designed to rethink traditional cruising. The new Resilient Lady will be seemingly identical to its sister-ships each holding around 2700 passengers.

Image

The adult-only cruise line has introduced many industry-firsts like a tattoo parlor and drag queen bingo. Like its sister ships Resilient Lady will ditch the main dining room concept to feature non-traditional dining venues and imaginative cuisine. You also won’t find any buffets onboard Resilient Lady - or any Virgin Voyages ship for that matter. Plus all of the restaurants are included in the cost of your base fare.

Image

Resilient Lady will continue to ditch dress codes and Broadway-style shows; instead you can enjoy interactive dance parties late-night dodgeball colorful karaoke and nightclubs.

Expanding its cruising footprint Resilient Lady will be the first Virgin Voyages ship to sail to the Land Down Under. With a scheduled launch in May 2023 the brand-new Resilient Lady will set sail in the Mediterranean’s Greek Isles before repositioning to Australia for the winter where it will cater more specifically to an Aussie market and sail to ports like Napier New Zealand; Hobart Australia; and Sydney Australia.

Norwegian Cruise Line plans to launch Norwegian Viva in 2023 which will have the most outdoor deck space of any new cruise ship

With a debut scheduled for August 2023 Norwegian Cruise Line plans to rollout the second ship of its highly-anticipated Prima-class Norwegian Viva. This brand-new ship will be nearly identical to sister ship Norwegian Prima which was launched in 2022.

Image

Significantly smaller than other ships in Norwegian Cruise Line’s fleet Norwegian Viva (and sister-ship Prima) hold approximately 3200 guests onboard (compare this to the largest cruise ship in the world Wonder of the Seas which can hold close to 7000 passengers).

Despite being the cruise line's newest class of ships they are not the largest. The largest ship in Norwegian's fleet by weight is Norwegian Encore while the largest by guest capacity is Norwegian Escape which can hold an impressive 4266 passengers at double capacity.

These smaller vessels in the Prima-class will allow the ships to dock in smaller ports which will undoubtedly lead to more unique itineraries.

Image

Just because Norwegian Viva is smaller than earlier ships built by the cruise line doesn’t mean it won’t have a slew of amenities activities and entertainment options. The industry’s first go-kart track will be bigger and better than ever on Norwegian Viva.

Image

Norwegian Cruise Line also claims that its brand-new ship will boast more outdoor deck space than any other new cruise launching; additionally similar to Norwegian Prima Norwegian Viva will have more pool deck space onboard compared to any other ship in Norwegian’s fleet.

Image

The new Norwegian Viva will first sail its inaugural season in the Mediterranean before repositioning to the Caribbean next winter and sail roundtrip from San Juan Puerto Rico.

MSC World Europa will debut in the final days of 2022 - and it’s almost as big as the world’s largest cruise ship

While MSC World Europa has technically already debuted it’s so close to 2023 that we will count it in our list of ships we are excited for in 2023. The newest ship for the European-based MSC cruise line just recently debuted and made a big splash in the cruising industry.

Image

If you watched the World Cup in Qatar you might have seen the MSC World Europa on the big screen! The newest cruise ship for MSC was featured as a hotel during the FIFA World Cup before cruising on December 20 for its inaugural sailing.

The massive MSC World Europa is the first cruise ship to be built in 13 years that competes with Royal Caribbean’s enormous Oasis-class of ships. With 6700 passengers onboard MSC World Europa is only 6% smaller than Royal Caribbean’s five Oasis-class ships.

Similar to Royal Caribbean as well MSC followed suit by creating distinct neighborhoods onboard the massive World Europa. Guests can find an adults-only district entertainment promenade and a separate family-district with nearly 10 are kids facilities.

While some cruise lines -- like Virgin Voyages -- are doing away with traditional self-serve buffets MSC World Europa will feature three different buffets that each feature their own unique ambiances and offerings. The ship is obviously massive with 13 different dining venues 6 pools and 14 hot tubs.

Royal Caribbean’s Serenade of the Seas will set sail on the cruise line’s first Ultimate World Cruise in 2023

If time and money were unlimited in my life (and perhaps I could bring my dogs) you could expect to find me on Royal Caribbean’s Ultimate World Cruise.

This incredible sailing will take place over 274 nights on Royal Caribbean’s Serenade of the Seas. Although this isn’t a brand-new ship by any means (she set sail in August 2003) this grand voyage is newly offered by Royal Caribbean International. The cruise line has never offered any type of extended cruise journey with a heavy focus on global destinations.

Image

During the Ultimate World Cruise guests onboard Serenade of the Seas can visit world wonders like the Great Wall of China Iguana Falls the Taj Mahal Machu Picchu. Other unique countries on the itinerary include India Bulgaria Romania Ukraine Antarctica and Morocco.

There are even over 40 ports of call that are rarely available on other itineraries or are brand new to Royal Caribbean!

Image

This unforgettable journey will set sail in December 2023 visiting 60+ different countries and 11 world wonders. Technically this world cruise starts and ends in Miami Florida and takes place throughout most of 2024.

Guests can also opt to take certain segments of the itinerary if the entire 274-nights aren’t feasible each of which lasts a minimum of 60 nights and visits at least 36 different destinations.

The Ultimate World Cruise will cost you a pretty penny though. The entire voyage starts at $59k per person for an inside cabin while one of the individual four segments cost around $12k-$16 per person.

However you do get certain perks that make the fare a bit more inclusive like a Deluxe Beverage Package wash and fold laundry service included gratuities and Voom internet. Plus if you are able to sail on the entire voyage you'll get even more -- think round trip business airfare and a pre-cruise hotel and gala.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWRhaWx5LWdyYXR1aXRpZXMtaW50ZXJuZXQtaW5jcmVhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Daily Gratuities and Internet Increase in 2023,"On the heels of Norwegian Cruise Line increasing its daily gratuities by 20 percent Carnival Cruise Line is the latest cruise operator to institute a hike. In a letter to booked guests Carnival revealed it would be increasing both the daily gratuities and internet prices.

Fun Hub onboard a Carnival Cruise Line ship.

The letter from Carnival’s Sr. Vice President of Guest Operations opened with “We are writing to let you know that we will be adjusting internet prices and onboard gratuity guidelines with all cruises based on the schedule below.

However we will honor existing prices for pre-paid internet purchases and pre-paid gratuities per the dates outlined below.”

New Carnival Daily Gratuities

Gratuity guidelines effective with embarkations beginning April 1 2023 will be as follows:

Standard staterooms: $16 per guest per day. Currently the rate is $14.50 per guest per day.

Suites: $18 per guest per day. The current rate is $16.50 per guest per day.

New Carnival Internet Prices

As for Carnival’s internet prices the new rates that will go into effect with embarkations beginning January 16 2023 are as follows:

Social: $12.75 per day. Currently $10.20

Value: $17 per day. Currently $14.45

Premium: $18.70 per day. Currently $17.00

Guests who purchase the internet package and gratuities before the rate hikes can lock in at the current prices.

The letter to guests concluded by saying “As a reminder unless they are pre-paid recommended gratuities are automatically added to your onboard Sail & Sign account as a convenience. However while on board you are free to adjust gratuities at your discretion. No adjustments will be made after the cruise. Our shipboard team members work hard to provide exceptional and friendly service so we hope you will agree that this slight increase is well deserved.”

The last time Carnival Cruise Line increased gratuities was on May 1 2022.

Guests who pre-pay for these charges can still take advantage of lower rates for these significant increases.

Carnival Gratuity Rates Increasing

Gratuities the service charges that go to reward hard-working crew members including dining staff and stateroom attendants are being increased for all stateroom categories effective from April 1 2023

For all embarkations on or after that date the rate for standard staterooms – interior cabins ocean views and balconies – will be $16 per guest per day up from $14.50 an increase of roughly 10% per day.

Suite guests will begin paying $18 per guest per day instead of the current rate of $16.50 an increase of 9%. Carnival Cruise Line last raised gratuity rates in May 2022 making this adjustment the second increase in less than one year.

While many cruise travelers agree that crew members deserve gratuities for their hard work and the special efforts they make to ensure guests have a great cruise two increases in just 11 months is significant especially when this second increase is much larger.

Prior to May 2022 the gratuity rates were $13.99 per person per day for standard staterooms and $15.99 for suites. The 2022 increase amounted to just a 4% increase for standard staterooms and a 3% increase for suites.

Put another way for a family of four enjoying a 7-night cruise gratuities in early 2022 would have equaled $391.72 for a standard stateroom and $447.72 in a suite. After the coming increase on April 1 the same family of four on a 7-night sailing will be paying $462 in a standard stateroom and $504 in a suite.

This can be a significant increase for family travel especially in a troubled economy when inflation rates are a concern. While it is true that crew members deserve the appreciation shown by a gratuity travelers will need to budget carefully for the additional expense.

These rates however are in line with recent gratuity increases announced by other lines. Norwegian Cruise Line implemented a gratuity increase as of January 1 2023 while Holland America Line is increasing gratuity rates as of February 1. Princess Cruises raised gratuity rates in mid-December.

Both Royal Caribbean International and Disney Cruise Line raised gratuity rates earlier in 2022 in September and July respectively and it is possible that additional increases may be coming for those cruise lines later in 2023.

Carnival Wi-Fi Rates Also Increasing

In addition to raising gratuity rates the prices for Carnival Cruise Line’s internet Wi-Fi packages are also being increased at an even faster rate with new prices effective from all embarkations as of Monday January 16 2023.

Carnival offers three different internet packages – the social value and premium plans. The social plan includes only social media and airline website access.

The value plan also includes email and a variety of news entertainment sports weather banking and finance websites. The premium plan has faster access speeds and supports apps like Zoom Skype and video calling where coverage permits.

The social plan will be increased to $12.75 per day up from $10.20 (+25%) while the value plan is increasing from $14.45 to $17 per day (+17%). The premium plan already the most expensive option is also increasing but at a slightly lower percentage. As of January 16 the price will be $18.70 per day up from $17 (+10%).

In an era where many travelers enjoy staying connected to share their vacation adventures on social media or with family and friends back home Wi-Fi access is critical and these price increases are relatively steep especially for a family with multiple devices to connect. Furthermore trouble with connectivity and internet speeds can make such high costs even less appealing.

On its Wi-Fi connectivity page Carnival Cruise Line recommends turning off background app data services and updates to improve connection speeds when using its internet plans but notes that “internet speed may vary depending on location and time of day.” Once an internet plan is purchased and activated onboard no refunds will be given.

Still Time to Save

Guests who opt to pre-pay for either gratuities or internet packages prior to the effective dates can still take advantage of the lower rates but after January 16 for internet packages and April 1 for gratuities the higher rates will automatically apply.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2NydWlzZS1saW5lcy1hcHBlYWwtdXMtY291cnRzLWJpZy1hd2FyZC1vd25lci1oYXZhbmEtZG9jay0yMDIzLTAxLTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise lines to appeal U.S court's big award to owner of Havana dock,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/cruise-lines-appeal-us-courts-big-award-owner-havana-dock-2023-01-03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2NydWlzZS1saW5lcy1hcHBlYWwtdXMtY291cnRzLWJpZy1hd2FyZC1vd25lci1oYXZhbmEtZG9jay0yMDIzLTAxLTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The CSG is now likely heading home after its brief Western Pacific patrol. Meanwhile Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been transiting the Miyako Strait from the East China Sea into the Pacific and returning the same way on Sunday and Monday according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense.

Comprised of carrier CNS Liaoning (16) guided-missile cruisers CNS Anshan (103) and CNS Wuxi (104) guided-missile destroyer CNS Chengdu (120) frigate CNS Zhaozhuang (542) and fast combat support ship CNS Hulunhu (901) transited the Miyako Strait from the East China Sea into the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 16 and then began flight operations in the Philippine Sea. Japan’s Joint Staff Office (JSO) of the Ministry of Defense said the CSG had sailed northward through the Miyako Strait into the East China Sea on Sunday. The release also included the following table of sightings of the Liaoning CSG from December 28-31.

Time and Date Location Ships sighted Wednesday 8pm 28 December 224 miles east of Oki Daito Island Carrier Liaoning cruiser Wuxi destroyer Chengdu fast combat support ship Hulunhu Thursday 8am 29 December 192 miles northeast of Oki Daito Island Carrier Liaoning cruiser Wuxi destroyer Chengdu fast combat support ship Hulunhu Friday 8pm 30 December 330 miles east of Kita Daito Island Carrier Liaoning cruisers Anshan and Wuxi destroyer Chengdu frigate Zhaozhuang fast combat support ship Hulunhu Saturday 8pm 31 December 137 miles south of Oki Daito Island Carrier Liaoning cruisers Anshan and Wuxi destroyer Chengdu frigate Zhaozhuang fast combat support ship Hulunhu

From Wednesday to Saturday Liaoning conducted flight operations with about 20 launches and recoveries of fighters and around 40 take-offs and landings of helicopters from the carrier. Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) fighter aircraft were scrambled in response to the fighter activity from the carrier. The release added that an approximate total of 320 take-offs and landings of both fighters and helicopters had been carried out between December 17th to 31st. Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyer JS Ariake (DD-109) replenishment ship JS Towada (AOE-422) along with a JMSDF P-3C Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft of Fleet Air Wing 5 based at Naha Air Base Okinawa monitored the PLAN CSG according to the release.

The JSO said on Sunday a Chinese WZ-7 Soaring Dragon unmanned aerial vehicle flew in from the East China Sea through the Miyako Strait and after reaching the Pacific Ocean in an area south of the Sakishima Islands it reversed course and returned to the East China Sea via the Miyako Strait. The release stated that JASDF fighters had been scrambled in response to the UAV’s flight and this was the first time that the WZ-7 UAV had been sighted operating around Japan. On Monday a release by the JSO said a WZ-7 UAV flew in from the East China Sea and that the UAV followed the same flight route as the one on Sunday and that JASDF fighters were scrambled in response.

The WZ-7 UAV which has been in service since 2018 is a high-altitude long-endurance UAV with a similar profile and mission as the U.S. RQ-4 Global Hawk though the Soaring Dragon’s range and endurance are less than the Global Hawk. The Miyako Strait is a 155-mile-wide passageway between Okinawa and Miyako Island which are considered international waters and airspace Chinese military ships aircraft and UAVs transit regularly through it from and to the East China Sea with Japan’s military shadowing their movements owing to their proximity to Japan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbG9hZHN0YXIuY29tL2V0aWhhZC1jYXJnby1mbGllcy1oaWdoLXN1cnBhc3Npbmctb3BlcmF0aW9uYWwtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtdGFyZ2V0cy1pbi0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Etihad Cargo flies high surpassing performance targets in 2022,"By LoadstarEditorial 01/02/2023

PRESS RELEASE

Etihad Cargo has achieved 80.5 per cent OTP for freighter departures and 84.1 per cent OTP for freighter arrivals ahead of its 80 per cent target

The carrier surpassed its 85 per cent DAP target achieving 86.6 per cent

PharmaLife performance continued to outpace previous years driven by the launch of new product features a commitment to world-class standards and the establishment of Pharma Corridor 2.0

6 per cent more horses were moved via the carrier’s SkyStables product compared to the previous year

The carrier received 25 awards in 2022 in recognition of its operational performance and contribution to pharmaceutical transportation innovation sustainability and CSR within the air cargo sector

Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates – Etihad Cargo the cargo and logistics arm of Etihad Aviation Group exceeded its operational performance targets in 2022. The carrier achieved 80.5 per cent on-time-performance (OTP) for freighter departures and 84.1 per cent OTP for freighter arrivals ahead of its 80 per cent target.

The carrier has also maintained a delivered-as-promised (DAP) rate of 86.6 per cent a 2.6 per cent improvement compared to the previous year and over its target of 85 per cent.

Martin Drew Senior Vice President – Global Sales & Cargo at Etihad Aviation Group said “Having achieved record revenue results in the first half of 2022 the focus for Etihad Cargo was building on this momentum to ensure the carrier continued to meet customers’ capacity demands with agility. Exceeding OTP and DAP targets which measure the carrier’s ability to deliver cargo at the agreed time and the punctuality of its freighter fleet against schedule demonstrates Etihad Cargo’s strong commitment to reliability building trust and being the air cargo partner of choice.”

2022 saw Etihad Cargo retire the last of its aircraft reconfigured to carry cargo-in-cabin. While a surge in passenger demand impacted capacity Etihad Cargo maintained a strong belly-to-freighter load factor recording a 58 per cent belly and 42 per cent freighter load mix at the end of 2022. The carrier has also achieved a load factor of 91 per cent and a freighter utilisation rate of 14.3 hours.

Etihad Cargo has also achieved growth across a number of its eight-strong premium products. The carrier’s award-winning PharmaLife product which is dedicated to the safe and reliable transportation of pharmaceuticals and life science products has achieved continuous growth despite a decrease in the movement of COVID-19 vaccines. Etihad Cargo achieved IATA CEIV Pharma recertification in 2022 demonstrating the carrier’s full compliance with specific pharmaceutical regulations in terms of Good Distribution Practices (GDP) a quality system for warehouses and distribution centres dedicated to medicines. To further strengthen connections between Abu Dhabi and the rest of the world Etihad Cargo has developed over 1330 IATA CEIV Pharma and GDP-certified trade lanes which ensure the integrity of products during transportation. The carrier’s global MOU linking Abu Dhabi and Belgium’s pharma ecosystem dedicated pharma sales team and the establishment of Pharma Corridor 2.0 also contributed to an overall increase in pharmaceutical volumes.

The carrier also moved 6 per cent more horses via its SkyStables product in 2022 compared to the previous year. Contributing to this increase was a six-month peak season for east-to-west and then west-to-east travel to coincide with major equine events and the horse-racing season. In 2022 Etihad Cargo achieved IATA CEIV Live Animals certification becoming the first airline in the Middle East and only the third globally to hold the trilogy of IATA’s CEIV Live Animals CEIV Fresh and CEIV Pharma certifications.

The expansion of Etihad Cargo’s global network was a priority for the carrier in 2022. The airline offered additional cargo capacity with the introduction of new routes and increased frequencies.

“Etihad Cargo’s customers have benefited from increased belly capacity on widebody passenger flights to key destinations including Bangkok Brussels Dublin Guangzhou Johannesburg Kuala Lumpur London Madrid New York Singapore and Vienna” said Drew. “The carrier also introduced additional freighter capacity launching new services from Chennai and Shanghai. Through continuous review of its network Etihad Cargo has responded to increased capacity demand with agility. The carrier will continue to work closely with its partners and customers so it can add capacity to meet evolving customer requirements and market conditions.”

Etihad Cargo has built depth into its network and operates services to 68 destinations around the world. Via its expansive road feeder services network the carrier further connects 132 origin stations with 290 destination stations across the UAE GCC Europe North America Japan India and Australia via a fleet of over 30000 trucks.

In addition to expanding its global footprint Etihad Cargo took strides in its digitalisation journey in 2022. The carrier further enhanced its online booking portal and launched a Mandarin version of its website and booking portal to better meet the needs of customers in China a key market for Etihad Cargo. New updates including enhanced shipment tracking automated dashboards customised news feeds and look-to-book features have resulted in 39.3 per cent of online bookings being made through the online booking portal.94.1 per cent of all online bookings in China are completed via the portal.

The carrier also reinforced its commitment to customer service excellence in 2022 launching a new CRM system for its Customer Contact Centre to empower customer service agents with more customer-focused data. Transitioning to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Pulse CRM system has provided Etihad Cargo’s customer service team with improved tools including an updated case management system and customer information such as the customer’s history purchase records sales interactions and a 360-degree view of customer queries.

Another core focus for Etihad Cargo during 2022 was sustainability and the carrier launched several initiatives and programmes that will help its customers meet their sustainability targets and benefit the wider air cargo industry. For example Etihad Cargo partnered with IATA to co-develop and trial a cargo-specific CO2 emission calculation tool which will provide a valuable proof of concept for the cargo component of the IATA CO2 Connect carbon calculator. Etihad Cargo was also the first middle eastern carrier to join TIACA’s BlueSky sustainability verification programme. To make the transportation of pharmaceuticals more sustainable the carrier entered into an MOU with B Medical Systems to develop and launch the world’s first airline-specific passive temperature-controlled container which will significantly reduce carbon emissions through an innovative design in terms of packaging type and size while still mitigating the main risks of potential breaks in the airline pharma supply chain.

Etihad Cargo’s performance and commitment to making the transportation of cargo smarter more reliable and efficient and greener have been recognised by the industry. The carrier received 25 awards in 2022 and was named cargo airline of the year by some of the sector’s most respected titles. Etihad Cargo also received awards for its contribution to the pharmaceutical transportation sector via its PharmaLife product innovation corporate social responsibility and sustainability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbGF1cmFiZWdsZXlibG9vbS8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL3JhbmtlZC10aGUtMjAtc2FmZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ranked: The 20 Safest Airlines In The World in 2023,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2023/01/03/ranked-the-20-safest-airlines-in-the-world/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbGF1cmFiZWdsZXlibG9vbS8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL3JhbmtlZC10aGUtMjAtc2FmZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9henVsLW1vc3Qtb24tdGltZS1haXJsaW5lLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Azul Named The World's Most On Time Airline For 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9henVsLW1vc3Qtb24tdGltZS1haXJsaW5lLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

This week we talked with Anita Camacho. She is the owner of Little Red Wagon Native Nursery.

About our guest

She is the President and Founder of Tampa Bay Butterfly Foundation Inc and the Tampa Bay Chapter of the North American Butterfly Association.

Anita Camacho CPA is a life-long Floridian from the Tampa Bay area. Her organizations work together to conserve butterflies monitor populations and restore/plant their habitats. Educating the public to explain the importance of our ecosystems.

My takeaways from the show

DO NOT plant nonnative milkweed. Asclepias curassavica and Calotropis giganteana are not currently considered invasive species in Florida. HOWEVER the assessment does suggest “caution” as to manage to prevent escape” for growers in South Florida. BUT They carry an overabundance of OE (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha is an obligate neogregarine protozoan parasite that infects monarch and queen butterflies.) and Tropical milkweed also has a higher concentration of cardenolides which may affect monarchs in the caterpillar stage of their life cycle.

Don’t Kill aphids on milkweed. Aphids protect the 1st and 2nd instar of monarch caterpillars. They also provide food for other insects and some birds. It is insignificant as they do VERY little damage to the plant.

Chemical usage

Don’t use chemicals. Anita found after her mother was diagnosed with Parkinson’s at 50 researched and put the chemicals associated with gardening in that era to neurological diseases. Of course she stopped using them. In just 6 months without chemicals on her roses the bushes redeveloped their natural defense mechanisms to resist diseases. Plus by planting “butterfly plants” they draw “pest insects” away from the roses.

Insects

Lots of butterflies and moths overwinter on the ground. So leave your leaf litter and be cautious when trimming as the chrysalis are brown and disappear in the landscape. ALSO we have native wild bees and most don’t have a stinger. AND they are better pollinators!

The best tree to plant is the oak. It is a keystone species that supports 600 species of animals and 90 species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).

Our butterflies (and other insects) are the

“Bell weather” of ecosystems. The more you see the better we are doing.

DON’T rear butterflies at home. The insect’s lay lots of eggs in nature to compensate for loss (eating by other creatures) and we are not professionally trained so are perpetuating diseases and weakened species.

If you want to do a couple for fun… that’s fine but “saving” every caterpillar is killing them.

Nectar Plants

Don’t forget to plant lots of nectar plants…. Not just host plants. (Lots of varieties and petal size) And remember milkweed is only a host plant to monarch queen and soldier butterfly. We have 200 species that migrate and 125 resident ones. They each have different host plants.

Passion vines host Gulf Fritillary the Zebra Longwing and the Julia.

Zebra Swallowtails need the Paw Paw and the soursop trees. Eastern Black swallowtails need parsley dill or fennel.

In fact Paw Paw trees drop leaves in winter (zebra swallowtails are gone in winter) A moth caterpillar eats the old growth from the Paw Paw which encourages new.

The zebra swallowtail caterpillars only eat fresh growth so that is where the female lays her eggs. AND the scarab beetle is the plant pollinator.

So all are needed to complete the circle of life.

So Research lots of host plants for your area.

Kenny shared that at different times of the year at dusk he gets a gathering of tiger swallowtails and zebra long-wings on trees to sleep together.

We relearned that a cluster of butterflies is called a KALEIDOSCOPE. So encourage movement and color with more insects in your garden!

Make SURE to Tune in next Monday morning at 11 for the next Sustainable Living Show. We will have Michelle James Hydroponic Tomato grower and massive garden enthusiast.

Although they begin their lives as caterpillars in time they undergo a transformation so they can sprout wings and become pollinators. Artist Levon Biss highlights the fascinating beauty of the lesser-seen stage of metamorphosis with his macro photography portraits of butterfly pupae.

Focusing primarily on Asian species of butterflies these close-up images display the variety of forms pupae take. “The butterfly pupae series is part of an ongoing project that explores the diversity of design in nature” Biss explains to My Modern Met. “When the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating it becomes a pupa. Pupae are usually immobile and are largely defenseless. To overcome this pupae often are covered with a cocoon of varying design and texture to conceal themselves in the environment.”

In this series alone we see cocoons in all shapes and colors. Some resemble fallen brown leaves in their earthy tones and uneven texture while others look remarkably like lush green foliage. There are examples that also sport bright shimmering colors and bold patterns perhaps to ware off potential predators. “The pupa can be found suspended under a branch or hidden within piles or leaves sometimes they are also buried underground” Biss continues. “This stage can last from a few weeks a month or even longer. Some species have a pupal stage that lasts for two years and it may look like nothing is going on but big changes are happening inside.” Eventually the metamorphosis will come to a close and reveal the last stage of the insect's life when it finally evolves into an adult butterfly.

You can purchase prints of this series via Biss' online shop and keep up to date with his latest projects by following him on Instagram.

Plagued with vacancies the corridor is littered with empty historic office buildings that no longer meet the current market demands of new office tenants. Originally announced at the end of September Mayor Lightfoot and the Department of Planning and Development identified the bounds of eligible buildings to be those along LaSalle St stretching from W. Washington St down to W. Van Buren St.

While all of these projects would be developed privately the initiative is offering up an array of public resources to help finance the conversions. Those resources are expected to include federal tax credits Cook County property tax incentives Tax Increment Financing PACE financing Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools subject to the review and approval of relevant public agencies and the Chicago City Council. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support.

With seven buildings and nine competing proposals the potential investment lands near $1.2 billion and just over 2000 units. Here are the proposals broken down by building:

400 S. LaSalle

Starting at the south end of the corridor developer Urban Resolve has proposed to convert the six-story structure into 226 beds of student housing along with a food court fitness center and a mental health center. Formerly the CBOE Global Markets headquarters the $104 million conversion will also include an esports arena.

--

208 S. LaSalle

Heading up the block is 208 S. LaSalle which already had office floors converted into hotels including a JW Marriott and The LaSalle. Led by The Prime Group the latest plan would convert a portion of the upper floors into 84 apartments. Set to cost $130 million the new residences would be served by a dog run fitness center lounge and access to the hotel amenities.

However a competing proposal has also been submitted for the same space. A cooperation between Sims Property Development & Management and Brinshore Development would create 102 apartments in their $50.2 million proposal.

--

135 S. LaSalle

As the former home of Bank of America Chicago’s Riverside Investment & Development is looking to convert the entire 44-story building into 430 apartments. Set to run $258 million the venture would be a partnership with Blue Star Properties and the building’s owner AmTrust. The base of the building would become home to up to 80000 square feet of lobby retail restaurant event and cultural space. This site has been eyed for a potential grocery store something the area is severely lacking.

--

105 W. Adams

Also known as the Clark-Adams Building the 1927 tower has been eyed by Maven Development Group for 432 apartments on the upper 31 floors. Spending $167 million this plan would not include the lower 10 floors which are currently home to a Club Quarters Hotel and Elephant & Castle Pub.

Overlooking Federal Plaza to the east the structure is lucky enough to be one of the two buildings with competing proposals. Coming from Blackwood Group and Celadon Partners this alternate concept would spend $192 million converting the empty space into 185 units with a two-level food market and a Stockyards Coffee House at the base.

--

111 W. Monroe

Overlooking the corner of W. Monroe St and S. Clark St developers Prime Group and Capri Capital Partners are seeking to create 349 apartments with 105 of them set aside as affordable. Previously the headquarters of BMO the 1974 structure would also see the addition of a hotel on the lower seven floors plus a spa rooftop pool and restaurant all adding up to a $180 million conversion.

--

30 N. LaSalle

With the building’s owner AmTrust currently going through a foreclosure suit on the property developers Golub & Co. and investor American General Life Insurance are looking to convert the 43-story tower into 432 apartments. Set to run them $186 million the building would have new ground-floor retail space as well as green spaces and seating along its street frontages.

--

170 W. Washington

Ending our breakdown at the northern end of the district this final proposal also happens to be the smallest. Building owners restaurateurs and businessmen Scott Cochrane Kevin Killerman and Carmen Rossi are looking to convert the building into four apartments with new ground-floor retail and commercial spaces with them likely including a restaurant of their own. Built in 1930 the plan to convert the five-story building is expected to cost about $2 million.

With these nine proposals submitted the city will now review them to determine their feasibility and to decide how much TIF funding if any they will allot. Currently the LaSalle Central TIF district is reported to have $197 million in funds available. The city plans to announce the first winners in a few months and construction could commence as soon as 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However that was only the beginning.

Spanning nearly 300 acres Hollywood Park is the largest urban mixed-use development under construction in the Western United States. Developer and Rams owner Stan Kroenke’s vision for the site when completed will offer new apartment residences public parks a lake and entertainment venues anchored by a retail district and surrounded by creative office space. The long-term final buildout of Hollywood Park will include 2500 homes 900000 square feet of office space 890000 square feet of retail and a 300-key hotel. The complex has 25 acres of open space featuring a six-acre artificial lake fronting SoFi Stadium.

“We have about 15 million square feet of entitlements” said Jason Gannon managing director of SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park. “We’re in our phase one for the project which is about 5 million square feet whenever you include SoFi Stadium YouTube Theater American Airlines Plaza the NFL Media first phase of residential and retail as well.”

The mixed-use development which billions of dollars is being spent on is all linked by walkable paseos and plazas and centered on SoFi Stadium.

There are components of the project that have already come online such as SoFi Stadium which at 3.1 million square feet and the ability to accommodate 100000 fans is the largest stadium in the National Football League. YouTube Theater a 227000-square-foot live entertainment venue meanwhile opened in August 2021. NFL is also betting on the project and in 2021 relocated from Culver City to 214063 square feet within a 450000-square-foot class A office building at Hollywood Park. There is an additional 74922 square feet of studio and creative space devoted to the brand’s growing digital and programming departments.

“Within five miles of our site there’s some 900000 to 1 million people all of whom constitute a market that anywhere else would be a whole city and yet has been traditionally underserved” said Christopher Meany partner at Wilson Meany Hollywood Park’s development manager. “The real superpower of the place is the incredible cosmopolitan community that surrounds it. This is the one part of L.A. that didn’t have that social retail heart. Our project is actually about creating that.”

Residences ready

The first two apartment buildings totaling 314 units will start leasing this month. The site is entitled for up to 2500 residences.

The Residences at Hollywood Park consisting of the Crosby and the Wesley is walkable to shopping dining sports and entertainment venues and public parks within the Hollywood Park complex. The residences were designed by prominent architects Hart Howerton and TCA Architects and interior design firms Kenneth Brown Design and Redmond Aldrich Design. The Crosby with 213 units and the Wesley with 101 units will offer a collection of residences from studios to three-bedroom units ranging 700 to 1450 square feet.

“The buildings have different personalities” Janice Thacher retail and residential partner at Wilson Meany said. “The Wesley is the smaller of the two buildings. It has a cozier feel. The Crosby has a nice pool deck. Both buildings are focused on indoor/outdoor living. A lot of outdoor space roof decks terraces highly amenitized.”

Meany said that both were “nearing completion.” He did not disclose how much apartments at the Crosby and Wesley would rent for but said they would be leased at market rate. According to Rent Café the average rent in Inglewood is $2254 at an average apartment size of 772 square feet.

The Crosby’s and Wesley’s combined 314 units remain a long way off from the 2500 homes entitled at Hollywood Park.

“We’ll build out as the market demands” Thacher said. “Just depending on the pace of the leasing we’ll start focusing on future phases of residential development.”

“We are continually evaluating the residential inventory based on demand” Gannon added. “Trying to balance the amount of construction activity at the site we think it’s important to finish up our first phase of residential and get the residents here at the site and then turn to additional residential down the road.”

Retail on its way

The other element coming online soon at Hollywood Park is the retail component. The first phase of Hollywood Park’s retail district will total 500000 square feet with 320000 square feet currently under construction and scheduled to open this summer. Hollywood Park’s tenants will include South L.A.’s Peace Love Reedburg; a new location for Mid-Wilshire’s Sky’s Gourmet Tacos; a second location for family-owned Inglewood-based juice bar Antojitos Martin; a second Inglewood location for Residency Art Gallery; Three Weavers GRDN the latest venture from Lynne Weaver founder of Inglewood’s Three Weavers Brewing Co.; Cinépolis a dine-in IMAX theatre; and the first public venue of Cosm an experiential media and immersive technology company.

BCV Architecture & Interiors Architects Orange and landscape architect Studio-MLA worked on the retail design.

Meany considers the area “a retail district that will really serve as a gathering point and a regional hub for quite a wide area around us. It’s going to serve as both a neighborhood heart and the center of a region.”

Office availability

CBRE Group Inc. Executive Vice President Rob Waller and his team led by Todd Doney Bob Healey and Patrick Amos are marketing the remaining space at the NFL Media building. Of the 500000-square-foot building the top three floors are available totaling 165000 square feet.

“We are in discussions with tenants who would take the balance of the remaining space” Waller said. “It’s very exciting and I think it’s going to be great for the overall project.”

Waller said the type of tenants who have shown interest are media technology and entertainment companies.

Hollywood Park aspires to become top-of-mind for renters.

“We really feel like we’re creating a new submarket in some ways having the retail the residential the hotel the office the stadium and having all that together combined with the open areas and the walking paths it creates a tremendously unique environment for tenants” Waller said.

Waller said he enjoyed taking part in the marketing of Hollywood Park.

“It’s tremendously exciting” Waller said. “I think this is transformative for the Los Angeles area. It’s the largest mixed-use urban project in the western United States. There aren’t that many opportunities to create brand new submarkets where you have all of these things that are custom designed and purpose built and can be built in a thoughtful way that will meet the desires of the tenants of the future.”

The Inglewood impact

The project’s impact is expected to expand beyond its property line.

“The stadium project does two things. It brings people for events. But the surrounding it’s bringing permanent jobs it brings in tax revenue for the city and it brings in housing. It’s using the space very effectively” John Loper associate professor of real estate at the USC Price School of Public Policy said.

In a city like Inglewood which historically has not had a lot of big retail development it’s bringing in new opportunities.

“From a tax basis it’s going to be good for the city but also for spurring new businesses” Loper said.

Inglewood Mayor James Butts noted that the Hollywood Park complex has already become a great economic boost for the city of Inglewood.

In 2011 nine months after Butts was elected mayor Inglewood was struggling.

“It had a 7.5% unemployment rate” Butts said. “We were going to drain our reserve funds because we were upside down in our general fund by September of 2011.”

Everything has turned around with the incoming sports venues. Last year the Hollywood Park complex brought $18 to $20 million to the city in tax revenue and thousands of jobs.

“What this project has done along with the Forum it’s produced sales tax parking tax and an increase in property tax revenue for the city” Butts said. “The construction phases of both projects had 35% local hire goals built into the agreement. The SoFi project alone had 3200 people a day come to work there 35% of them were Inglewood residents. Pre-pandemic it dropped our unemployment to 4.7%. We went from probably the highest in the state to one of the lowest unemployment rates for a minority-majority city in the country.”

SoFi Stadium has created 30000 jobs in the various phases of construction and before Hollywood Park is completed it will create 50000 to 60000 jobs over its build out Butts said.

“One of the things that’s been very important to us whether it’s during the construction phase or during the operation of Hollywood Park as a whole is to have a positive local impact on the community” Gannon said. “You look at it in terms of sales tax that’s being generated but also the job creation and economic development. We had over $750 million worth of contracts that were awarded to local minority business owners. We have over $120 million of contracts awarded to local Inglewood businesses during the construction of SoFi Stadium. Those numbers have continued to increase as we brought on board our residential and retail contractors. That’s not only during the construction phase but also the operation of the stadium and Hollywood Park.”

Businesses quintupled

While some believe that having a sports entertainment center is detrimental to small businesses “we found the opposite to be true” Butts said. “Our request for business license permits for small businesses have quintupled over the last three years. Our sales taxes have grown enormously including the portion associated with small businesses.”

Butts noted the ripple effect of companies and organizations setting up shop in Inglewood.

“Because we have that stadium we attracted the attention of the L.A. Philharmonic” Butts said. “The Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles — 35000 strong — they left Marina del Rey to come here. The NFL Network left Culver City to build a 455000-square-foot building here. YouTube came here and partnered and opened the YouTube Theater. Showtime leased 110000 square feet in the north end of the city. Nike and Dwight Howard have invested in our parks. The Dodgers Field of Dreams program which is going to renovate 75 baseball fields in the county five of those renovations will occur in Inglewood. Two of them have been done already.”

The city of Ingelwood did not pay any incentives to the developer of Hollywood Park. All of the capital was raised by Kroenke and his group.

“The only thing we will pay for and we haven’t paid yet are legitimate city costs but we didn’t pay any of the development costs” Butts said.

Butts does not see any issue with traffic produced by those attending events at the 70000-seat SoFi Stadium the 17505-seat Kia Forum and the upcoming Intuit Dome which will have 18000 seats.

Gannon considers competition from neighboring stadiums as a positive.

“Anytime you bring these types of venues with the events they have whether it’s the Forum to the north or the Clippers at the new Intuit Dome to the south that opportunity to increase traffic at Hollywood Park for our retailers” Gannon said.

Butts said systems will soon be in place to alleviate traffic. “We have an intelligent traffic system now it’s called the ITS it was funded by the project and Los Angeles World Airports (the city department that owns and operates Los Angeles International) to coordinate our signals with Los Angeles along Century Boulevard and Manchester (Boulevard). So we have more technological resources than we did before.”

Moving people

There is also the upcoming People Mover project.

“We’re also putting together the money for $1.4 billion transit connector to connect the T Line station at Florence and Market Street to travel above Market Street above Manchester above Prairie (Avenue) with stops for the venues” Butts said. “It would move about 12000 people an hour and have a dramatic impact on traffic because what it would do it would change the concept of the Metro lines from an esoteric thing that’s nice for people who don’t have cars to a must-have for people who want to get to this entertainment district.”

Butts outlined the possibilities once the People Mover comes together.

“You could fly straight into LAX get on the People Mover have it take you to the K line take it to the Inglewood transit connector go to see your game get back on the transit connector go back to the airport” Butts said.

The goal is to complete the People Mover project by 2026 or 2027 in time for the 2028 Olympics which will hold its opening and closing ceremonies at SoFi Stadium. SoFi Stadium hosted Super Bowl LVI last year. Inglewood also has Wrestlemania and NCAA football coming to the city this year the Clippers next year and the World Cup in 2026.

“There’s only three cities in the history of this country that have had so many events and so many sports teams and that’s San Francisco New York and Los Angeles” Butts said. “But what we’ve done in seven years took them a generation.”

“The most exciting part for me is just the dynamic of the fluid nature of the project as we’re going from events … to opening up retail spaces and having office users here on site throughout the year” Gannon added. “The Hollywood Park development is the largest urban mixed-use development under construction west of the Mississippi and to be a part of that every day and watch it change every day is exciting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcmVidXNpbmVzc29ubGluZS5jb20vY2JyZS1uZWdvdGlhdGVzLTIzLTdtLXNhbGUtb2YtZ3JlZW50cmVlLXBsYXphLWluLWV2ZXJldHQtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CBRE Negotiates $23.7M Sale of Greentree Plaza in Everett Washington,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcmVidXNpbmVzc29ubGluZS5jb20vY2JyZS1uZWdvdGlhdGVzLTIzLTdtLXNhbGUtb2YtZ3JlZW50cmVlLXBsYXphLWluLWV2ZXJldHQtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EBD570>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Long Beach-based Scan Group a senior health care nonprofit and Portland Oregon-based CareOregon a managed care nonprofit have agreed to merge under the new name HealthRight Group.

The merger which was announced last month is intended to give both nonprofits more clout in a marketplace for government-funded health care programs increasingly dominated by for-profit managed care providers such as Long Beach-based Molina Healthcare Inc. and St. Louis Missouri-based Centene Corp. parent of Woodland Hills managed care provider Health Net. The deal is expected to close sometime this year. Scan Group which has about 1600 employees is the parent company of Scan Health Plan which had revenue of around $3.6 billion in 2021. It has about 275000 members mostly in California but also in Arizona and Nevada. In December Scan started enrolling people in Texas.

CareOregon has been focused on providing managed care for low-income individuals through government subsidy programs especially Medicaid. It’s similar to Westlake-based L.A. Care which provides health care for the nearly 25% of Angelenos who meet low-income thresholds. It has about 515000 members with nearly 320000 of those in various Medicaid plans.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to the Dec. 14 announcement the new combined HealthRight Group entity will have revenues of about $6.8 billion and will serve nearly 800000 health plan members through its Medicare and Medicaid managed care offerings.

While the announcement did not say where HealthRight Group will be headquartered its designated chief executive Sachin Jain and board chair Linda Rosenstock currently hold those same posts with Scan Group in Long Beach. CareOregon Chief Executive Eric Hunter will retain that post and serve as president of HealthRight’s Medicaid Division.

Jain specifically referenced the aim of gaining more clout in the government-funded health care provider space.

“For far too long America’s not-for-profit managed care organizations have operated at a scale disadvantage to their larger for-profit competitors” Jain said. “HealthRight aims to bring together two complementary organizations to benefit from greater scale while maintaining focus on the people and communities they serve.”

In addition to its health plans HealthRight will operate a diversified business unit comprising assets from both organizations including Welcome Health a geriatric home-based primary care medical group; Housecall Providers an in-home primary and palliative care provider; MyPlace Health a joint venture between Scan Health and Boston-based Commonwealth Care Alliance; Healthcare in Action a medical group for people experiencing homelessness; and HomeBase Medical a medical group focused on improving chronic disease management and palliative care for Medicare beneficiaries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmdsYXcuY29tL2lwLWxhdy9hbWFyaW4tY2VudGVuZS11bml0LXNldHRsZS1wYXRlbnQtc3VpdC1vdmVyLXZhc2NlcGEtaGVhcnQtZHJ1Z9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amarin Centene Unit Settle Patent Suit Over Vascepa Heart Drug,"Amarin Corp. and an insurance provider owned by Centene Corp. have settled a patent-infringement dispute over Vascepa a treatment for heart disease and Amarin’s only drug.

When eyes are dry the cornea is more susceptible to injury. By tracking the movements of stem cells (in fluorescent green) in a mouse eye researchers were able to trace the cells as they differentiated into corneal cells and migrated to the center of the cornea providing clues about how the cells work to help corneal injuries heal.

People with a condition known as dry eye disease are more likely than those with healthy eyes to suffer injuries to their corneas. Studying mice researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found that proteins made by stem cells that regenerate the cornea may be new targets for treating and preventing such injuries.

The study is published online Jan. 2 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Dry eye disease occurs when the eye can’t provide adequate lubrication with natural tears. People with the common disorder use various types of drops to replace missing natural tears and keep the eyes lubricated but when eyes are dry the cornea is more susceptible to injury.

“We have drugs but they only work well in about 10% to 15% of patients” said senior investigator Rajendra S. Apte MD PhD the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professor in the John F. Hardesty MD Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences. “In this study involving genes that are key to eye health we identified potential targets for treatment that appear different in dry eyes than in healthy eyes. Tens of millions of people around the world — with an estimated 15 million in the United States alone — endure eye pain and blurred vision as a result of complications and injury associated with dry eye disease and by targeting these proteins we may be able to more successfully treat or even prevent those injuries.”

The researchers analyzed genes expressed by the cornea in several mouse models — not only of dry eye disease but also of diabetes and other conditions. They found that in mice with dry eye disease the cornea activated expression of the gene SPARC. They also found that higher levels of SPARC protein were associated with better healing.

“We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing to identify genes important to maintaining the health of the cornea and we believe that a few of them particularly SPARC may provide potential therapeutic targets for treating dry eye disease and corneal injury” said first author Joseph B. Lin an MD/PhD student in Apte’s lab.

“These stem cells are important and resilient and a key reason corneal transplantation works so well” Apte explained. “If the proteins we’ve identified don’t pan out as therapies to activate these cells in people with dry eye syndrome we may even be able to transplant engineered limbal stem cells to prevent corneal injury in patients with dry eyes.”"

Painting houses mowing lawns working in the pickle fields and selling agates were among some of Tom's first jobs. And who could forget the bowling alley? Managing the bowling alley in Sauk Centre as just a senior in high school opened the door for Tom's 44-year career at CenterPoint Energy (formerly Minnesota Natural Gas and Minnegasco). Tom traveled throughout Minnesota maintaining and installing bowling alleys. He learned how to manage finances provide quality customer service and work long hours. After graduating from Sauk Centre High School in 1966 Tom enrolled in the Army Reserve and went to basic training. He came home from basic training working at Kraft Foods Culligan and as an emergency responder. He then settled into his life-long career with CenterPoint Energy. Tom worked in nearly every aspect of the company-service sales management and operations. The most fulfilling role was managing the conversion of entire towns from propane to natural gas throughout central Minnesota in the 1970s and 1980s. Tom was well respected and held in high regard by his colleagues. Tom spent his retirement years doing what he loved best- spending time with and helping people. When Tom wasn't spending time with his four daughters seven grandkids and dear friends he was volunteering at Minnesota Recovery Connection. He served as a coach mentor and friend to many in various treatment centers and prisons while helping them see that they could live life fully in recovery. In the winter months Tom enjoyed his time traveling throughout New Mexico and California visiting special friends and family. Thoughtful caring present compassionate involved resilient loving and attentive are all words used by Papa Tom's grandkids to describe who he was to them. Words demonstrating a life well-lived. Papa enjoyed his years with each of the grandkids including hiking camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) fishing woodworking in the studio and attending countless school and sporting activities. In July 2021 Tom was diagnosed with a rare incurable blood cancer. While this diagnosis might have slowed him down a bit it did not change his love for life and his innate ability to be exactly the person described by his grandkids. Tom is survived by his daughters Renee Rohde (Keith) Michele (Tom) Gonyea Tonya Marthaler Angie (Greg) Berg; grandchildren Jack Emma Gina Adam Samantha Avery and Carson; sisters-in-law Gail Sandy Lois; nieces and nephews Barret Monica Chuck Jennifer Brandee and Martina and so many special friends. Tom will reunite in heaven with his parents Vincent and Elaine; brothers Jim Dale and Jack and former son-in-law Joel Peterson. Visitation will be held at Central Lutheran Church in Elk River from 2pm to 4pm on Friday January 6th 2023. Funeral services will be immediately following at 4pm. All attendees are invited a light meal at the church following the service. A private scattering ceremony for Tom's ashes will occur at a later date in the BWCA. Memorials to Minnesota Recovery Connection (minnesotarecovery.org/) or Grace Hospice (gracecaring.org/) are preferred.

Macie Kelly/Houston Public Media

The Houston area will see isolated showers and thunderstorms throughout the first Monday of 2023.

The National Weather Service is expecting a line of thunderstorms to pop up early afternoon. Winds are expected to gust at least 25 miles an hour in some spots around the city.

""There is the chance for some strong isolated severe thunderstorms"" says Jimmy Fowler meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

""They'll be more of the exception rather than the rule. The main threat from the storms will be strong gusty winds.""

A cold front could move in late Monday or early Tuesday. Temperatures are not expected to dip down into the teens for this front like the weather before Christmas. Instead the National Weather Service is predicting lows in the 40s later this week.

Fowler says if severe weather does make it's way into the Houston area it will most likely be in the overnight hours.

""If we end up have to issue any type of warnings or anything like that make sure you have a way to receive those warnings during the overnight timeframe” Fowler said. “Try not to sleep through it.""",,,,,,

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

C.H. Robinson on Jan. 3 announced the departure of CEO Bob Biesterfeld and set in motion a process to find a permanent replacement while tapping an interim leader from its board of directors.

Biesterfeld a 24-year veteran with the company took the CEO reins in May 2019. He also held the title of president and was a member of the board of directors. Prior to rising to the top post he was the company’s chief operating officer. His departure took effect Dec. 31.

C.H. Robinson said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Biesterfeld was involuntarily terminated without cause. As a result he is entitled to severance benefits in accordance with an executive separation and change in control plan.

Board chairman Scott Anderson was appointed interim CEO effective Jan. 1.

“It has been a privilege to lead C.H. Robinson and this exceptional team” Biesterfeld said in a news release. “I am proud of all that we have achieved together and it has been a pleasure working with so many talented members of the team throughout the organization during my tenure as CEO. I am confident that C.H. Robinson’s industry leading people and culture will continue to ensure that the company is well-positioned for the future.”

“On behalf of the board of directors I thank Bob for his many important contributions over the past three years as CEO and his 24 years with C.H. Robinson” Anderson said. “Since joining Robinson in 1999 Bob has played an important role in positioning C.H. Robinson for long-term success most recently leading the company through a challenging period which included COVID-19 and dealing with supply chain disruptions. We wish him all the best.”

Board member Jodee Kozlak will become independent chair of the board. Kozlak founder and CEO of consulting firm Kozlak Capital Partners has been a member of the company’s board since 2013.

“I am honored to take on the role of interim CEO and am committed to ensuring this will be a seamless transition for all C.H. Robinson stakeholders” Anderson said. “Now is the right time for C.H. Robinson to accelerate our strategic initiatives and the board is focused on identifying a CEO successor who can execute on the opportunities ahead for Robinson.”

The Biesterfeld exit “came as a bit of a surprise” Citigroup analyst Chris Wetherbee told Transport Topics. “We weren’t necessarily expecting that. Obviously results in the third quarter were not particularly good. And it doesn’t sound like the fourth quarter is progressing all that well either. So I think there is some short-term financial pressure on Bob.”

Wetherbee suggested the board of directors may believe a change of leadership is needed to achieve their longer-term goals.

“Bob I think was on the same page about executing toward more of a digital future for the brokerage platform and streamlining and cutting costs” Wetherbee said. “I just don’t know that the cost-cutting side was urgent enough for the board at this point given what’s going on in the market and results that they were seeing.”

Anderson has been a director with the company since 2012 and served as chairman between 2020 and 2022. Wetherbee believes Anderson will provide a steady hand to manage the business before a permanent leader is found.

“He has an ability to step in and be a leader right off the bat to sort of help bridge this gap between Bob leaving and whoever ultimately is being named there” Wetherbee said. But he doesn’t believe Anderson will be named to the post.

The board retained national executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates to conduct a search for a new CEO including internal and external candidates.

Wetherbee floated some possible candidates including COO Arun Rajan and board member Jim Barber.

“I think they’ll run a full process and obviously see who’s out there” Wetherbee said. “We’ll see. They’re certainly going to be looking at people though outside of executive management.”

C.H. Robinson also made membership changes to its audit and governance committees so that they remain composed solely of independent directors. It also appointed Kermit Crawford as chair of the governance committee.

One slide in particular caught his attention: “Over $500000 donated to the End Food Instability initiative.” Immediately his mind began to race with possibilities. The company had faced criticism from employees that year for not doing enough to support the local community; why not counter that narrative by sharing this number internally—and externally for that matter? Jonathan took a photo of the slide and texted it to the head of communications.

It’s the question simmering under the surface of every corporate social media post about diversity and every LinkedIn manifesto from an executive touting their organization’s latest move to become more inclusive: Is this moving the conversation forward or is this self-serving?

For every leader who’s ever publicly broadcast their own organization’s diversity equity and inclusion efforts that question raises another: What happens if someone reads your words and concludes that they’re more virtual-signaling that anything else?

In our DEI consulting work we often see accusations of virtue signaling—that is performative but ultimately empty displays of moral goodness—when there is a disconnect or lack of communication across ranks within an organization. We know that in most organizations entry-level employees tend to be the most diverse group. We also know that these employees tend to be the most vocal about things that could change or that the company could do better and we’ve witnessed how this can ruffle feathers in leadership.

These calls for change often spark anxiety stress anger and other uncomfortable emotions. Leadership might feel the urge to defend efforts taken in the past. Or they might jump to fast-paced problem solving and make a quick phone call to PR asking them to post a Black Lives Matter image on Instagram to publicly state the company’s values. Or they may back away from DEI initiatives altogether for fear of being called out again.

But this scenario—diverse new workers offering critical and fresh perspectives on workplace issues—creates the perfect opportunity for DEI growth. For example employees with marginalized identities might call for leadership to diversify its board advocate for mentors of color to help entry-level staff navigate the industry or demand that the company engage in ongoing diversity training to increase equitable practices. The company that knows how to receive this feedback is well on its way to becoming more effective welcoming and sustainable for all employees.

If however leadership responds to these calls to action without engaging in dialogue and/or really listening to recommendations they might engage in “safe” or “cheap” campaigns like an Instagram post or a company-wide email detailing the donations they’ve made. In the absence of investment in ongoing sustainable dialogues trainings and organizational change these types of one-off visible actions will likely come off as ways for the company to “check the box” while attempting to placate the marginalized team members calling for real change.

Before responding to feedback it’s important to take a step back. Pause. Breathe. Reflect. And consider this: If fixing systemic racism was as simple as posting a black square on Instagram or organizing a diversity training we would have ended it long ago. We know that a single workshop social media post or company-wide statement will not make lasting change.

So instead of thinking fast aim for endurance. In the spirit of a well-known fable: Emulate the tortoise not the hare.

When you receive feedback from employees that feedback was likely carefully thought out and thoughtfully prepared. Honor the time they spent on it and the risk they took in delivering it. Meet their investment with deep thought conversations proposed action invitations for more input and a sustained investment of effort.

Here are those steps broken down:

Deep thought: Don’t respond right away. If the message arrives via email for example take time alone in your office to read the message a few times. Notice feelings of defensiveness anger disbelief frustration. Drink some water have a snack take a 10-minute walk outside vent to someone that holds the same identities as you. Sleep on it. Return to the email after you’ve regulated your emotions and read it a few more times. Try reading it out loud with a soft tone of voice. With these steps you might be shocked at how differently it lands.

Remind yourself that when it comes to matters of race and other identities any form of feedback is a gift. Find and cultivate feelings of gratitude. Recognize that this is your chance to facilitate your employees’ experiences of feeling heard and appreciated. Consider that you have been offered a roadmap to better leadership and organizational change and it arrived in the form of an email in your inbox.

Conversations: If you have permission share the feedback with your leadership team. Guide them through the steps above modeling by leading with expressions of gratitude for the employees who shared their thoughts. Brainstorm ideas regarding what could be changed and how the company could address these concerns in thoughtful strategic and enduring ways.

Propose action: Share the ideas that were generated by leadership with the company more broadly and invite feedback via anonymous surveys optional group meetings and invitations to have 1:1 meetings. If your proposed actions are met with silence interpret the lack of engagement with caution. Silence may be a sign that your employees are feeling burnt out hopeless or skeptical that things will change. (If this is the case we recommend investing in ongoing dialogue facilitation with the help of an outside consultant.)

Invest in sustained effort and evaluation: Construct plans that have an ongoing cadence whether it’s weekly monthly or quarterly. Consider a multi-pronged approach including the following:

Conduct annual DEI and/or climate assessments

Draft company guidelines for receiving identity-related feedback and having identity-related conversations

Commit to ongoing required leadership DEI training and company-wide DEI workshops

Coordinate company reads on DEI topics

Wherever the brainstorming and feedback process leads you be encouraged and confident that you are pursuing the more promising path of the tortoise. By skillfully avoiding the alluring trap of “one and done” approaches and putting your money where your tweet is you’ve signaled that your company is prepared to persist endure and ultimately win.

In 2022 “woke” didn’t work for some of Hollywood’s biggest studios.

The Walt Disney Company Netflix Comcast and other media giants lost more than a half-trillion dollars in market value last year according to a report from the Financial Times.

In fact the market value for the Dow Jones Media Titans (DJMT) index a barometer of the financial health of 30 of the biggest media companies in the world plunged from $1.35 trillion to $808 billion a decline of about 40%.

As part of what one analyst called a “perfect storm of bad news” shares of Disney sunk by about 45% — its steepest drop in nearly 50 years — after the studio’s Avatar sequel underperformed at the box office.

Paramount and Netflix also shed 42% and 52% of their market values respectively. CNN parent company and newly-formed Warner Brothers Discovery saw its value plunge 63% the report said.

TV brands weren’t immune from the downturn either: ad revenue for AMC Networks dropped 10% last quarter along with Paramount which saw ad revenue for CBS and its other TV networks dip about 3%.

Cable providers Charter Communications (53%) and Comcast (31%) were also hard-hit with share price declines according to the DJMT index.

“I’ve been covering this sector a long time and I’ve never seen such a bad collection of data points before” Michael Nathanson media analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson told the FT.

The dismal performance for Disney comes as the once-invincible media giant is projected to lose $100 million on Strange World a sci-fi comedy with an LGBT subplot that fell short of box office expectations over the Thanksgiving holiday.

With a story about a family of explorers on a mission to save the planet from a mysterious ecological crisis Strange Worldearned less than $19 million against its $180 million budget Variety reported.

Earlier last year Disney announced its “family” streaming platform Disney+ would feature six Marvel TV series rated TV-MA meaning they include content for mature audiences.

In late November recently returned Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke at a town hall with Disney employees where he was asked about Disney's advocacy against the Florida HB 1557 under former president Bob Chapek.

Iger responded: ""I was sorry to see us dragged into that battle.""

In his talk with employees Iger vowed to work to ""quiet things down"" after the turbulence between the corporation and the state of Florida. He said the company becoming ""embroiled in controversy"" was ""distracting"" adding ""it can have a negative impact.""

In recent years Disney has incorporated more LGBT characters and “woke” storylines into its programming.

""This company has been telling stories for 100 years and those stories have had a meaningful positive impact on the world and one of the reasons they have had a meaningful positive impact is because one of the core values of our storytelling is inclusion and acceptance and tolerance and we can't lose that"" Iger said.

He added that he doesn't think ""telling stories and attempting to be a good citizen of the world"" is political.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZS1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9icm9hZGJhbmQvbmV3LXlvcmstc2hpZnRzLWdlYXJzLWludGVybmV0LWFjY2Vzcy1wbGFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York nixes Internet Master Plan based on new fiber,"New York Mayor Eric Adams has suspended the city’s Internet Master Plan creating uncertainty for New Yorkers waiting for fiber broadband and also for the vendors tapped to deploy fiber and deliver service.

T-Mobile Starry and Flume were among the 12 companies named by former New York mayor Bill de Blasio when he announced the $157 million plan in 2021. At that time de Blasio said the plan would incentivize high-quality affordable internet at scale and help reverse New York’s digital divide. He wanted to let providers use city-owned real estate to deploy infrastructure and offer service to New Yorkers at discounted rates.

Mayor Adams who was sworn in a year ago has apparently shifted the city’s focus to subsidizing end users of internet services and to educating people about the availability of broadband.

“The city has paused plans to build unified infrastructure” said Flume co-founder and CEO Prashanth Vijay. “So there are no subsidies for infrastructure but there are subsidized rates just for Spectrum and Optimum.” Spectrum and Optimum owned by Charter and Altice respectively are two of the nation’s largest cable companies and internet service providers.

“The people who get the subsidies have to have cable service” said Vijay. He said the subsidies New York is making available now are not accessible to Flume or to the other startups that expected to be part of the city’s Internet Master Plan.

“We were in Phase 2 of an RFP for unified communications infrastructure and that was essentially nixed midway through the year” said Vijay. “We had a cost effective way to bring in competition.”

Flume which launched in late 2020 with the goal of connecting at least 600000 New Yorkers leverages existing fiber and provides subscribers with last mile connections and customer premise equipment. The company operates in Connecticut and Southern California as well as in New York.

Vijay described New York’s change in plans as “a little messy” but said he is still hopeful the city will eventually invest in extending fiber to unserved homes.

For now the city’s leaders seem focused on making sure more people who have access to broadband can afford to purchase it. The city’s Office of Technology and Innovation is subsidizing up to 100% of the cost of internet for residents of select New York City Housing Authority buildings in all five boroughs.

Vijay said that in the New York buildings Flume has connected so far about 10% of the residents purchase Flume’s service. The company currently has roughly 600 active accounts in New York he said adding that 120 of those homes are connecting to the internet for the first time.

Related Flume says cities overflowing with fiber but accessibility lags

New York’s suspension of its Internet Master Plan does not mean the city has stopped investing in communications infrastructure. New York has announced no plans to cancel its LinkNYC fiber-connected 5G kiosks throughout the city. ZenFi Networks which is supplying fiber to the LinkNYC kiosks said its work is continuing and is not dependent on the Internet Master Plan.

New York’s public libraries have their own plans for neighborhood connectivity: fixed wireless access using CBRS. The libraries have secured grants totaling at least $1.5 million and have trialed CBRS access points made by Celona Baicells and Motorola. The systems integrator for the library projects is Sky Packets a company that was also named as a vendor in the now-defunct Internet Master Plan.

“What New York public libraries are doing with private wireless is truly remarkable given all the challenges a noisy wireless environment like New York presents” said David Callisch marketing director at Celona.

New York is also noisy from a political perspective and that’s the noise that is likely drowning out some of the city’s potential last-mile fiber investment at least for now.

“I’m investing on a 10-15 year timeline” said Flume’s Vijay. “Changes in administration do not give us confidence.”",,,

How to buy business insurance online

You can buy business insurance online in a matter of minutes by following these steps.

1. Figure out what policies you need

Decide what types of business insurance you need based on your business’s risks.

Most online insurance sellers make recommendations as you input information about your business. For instance if you say you have employees they’ll recommend that you buy workers’ comp.

But it’s a good idea to check your lease and any contractual agreements to see if they require you to have certain insurance policies. Your state may also require workers' compensation insurance or commercial auto insurance.

2. Get a quote

To get a business insurance quote you’ll share basic information about your business. This can include the address of any properties you own or rent how many employees you have your estimated annual revenue and your employer identification number. Then the online business insurance company will estimate how much your coverage will cost. That estimate is called a quote.

The cost of business insurance can vary widely depending on what your business does how big it is and where it’s located. Get quotes from a few different providers so you can compare costs.

To get several quotes at once try using an online insurance marketplace like CoverWallet or Simply Business.

3. Compare your options

In general business insurance policies are standardized. But they may contain different endorsements or exclusions depending on the insurance company. If you have questions about what a policy does or doesn't cover reach out to the company and ask before you buy.

Take a moment to research customer satisfaction ratings and the financial strength of the insurer too — especially if you’re buying from a company like Thimble or Huckleberry and will have to work with a different insurance company to file claims.

People should be conscious of the dangers “both economic wise leading to unemployment and the moral issues” connected to Artificial Intelligence or AI according to Catholic leaders in Nigeria.

Bishop Felix Femi Ajakaye of Ekiti on Sunday told leaders in the country to avoid legislation that would give AI the power to hurt the welfare of people in Africa’s most populous nation.

“While we approve of the good things that technology have brought to us we should be conscious of the dangers both economic wise leading to unemployment and the moral issues that go along with it” he told the congregation at St. Patrick’s Catholic Cathedral.

“We still have a high rate of unemployment in Africa by the time we allow this artificial intelligence AI to take control of us and be everywhere a lot of people and the rate of unemployment would be higher or triple or more” the bishop said.

“The artificial intelligence as we know the rate at which the technology is going a lot of jobs ordinary being done by human beings are simply being taken over by machine and if these continue there is going to be a serious rate of unemployment in Africa and other nations” he continued.

“Technology is very good but at the same time we have to be weary that God made us to know Him Love Him and Serve Him so that through this means we have the salvation of our souls. Artificial intelligence has no thinking no conscience where those two things are lacking there is danger. Otherwise the future of the world is very bleak” Ajakaye said.

“Our world is in bondage today look at the level of unemployment in Nigeria all the technological giants are reducing the workforce with AI human beings are only looking for financial gain and it is a direct affront to God. Let us raise our voice against artificial intelligence; there should be restrictions to areas where to use it. It would cause a lot of confusion in our world” the bishop said.

The Catholic Church in Nigeria dedicated Sunday the last day of World Communications Week to the discussion over AI.

The Vatican dedicated the whole Church to look at this issue when it announced last year it was dedicating World Communications Day to Artificial Intelligence.

In a statement published last year the Vatican said the evolution of artificial intelligence “makes it ever more natural to communicate through and with machines so that it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish computation from thought and the language produced by a machine from that generated by human beings.”

“Like all revolutions this one based on artificial intelligence too poses new challenges to ensure that machines do not contribute to a large-scale system of disinformation” the statement said.

The Vatican also cautioned against the risk of increasing “the loneliness of those who are already alone depriving us of the warmth that only communication between people can provide.”

“It is important to guide artificial intelligence and algorithms so that there is in each individual a responsible awareness of the use and development of these different forms of communication that go hand in hand with social media and the Internet. It is necessary for communication to be oriented towards a fuller life of the human person” the Vatican statement said.

In his homily at St. John Catholic Church in Mararaba Bishop David Ajang of Lafia said AI is transforming the world of information and communication and is “affecting everyone not just professionals.”

“We must acknowledge the excitement and confusion that comes with rapid innovation and take necessary precaution” he said.

“The Church recognizes the power of media as gifts that can foster human progress and development but also warns of their potential risks if not approached with discernment and responsibility” Ajang continued.

“Starting with the heart Pope Francis emphasizes the importance of the human heart symbolizing freedom decision-making integrity and unity. We must engage our emotions desires and dreams and encounter God in the inward place of our heart” the bishop said.

“As Artificial Intelligence advances we must not lose sight of our humanity. Rather we must engage AI with openness and sensitivity starting from our humanity and strive to become a new kind of human being with deeper spirituality freedom and maturity” Lafia said.

Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama of Abuja said people cannot run the risk of becoming rich in technology but poor in humanity.

“Our actions guided by modern technology should begin from the human heart” he said on Sunday.

“We cannot run the risk of becoming rich in technology but poor in humanity. Our actions guided by modern technology should begin from the human heart. Communication is about building relationships fostering understanding and sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ. In a world filled with noise and distractions it is essential for us to reflect on how we communicate with one another and with God” the archbishop said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tL2ZhaXRoLzIwMjQvMDUvMTIvdXRhaC1sYXR0ZXItZGF5LXNhaW50LXRlbXBsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah still 'the breadbasket of the church' – Deseret News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tL2ZhaXRoLzIwMjQvMDUvMTIvdXRhaC1sYXR0ZXItZGF5LXNhaW50LXRlbXBsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E42611E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A possible suspect was captured on security surveillance and the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office bomb squad found nothing dangerous in the packages.

The big response still shook up Sunday morning at Clearlake Baptist Church and Shield of Faith Ministries both on Minnie Street.

Pastor Richard Russ of Shield of Faith Ministries was leading service.

[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos]

“This place was really swamped” he said about the response by the bomb squad and HAZMAT teams.

Russ says at his church the package only contained graffiti.

Across the street at Clearlake Baptist Russ said the package there said it had a bomb.

A dispatcher reported over the radio getting called by the church treasurer.

“They got an envelope” the dispatcher said around 10:20 in the morning. “There’s a bunch of stuff written on the outside about a bombing and ‘I’m the donation bomber’ on it.”

On security cameras Russ showed News 6′s James Sparvero the person placing the package at the church’s door.

“And then he does the sign of the cross when he lays the package down” Russ said. “Isn’t that stupid? I mean I thought it was dumb.”

Russ said he hopes his video helps the sheriff’s office catch the person responsible.

“He could not only bring harm to himself but bring harm to other people” Russ said.

The pastor said he was not afraid of the threats.

Russ continued leading service Sunday with an evening session hours after the packages were discovered in the morning.

If you recognize the person in the surveillance contact the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

Learn about First Church of Cannabis how it started how to join,"Did you know Indianapolis has a place of worship dedicated to marijuana?

Testing the bounds of religious freedom this establishment was created to respond to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act opening its doors the same day the law went into effect.

""This is what I live by and I have more faith in this religion than any other"" Bill Levin founder of the Church of Cannabis told IndyStar in May 2015. ""This is my lifestyle. This is millions of people's lifestyle."" Here's what we know.

Indiana Marijuana LegislationCould Indiana decriminalize marijuana after a recent DEA announcement? Here's what we know

What is the Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis was founded by Levin in 2015 in response to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was signed into law by former governor Mike Pence on March 26 2015 and went into effect on July 1 2015.

When the law finally went into effect on July 1 the doors of Levin's beloved establishment opened that same day as previously reported by the IndyStar. According to the First Church of Cannabis website the group's mission is to ""celebrate life's great adventure by building on compassion good health and love.""

While the group is unable to participate in the ""holy sacrament"" of being able to light up at their regular Wednesday service they've found other ways to fill the time according to the IndyStar. A typical service starts with a shorter sermon from Levin before opening the floor to members to discuss concerns. They also perform a ""diety dozen"" with affirmations of marijuana as a means of healing. Learn more about the ""diety dozen"" here.

Where is the First Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis is located at 3400 S Rural St. in Indianapolis.

Who founded the First Church of Cannabis?

Levin 68 founder and leader of the First Church of Cannabis is a long-standing marijuana advocate who began working with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the late 19990s according to the church's website. He eventually started his own pro-cannabis organization ReLegalize Indiana.

Levin also ran for political positions as a Libertarian in the early 2010s with marijuana legislation as a key focus but came up short. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed ""Bill took this as an opportunity to establish The First Church of Cannabis on the basis of 'Cannatarian' religion where love is the most important and including the sacrament cannabis"" according to Church of Cannabis.

Marijuana Church challenges Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Levin and the Church of Cannabis filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana Pence and Attorney General Greg Zoeller in July 2015 with the claim that denying them the right to smoke in public infringes on religious freedom. A second lawsuit was filed on March 3 2016 against the city of Indianapolis the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and former Police Chief Rick Hite.

The filed suits argued that members' use of marijuana at the Church of Cannabis should be protected under Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act but was dismissed by the Indiana Court of Appeals in December of 2018.

""I feel sorry for the people who are not educated in this subject matter"" Levin previously said to the IndyStar. ""We'll keep doing what we're doing because we're doing God's work.""

In the American context this crisis is largely explained as a reflection of private and personal troubles rather than as a symptom of an unhealthy society that is plagued by extreme wealth and income inequality economic precarity loneliness and social atomization pathocracy and the culture of cruelty and a form of predatory capitalism that has financialized all areas of life fueling false needs endless consumerism and feelings of spiritual and emotional emptiness which by design can never be fully satisfied.

Sick societies thrive on damaged human relationships and also exacerbate them. Fascism authoritarianism and right-wing populism are especially prevalent in societies where a larger sense of shared social identity community belonging and meaning is endangered or in crisis.

Donald Trump's movement and the larger tendencies of American neofascism have apparently been slowed by their recent ""defeat"" in the midterm elections. But such anti-democratic tendencies in America will not be vanquished until their root causes are confronted and treated. In an essay at Counterpunch scholar Henry A. Giroux provides this context:

Under neoliberalism domination has become internalized politics has collapsed into the personal meaningful registers of the social and public sphere have largely disappeared. In this historical period of social atomization and loneliness social problems are now defined through the regressive neoliberal language of excessive individualism in which all troubles are reduced to pejorative categories such as a lack of ambition personal failings individual deficits laziness and lack of resilience.

The May 2021 American Perspectives Survey highlighted growing rates of loneliness among men in this country including the troubling fact that a majority of them report having few close friends. Over the past 30 years or so the survey found ""American friendship groups have become smaller and the number of Americans without any close confidants has risen sharply"" but men ""have suffered a far steeper decline than women"":

Thirty years ago a majority of men (55 percent) reported having at least six close friends. Today that number has been cut in half. Slightly more than one in four (27 percent) men have six or more close friends today. Fifteen percent of men have no close friendships at all a fivefold increase since 1990. Women have witnessed a friendship decline too but it has been far less pronounced. In 1990 roughly four in ten (41 percent) women said they had six or more close friends compared to 24 percent today. Ten percent of women reporting having no close friends.

A new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston indicates that American men are also leaving the labor force in increasing numbers. Since the friendship networks of men tend to be connected to their jobs this has clear mental health consequences. Fortune reports that while the U.S. job market remains ""hot"" with unemployment ""close to a 50-year low"" non-college-educated adult men continue to drift out of the workforce:

And they're leaving in part because of their perceived social status relative to better-educated men of similar age. ... Non-college-educated men have seen their pay shrink by more than 30% since 1980 compared to the average earnings of all other prime-age workers. Their weekly earnings have declined 17% while those of college-educated men rose by 20% adjusting for inflation. That earnings loss has caused a decline in their social status prompting them to walk away from work entirely Pinghui Wu the author of the study wrote. ""For many workers a job not only offers financial security it also affirms their status which is tied to their position relative to their age peers and many social outcomes"" Wu wrote.

This new report also suggests that perceptions of gender and class relations particularly for younger white men have fueled this dynamic. Younger white men were more likely to leave ""when their expected wages fell relative to their more educated peers"" and women in the workforce have generally seen their earnings increase ""irrespective of their educational qualifications"" as the effects of previous sexist discrimination begin to fade.

These findings about American men and loneliness have broad implications for societal stability and also speak to the specific appeal of fascism and other forms of illiberal politics that target and radicalize (mostly white) men who may experience a crisis of masculine identity.

It would not be correct to suggest that loneliness social atomization dislocation and related troubles are limited to any particular age race or gender. A widely read article by Paula Span at the New York Times calls attention to the growing number of ""kinless"" older Americans who do not have spouses siblings or children. The total may be close to a million people Span reports ""including about 370000 women over 75"":

Several demographic factors have fostered increased kinlessness. Baby boomers have lower marriage rates and higher divorce rates than their parents and more have remained childless. The rise of so-called gray divorce after age 50 also means fewer married seniors and extended life spans can make for more years without surviving family. In addition seniors who are Black female and have lower levels of wealth have particularly high rates of kinlessness.

Researchers are concerned that these kinless Americans are likely to die earlier and toward the end of their lives receive fewer hours of caregiving and are likelier to die alone in nursing homes. As a doctor quoted in the article observes ""Getting old is hard under the best of circumstances and even harder if you're going it alone or with weak social ties.""

Dr. Jeremy Nobel a Harvard professor and expert on loneliness summarized the health implications of loneliness in a recent interview with PBS NewsHour. His perspective is somewhat different focusing not on the elderly but on younger people raised in the era of social media:

Loneliness and isolation are often associated with their effects on mental and emotional health. But Nobel says it's also important to understand the impact on physical health that can come from experiencing those feelings. ""What's only recently come to light is that loneliness won't just make you miserable it'll kill you. And not just from suicide or drug overdose but from heart disease cancer or other kinds of physical ailments"" Nobel said. ""It turns out that loneliness increases risk of early death by 30 percent — as much as smoking 15 cigarettes a day."" Though loneliness is experienced widely across Americans it disproportionately affects younger people people of color and low-income individuals according to the Cigna study. The study found that 79 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 report feeling lonely in comparison with 41 percent of seniors aged 66 and older. Nobel says that social media is a big factor in why younger generations experience loneliness at higher rates.

How can we alleviate America's crisis of loneliness and social atomization? On many levels and in a myriad of different ways we need to nurture the public sphere and what we used to call the ""commons."" This demands a wide-ranging combination of government nonprofit and private initiatives that recognize the importance of such spaces and the types of interactions relationships and social capital that they generated there as crucial to the health and future of democracy.

America's greatly weakened social safety net must be protected and expanded. But even more important than that we must recognize that America's political and media classes have created and reinforced a false divide between emotional and mental health and questions of politics power democracy freedom and justice. Americans know and feel in their bodies and minds that something is wrong in their society but largely lack the language or conceptual framework to understand the true nature of the problem.

In the PBS interview cited above Dr. Nobel offered a concrete suggestion: ""Often the path to connect with others starts with connecting to yourself. To give yourself the room to be authentically curious about what matters to you in the world what you're interested in. And as you move towards that and explore that it often opens up channels to connect with other people who have similar curiosities and similar interests.""

Unfortunately some of the loudest and most influential voices in American society including the inescapable Donald Trump and many other Republicans (although not them alone) are offering Americans only toxic and self-destructive answers for their deeply-felt anxiety and pain. More respectable and moral leaders by and large have not addressed this crisis openly and directly. America's collective emotional and mental health crisis is not a phenomenon that can be separated from our political crisis. They are profoundly connected and there is no way to repair or redeem our democracy without addressing them together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaHJtYXNpYS5jb20vcGF0cmljay1ncmFoYW0tYXBwb2ludGVkLWFzLWNlby1vZi1tYW51bGlmZS1ob25nLWtvbmctYW5kLW1hY2F1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patrick Graham appointed as CEO of Manulife Hong Kong and Macau | HRM Asia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='hrmasia.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /patrick-graham-appointed-as-ceo-of-manulife-hong-kong-and-macau/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5359F60>, 'Connection to hrmasia.com timed out.

It’s still open.

Here are five things to know about the matter:

Who took the Clermont Senior Services money?

Greg Carson the chief financial officer for the nonprofit serving older adults was hailed as an ethical public servant and family man when he died suddenly in January at the age of 48.

But authorities said they soon discovered that Carson had been embezzling money for a dozen years before he died of atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

What did Greg Carson use the money for?

Carson bought everything from high-end sunglasses to yard equipment according to Clermont Senior Services and a forensic accountant working on behalf of the agency.

The accountant said Carson made suspicious purchases with money transfers from the organization's general operating account and credit cards and credit cards believed to belong to Williamsburg Township.

He said Carson made unauthorized purchases of personal property through Amazon and Sam’s Club falsely identifying them on Clermont Senior Services’ general ledger as legitimate expenses.

For example ATV tires were described as technology supplies home theater components as equipment-maintenance expenses and a bike rack as office supplies.

The forensic accountant said a preliminary investigation determined the amount of money Carson is confirmed to have embezzled is likely just a portion of his money grab at Clermont Senior Services.

County prosecutor says further investigation unnecessary

Clermont Senior Services paused its probe saying said it needed financial help to continue it.

Instead the Clermont County prosecutor’s office and the state attorney general’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation told Clermont Senior Services in late May that further investigation was unnecessary.

“After considering the absence of information indicating anyone other than Greg Carson was involved in these allegations and since there were no living suspects further criminal investigation (is) not warranted” Prosecutor Mark Tekulve said.

New investigation launched

Another division of the attorney general’s office the Charitable Law Section subsequently told a lawyer for Clermont Senior Services that it intended to pursue a criminal investigation of the loss of funds which are supposed to be spent on things such as adult day care housing home repairs transportation and Meals on Wheels.

“While the situation remains an open investigation our legal team has recommended that we not make comment at this time” Bill DeHass CEO of Clermont Senior Services said in December.

The state attorney general’s office does not confirm the existence of or potential for investigations agency spokesman Steve Irwin has said.

Changes at Clermont Senior Services

Representatives said Clermont Senior Services replaced the embezzled public funds with management fees it can spend as it chooses pending submission of an insurance claim.

Officials say the agency has tightened control of its finances although they refused to reveal the new safeguards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVjLmVkdS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDEvcGhpbC1jb2xsaW5zLWVsZWN0ZWQtY2hhaXItb2YtdWNzLWJvYXJkLW9mLXRydXN0ZWVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phil Collins elected chair of UC's Board of Trustees,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.uc.edu', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/articles/2023/01/phil-collins-elected-chair-of-ucs-board-of-trustees.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5343160>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVjLmVkdS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDEvcGhpbC1jb2xsaW5zLWVsZWN0ZWQtY2hhaXItb2YtdWNzLWJvYXJkLW9mLXRydXN0ZWVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9kaW5zbW9yZS1qb3NodWEtbG9yZW50ei1tYW5hZ2luZy1wYXJ0bmVyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dinsmore & Shohl names Joshua Lorentz as managing partner - Cincinnati Business Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2023/01/03/dinsmore-joshua-lorentz-managing-partner.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9kaW5zbW9yZS1qb3NodWEtbG9yZW50ei1tYW5hZ2luZy1wYXJ0bmVyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcmFmdGJyZXdpbmdidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvcGhvdG8tcG9zdC1jaW5jaW5uYXRpcy1maWZ0eS13ZXN0LWJyZXdpbmctcmVvcGVucy1icmV3cHViLWxldHMtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtcmVub3ZhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photo post!

Aleem Maqbool

Editor bidang agama BBC News

2 Januari 2023

Mary Elizabeth telah menjalani kehidupan yang saleh sederhana dan sunyi sebagai suster Ordo Karmel dalam agama Katolik. Selama bertahun-tahun dia menghabiskan hari-harinya dalam sebuah sel ordo tersebut di Inggris Utara.

Tetapi sebuah pertemuan singkat dengan seorang biarawan berujung pada sebuah pesan: ""Apakah kamu rela meninggalkan ordomu dan menikah dengan saya?""

Kisah ini bermula ketika Suster Mary Elizabeth menyentuh lengan baju seorang biarawan di ruang tamu biara di Preston Lancashire. Kejadian tersebut mengubah hidup Suster Mary yang telah menjadi biarawati selama 24 tahun.

Awalnya kepala biara Ordo Karmel di Preston meminta Elizabeth bertemu dengan bruder Robert yang sedang berkunjung dari biara Karmel di Oxford untuk menawarkan makanan kepadanya.

Namun kepala biara pergi sebentar untuk menjawab panggilan telepon. Sehingga dia meninggalkan mereka berdua saja.

""Itu pertama kali kami berada di satu ruangan. Kami duduk di meja dan dia makan. Ketika kepala biarawati tidak kembali saya mempersilakannya keluar ruangan.""

Saat Suster Mary Elizabeth membukakan pintu bagi Robert secara tak sengaja dia menyentuh lengan baju sang bruder dan dia merasakan sebuah setruman.

""Saya merasakan koneksi emosional saat itu sesuatu dan saya malu akan perasaan tersebut. Dan saya pikir aduh apakah dia merasakan itu juga. Dan ketika saya mengiringinya keluar ruangan saya agak canggung.""

Sekitar seminggu kemudian ia menerima pesan Robert yang bertanya apakah dia mau meninggalkan ordo untuk menikah dengannya.

""Saya sedikit kaget. Saya mengenakan kerudung sehingga ia tidak pernah melihat warna rambut saya. Ia tidak mengetahui apapun tentang saya sebenarnya ia tidak tahu mengenai masa lalu saya. Bahkan ia tidak tahu nama asli saya"" ungkap dia.

Sebelum memasuki Ordo Karmel pada usia 19 tahun Suster Mary Elizabeth dikenal dengan nama Lisa Tinkler yang berasal dari Middlesbrough.

Meski orangtuanya tidak beragama ziarah tantenya ke Lourdes membangkitkan sesuatu di dalam Lisa yang berumur enam tahun. Bahkan ia meminta kepada ayahnya untuk mendirikan altar di kamarnya.

""Saya memiliki patung kecil Bunda Maria di atasnya dan botol kecil berisi air dari Lourdes. Sebenarnya saya pikir yang suci adalah botolnya bukan airnya - sehingga saya terus mengisinya dari keran dan minum air itu"" kata Lisa.

Lisa kemudian menemukan salah satu gereja Katolik Roma di kotanya dan ia duduk sendirian di barisan kedua.

Di situlah ia menumbuhkan rasa cinta mendalam kepada Bunda Maria ibunda Yesus serta perasaan bahwa dia punya panggilan.

Sebuah retret yang digelar di biara saat ia masih remaja membuat dia semakin yakin akan panggilan itu. Biara itu diurus oleh para suster Karmel dari ordo yang didirikan sejak abad ke-12.

Kehidupan di situ cukup sederhana terpencil dan ketat - tetapi dia memutuskan bahwa itulah kehidupan yang ingin dia jalani.

Keterangan gambar Robert tumbuh besar di Polandia namun menjadi biarawan Ordo Karmel di Oxford.

Walaupun Lisa ingin langsung bergabung ibunya - yang sebenarnya kurang setuju dengan keputusan anaknya - diam-diam menulis surat kepada kesusteran untuk meminta kepergian Lisa ditunda beberapa bulan. Supaya Lisa dapat menghabiskan satu Natal terakhir di rumah.

Ia bergabung pada tahun baru.

""Sejak saat itu saya hidup bagaikan pertapa. Kami mendapatkan waktu rekreasi dua kali sehari selama setengah jam. Saat itu kami boleh berbicara tapi di luar waktu tersebut kami berdiam diri di bilik masing-masing. Kami tidak bekerja dengan siapapun selalu sendirian"" kata Lisa Tinkler—nama Suster Mary Elizabeth sebelum menjadi biarawati.

Beberapa tahun berlalu Suster Mary Elizabeth mulai merasa perbendaharaan katanya berkurang karena dia tidak punya banyak hal untuk dibicarakan bersama biarawati lain yang umurnya jauh di atas dia.

Ia hanya bisa membicarakan cuaca dan keindahan alam di kebun. Ia hanya bertemu dengan ibunya empat kali lewat jeruji.

""Saat saya berulang tahun yang ke-21 kue saya dan kartu-kartu ucapan dikirim lewat laci. Dan ketika keponakan saya lahir ia dibawa lewat meja putar"" katanya sambil tertawa mengingat kembali momen itu.

Dia menjabarkan bagaimana ia merasa 'dunia internal' terbuka namun dunia luar mulai tertutup baginya. Ada perasaan tenang dan puas.

Keterangan gambar Lisa smengatakan sebelum bertemu Robert ia tidak tahu seperti apa rasanya jatuh cinta.

Akan tetapi pada hari itu di ruang tamu biara segalanya berubah dengan sentuhan lengan dan pesan yang memintanya untuk meninggalkan kehidupan biarawati untuk menikah.

Suster Mary Elizabeth tidak memberikan Robert jawaban dan tidak tahu harus berbuat apa.

Meski Robert tidak tahu apa-apa tentang dirinya Suster Mary Elizabeth tahu sedikit tentang dia.

Saat bruder Robert berkunjung dari Oxford ke pusat retret Karmel di Preston Robert kerap kali memimpin misa di biara terdekat. Suster Mary Elizabeth menyimak khotbahnya dari balik jeruji.

Dengan mendengar anekdot yang bruder Robert bawakan Suster Mary Elizabeth mendapatkan sedikit pengetahuan tentang kehidupannya. Bruder Robert dibesarkan di Silesia Polandia dekat perbatasan Jerman dan begitu cinta pada pegunungan.

Meski begitu Suster Mary Elizabeth mengakui khotbah sang biarawan tidak memiliki pengaruh besar padanya.

Kini tiba-tiba semua berubah.

""Saya tidak tahu bagaimana perasaannya jatuh cinta dan saya pikir suster-suster lain bisa melihatnya di wajah saya. Saya menjadi gugup. Saya merasa ada yang berubah dalam diri saya dan itu menakutkan bagi saya"" katanya.

Suster Mary Elizabeth akhirnya memberanikan diri untuk bercerita kepada kepala biaranya mengenai perasaan yang ia miliki untuk Bruder Robert tetapi ia hanya mendapat tanggapan tidak percaya.

""Dia tidak mengerti bagaimana itu bisa terjadi sebab kami berada di bawah pengawasannya sepanjang waktu. Sang kepala biara bingung bagaimana kami bisa jatuh cinta dengan kontak yang sangat singkat itu"" kata Lisa.

Suster Mary Elizabeth sudah membayangkan reaksi keluarganya atau uskupnya jika ia meninggalkan biara. Ia juga bergumul dengan perasaan apakah hubungannya dengan Tuhan akan berubah.

Tetapi percakapannya dengan kepala biara membuat dia melakukan sesuatu yang mengejutkan.

""Kepala biara cukup galak terhadap saya jadi saya mengenakan celana dan memasukakn sikat gigi ke dalam tas dan keluar dan saya tidak permah kembali sebagai Suster Mary Elizabeth"" ujar Lisa Tinkler kepada saya.

Bruder Robert mengirim pesan kepada Lisa yang mengatakan ia berencana berkunjung ke Preston lagi di sore hari. Kali ini untuk bertemu teman Karmel untuk meminta saran di bar terdekat.

Temannya merupakan orang pertama yang ia percayai untuk tahu tentang situasi dia dan Lisa.

Lisa menebak mereka akan bertemu di restoran Black Bull sekitar satu mil di jalan jadi ia memutuskan untuk pergi ke sana.

Namun bukannya menjadi momen yang menyenangkan Lisa malah terlempar ke dalam kekacauan yang mendalam pada malam November 2015 itu.

Keterangan gambar Robert mengaku ketakutan saat melihat Lisa di restoran.

""Hujan deras turun saat saya menelusuri jalan Garstang. Mobil-mobil datang ke arah saya dengan lampu depan yang terang dan saya hanya berpikir 'Saya bisa mengakhiri ini'"" katanya merujuk pada keinginannya untuk bunuh diri sesaat.

""Saya benar-benar berjuang saya pikir saya harus mencegah ini terjadi agar Robert dapat melanjutkan hidupnya. Tetapi saya juga bertanya-tanya apakah dia benar-benar yakin dengan apa yang dia katakan tentang [ingin] menikah.""

Tapi Lisa terus berjalan sampai dia tengah malam dalam kondisi basah kuyup tanpa mantel dalam pakaian susternya di luar restoran Black Bull. Dia baru memberanikan diri untuk masuk ke dalam ketika dia melihat sang bruder duduk di dalam melalui pintu yang terbuka.

""Ketika saya melihatnya jantung saya berhenti"" kata Robert.

Tetapi sebenarnya saya lumpuh karena rasa takut bukan kebahagiaan karena saya tahu pada momen itu bahwa saya harus sepenuhya memberikan diri untuk Lisa tetapi saya juga tahu kami belum siap untuk itu"" kata dia.

Robert sudah menjadi biarawan Karmel selama 13 tahun sampai titik itu. Ia seorang pemikir akademisi dan teolog yang masuk ke dalam kehidupan biara untuk mencari makna dalam apa yang ia gambarkan sebagai krisis iman dan identitas.

Ketika sekarang dia menengok ke masa lalunya ia merasa cara dia dibesarkan membuat kebingungan itu tidak bisa dihindari. Ia dibesarkan di wilayah yang baru beralih dari Jerman ke Polandia dengan ayah yang beragama Kristen Lutheran dan ibu yang memeluk agama Katolik.

Tetapi periode itu cukup gelap baginya setelah hubungan yang gagal membuat Robert terus mencari rasa pemenuhan di Inggris - terlepas dari teologi Protestan Lutheran yang telah ia anut - di biara Katolik Roma Ordo Karmel di mana dia menemukan pelipur lara.

""Sebelumnya saya tidak tahu banyak tentang Karmel dan tidak pernah memikirkan ingin menjadi biara. Padahal saya selalu curiga akan bentuk ekspresi kepercayaan apapun"" kata Robert.

Tetapi ia mengatakan ordonya mengajarkannya untuk menerima kegelapan kesulitan dan krisis itu hingga ia merasa tenang. Namun pertemuannya dengan Lisa yang saat itu ia hanya kenal sebatas namanya Suster Mary Elizabeth yang memutarbalikkan hidupnya.

Keterangan gambar Robert memulai hidup baru pada usia 53 tahun.

""Sentuhannya pada lengan baju saya memulai suatu perubahan. Meski saya merasa ada sesuatu yang perlahan tumbuh dalam hati saya tidak pernah merasa jatuh cinta secara tak waras karena dengan menjadi biara atau suster kami diajarkan cara mengatasi emosi itu"" kata Robert.

Ia menjelaskan pesannya kepada Lisa yang memintanya untuk menikah merupakan pergulatan intelektual dengan dirinya.

""Saat dia hadir di bar setan kecil dalam diri saya ketakutan. Tetapi rasa takut bukanlah terkait iman atau kepercayaan saya melainkan mengenai bagaimana saya akan memulai hidup baru pada usia 53 tahun"" kata dia.

Perubahan itu sulit terutama pada awal-awal. Lisa mengingat sebuah momen menjelang Natal setelah mereka meninggalkan kehidupan biara.

""Saya melihat Robert dan dia terlihat tertekan dan menangis. Pada saat itu kami berdua telah mencapai titik terpuruk dan merasa seperti kami seharusnya meminum sesuatu seperti Romeo dan Juliet untuk mengakhiri semua ini"" kata Lisa.

""Sulit sekali karena kami berdua merasa sangat sendirian dan terisolasi dan kami tidak tahu harus melakukan apa untuk melangkah maju. Tetapi kami berpegangan tangan dan melewati semua itu"" kata Lisa.

Mereka menceritakan momen di pusat penyaluran tenaga kerja saat mereka mencucurkan air mata ketika ditanya mengenai keahlian mereka - dan saat mereka mengendarai mobil dari Preston ke Yorkshire.

""Saya membeli buku dalam bahasa Polandia tentang para biarawati yang meninggalkan ordo mereka dengan berbagai alasan. Saya membaca dan menerjemahkannya bagi Lisa dalam mobil. Tetapi ia harus menepi di jalur M62.""

""Kami berdua sampai menangis karena kisah-kisah itu sangat emosional dan kami bisa terhubung dengan mereka"" kata Robert.

Keterangan gambar Lisa menjadi pendeta di rumah sakit sedangkan Robert menjadi pendeta Gereja Anglikan.

Hal yang membawa mereka damai menjadi hal yang mengarahkan mereka ke biara di awal - terhubung dengan keyakinan personal.

""Sepanjang hidup religius mereka mengatakan hati kami seharusnya tak terbagi dan diberikan sepenuhnya kepada Tuhan. Tiba-tiba saya merasa hati saya tumbuh lebih besar untuk merangkul Robert tetapi saya sadar bahwa hatiku masih mampu menampung segala hal di dalamnya. Saya tidak memiliki perasaan berbeda tentang Tuhan dan itu meyakinkan saya"" kata Lisa.

Lisa pertama bekerja di rumah duka dan kemudian sebagai pendeta rumah sakit.

Meski ia sempat sedih setelah menerima surat dari Roma yang mengatakan dirinya sudah tidak lagi menjadi anggota Ordo Karmel Robert kemudian diterima oleh Gereja Inggris.

Mereka menikah dan kini tinggal bersama di kampung Hutton Rudby di Yorkshire Utara. Di sana pula Robert ditahbiskan sebagai pendeta di gereja setempat. Mereka masih dalam proses beradaptasi dengan kehidupan di luar biara.

Terutama Lisa yang sudah terisolasi selama 24 tahun dan tidak memiliki kehidupan akademik seperti Robert mengaku merasa seperti pengamat dunia luar. Baru sekarang dia mencoba-coba gaya rambut dan gaya berpakaian apa yang cocok untuknya setelah ia tidak lagi wajib mengenakan baju suster.

Mereka berdua masih merindukan beberapa aspek kehidupan ordo. Lisa bahkan mengatakan jika tidak ada Robert ia akan kembali menjadi biarawati Karmel besok.

Kami sudah terbiasa dengan kesunyian dan kesendirian dua hal yang sulit ditemukan dalam urusan duniawi. Anda ditarik ke segala arah sehingga terus menjadi tantangan bagi saya dan Robert untuk terpusat dan tenang"" kata Lisa.

Tetapi mereka menemukan solusi yang ampuh.

""Saya sering merasa seperti saya hidup di biara bersama Robert seperti dua orang dari Ordo Karmel yang melakukan segala hal untuk Tuhan. Kami memusatkan diri kita pada doa tetapi cinta bisa membuat sakramen untuk semua yang kami lakukan dan saya menyadari tidak ada yang benar-benar berubah bagi saya"" katanya.

Lisa mengatakan mereka berdua setuju bahwa ada tiga orang dalam pernikahan mereka.

""Tuhan ada di tengah pernikahan ini dan didahulukan di atas segalanya. Kalau kami menghilangkannya saya pikir kami tidak akan bertahan lama.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbnRpa2EuY29tL3JlYWQvMTY3NDc0OC9hbGFzYW4taWxtaWFoLWthbXUtamF0dWgtY2ludGEtZGVuZ2FuLXByaWEteWFuZy1zaWZhdG55YS1iZXJiZWRh0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FudGlrYS5jb20vYW1wLzE2NzQ3NDgvYWxhc2FuLWlsbWlhaC1rYW11LWphdHVoLWNpbnRhLWRlbmdhbi1wcmlhLXlhbmctc2lmYXRueWEtYmVyYmVkYQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alasan Ilmiah Kamu Jatuh Cinta dengan Pria yang Sifatnya Berbeda,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3BzLmlkL2hvdC9wci0yOTQ2NDEzNDcyL2VybmEtYW5hay1hc3VoLXlhbmctYXlhaG55YS1kaXBhc3VuZy1iaWtpbi1jaW50YS1sYXVyYS1tYXJhaC1wYWRhLWRpcmktc2VuZGlyaS1raXRhLWtvbXBsYWluLW5nZ2FrLXBlbnRpbmfSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9wcy5pZC9ob3QvYW1wL3ByLTI5NDY0MTM0NzIvZXJuYS1hbmFrLWFzdWgteWFuZy1heWFobnlhLWRpcGFzdW5nLWJpa2luLWNpbnRhLWxhdXJhLW1hcmFoLXBhZGEtZGlyaS1zZW5kaXJpLWtpdGEta29tcGxhaW4tbmdnYWstcGVudGluZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erna anak asuh yang ayahnya dipasung bikin Cinta Laura marah pada diri sendiri: Kita komplain nggak penting! - Hops ID,"Hops.ID – Tak hanya memiliki kecantikan fisik Cinta Laura ternyata juga memiliki kecantikan hati terutama terkait dengan pendidikan anak.

Last year 153160 tech workers lost their jobs according to Layoffs.fyi which tracks corporate layoffs and dismissals.

That’s more than 50% of all tech job losses since the start of the pandemic. And it’s 10 times as many as 2021 according to data on the site.

It’s a brutal tally that brings the early days of the pandemic to mind. Between March and December 2020 over 70000 tech workers lost their jobs. But it still falls well short of the dotcom bubble. Two million people were laid off in 2001 according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal.

Amazon and Meta were the two biggest tech companies to swing the ax last year laying off a combined 21000 people. While Elon Musk’s decimation of the staff at Twitter arguably earned the most widespread attention it was just the fifth-largest tech layoff of the year. Booking.com (which let 4375 people go) and Cisco (which terminated 4100) both topped the social media site’s cuts.

All totaled 1172 tech companies reduced their headcount last year according to Layoffs.fyi.

The data gathered by the company which is not exact and based on both media reports and company announcements shows how quickly things went sour for tech companies. In the first quarter of 2022 fewer than 10000 tech workers were laid off. In May however the total nearly doubled—and continued to grow by leaps and bounds for the rest of the year.

The upside for tech workers is a significant percentage managed to find new jobs quickly. The Wall Street Journal cites a report from ZipRecruiter that found 79% of laid-off tech workers found a new job within three months of losing their old one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3Vyc3BvcnRzZWRnZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wMi9rZW50dWNreS1zaWduZWUtdHktYnJ5YW50cy1mYXRoZXItc3RpbGwtaGFzLXZvaWNlLW1haWwtbWVzc2FnZS1oaXMtc29uLXJlY29yZGVkLWF0LWFnZS00L3ZhdWdodHMtdmlld3MvbGFycnl2YXVnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kentucky signee Ty Bryant's father still has voice mail message his son recorded at age 4,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3Vyc3BvcnRzZWRnZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wMi9rZW50dWNreS1zaWduZWUtdHktYnJ5YW50cy1mYXRoZXItc3RpbGwtaGFzLXZvaWNlLW1haWwtbWVzc2FnZS1oaXMtc29uLXJlY29yZGVkLWF0LWFnZS00L3ZhdWdodHMtdmlld3MvbGFycnl2YXVnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2FA7040>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Conger stands by Jackson Plaza plans

The second reading of the budget for the $4 million purchase and sale agreement to acquire the Jackson Plaza property was approved 7-1 with District 9 council member David Cisco holding the singular opposing vote.

Prior to the vote District 3 council member Richard Donnell inquired about how the $4 million purchase price was decided to which Mayor Scott Conger clarified its derivation came as a result from “negotiation and tax appraisal on the property.”

Mayor Conger lends details about 'Jackson Plaza' reboot - convention center planned

$4 million purchase of Jackson Plaza property to rejuvenate city development

The next steps following the approval of the acquisition necessitate the completion and inherent clearance of both environmental and feasibility studies. Though a convention center and accompanying arena are still anticipated to occupy the space the studies may reflect a better use of the property’s redevelopment.

“We should close on the property in the next 55 days” Conger said. “That will get us to hopefully next month present with the council our sub-area master plan.”

The master plan will include logistical decisions concerning not only the most beneficial uses for the land but will additionally evaluate how other businesses will be affected. Conger added that the city wants to be a “good partner” to the existing surrounding tenants.

The city’s plan to redevelop what is formerly known as Service Merchandise came three and a half years sooner than the previously expected date of Feb. 28 2026 when the property's lease was scheduled to end.

With respect to skeptics of the community who are not entirely sold on the property’s redevelopment plans or its location the mayor encourages them to “wait and see” what the future holds for the potential of the land.

“Look at the alternative — two businesses in a 221000 square-foot facility that’s vacant that’s just adding to the deterioration of the neighborhood and the center of our city so that’s the other option we have right now” Conger said. “Or we can move forward with some progress and make some investments in the center of our city and look at redevelopment of that entire section of town.”

Interchange improvements

The city of Jackson will enter into a contract with TDOT based on an allocation of funds for the project totaling $28 million for the reconstruction of the I-40 and Christmasville interchange.

Director of the Jackson Planning Department Stan Pilant explained that construction will end south of the I-40 bridge and will be replaced with a five-lane cross-section extending to the commercial section of Kenworth Blvd.

“That’s a section that’s very congested and it needs improvement so we're happy to play a part in this project and also to see the benefit of not having to bear that project all ourselves” Pilant said. “We’re thankful for TDOT and their willingness to do this project and I think we’re getting a good bang for our buck here.”

The local contribution match of $410000 was necessary considering the widening of a local street. The contribution will be taken from Surface Transportation Funds which Conger describes as an allotment of funding that comes from the state and is distributed to the Metropolitan Planning Organization.

The city’s utilization of these allocated funds absolves the need for taxpayer dollars to be used.

The improvement to the interchange will be an approximately three-year-long process once it begins and an initial payment of $30000 will cover environmental and preliminary engineering.

The council voted 7-1 to approve the contract with one vote abstained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vZ3JpZGluc29mdC5jb20vYmxvZ3MvaGFja2Vycy11c2UtZXhjZWwtYWRkLWlucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hackers Use Excel Add-Ins as Initial Penetration Vector,"Cisco Talos analysts say that hackers are now using Excel add-ins to infiltrate victims’ systems and networks.

After Microsoft began blocking VBA macros in Office documents downloaded from the Internet (marked as Mark Of The Web) attackers had to rethink their attack chains: for example now hackers are increasingly using Excel add-in files (.XLL) as an initial compromise vector.

According to experts Office documents distributed using phishing emails and other social engineering remain one of the most popular attack vectors for attackers. Such documents traditionally suggest that victims enable macros to view supposedly harmless content but in fact activate hidden malware execution in the background.

To address these abuses earlier this year Microsoft began blocking VBA macros in Office documents downloaded from the Internet. Although the company admitted that they received negative feedback from users because of this and were even forced to temporarily reverse this decision as a result the blocking of VBA macros was still continued.

We also wrote that Hackers use the .NET library for creating malicious Excel files and also that Weak Block Cipher in Microsoft Office 365 Leads to Message Content Disclosure.

Despite the fact that the blocking only applies to the latest versions of Access Excel PowerPoint Visio and Word attackers have begun experimenting with alternative ways to infect and deploy malware. One such “innovation” is the use of XLL files which Microsoft describes as “a kind of DLL file that can only be opened in Excel” the researchers report.

XLL files can be sent via email and even with normal malware scanning mechanisms in place users can open them without knowing that such files may contain malicious code. writes Cisco Talos.

Although Excel warns about the potential dangers of XLLs these warnings are usually overlooked by users.

According to experts hackers combine add-ons written in C++ with add-ons developed using the free tool Excel-DNA. And if the first such experiments of hackers were noticed a few years ago then in 2021-2022 such attacks began to develop much more actively.

The researchers write that the Chinese hack groups APT10 and TA410 (and they started back in 2017) the Russian-speaking group FIN7 which began using add-on files in their campaigns last summer famous Dridex malware loader and FormBook loader; as well as other major malware families including AgentTesla Ransomware Stop Vidar Buer Loader Nanocore IceID Arkei AsyncRat BazarLoader and so on are already abusing XLL."

(Reuters) -Kentucky on Tuesday warned 11 major financial companies including Citigroup Inc JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc of potential divestment over their ""boycott"" of energy companies.

State government entities must notify the Treasurer of direct or indirect holdings in the companies in the list. They must also write to the firms asking them to stop the ""boycott"" failing which they could be subject to divestment Kentucky State Treasurer Allison Ball said.

Republicans have been ramping up pressure on the finance industry over what they say are their increasingly aggressive environmental social and governance (ESG) practices.

In the past year other states like West Virginia and Texas have also boycotted several financial firms.

A JPMorgan spokesperson said ""we believe our business practices are in line with Kentucky law and we are hopeful a deeper look at these facts would lead to reconsideration"" adding that the bank was among the largest financiers of the U.S. traditional and renewable energy industries including in Kentucky.

The bank finances energy companies that include American Electric Power and Duke Energy Corp in the state a source familiar with the matter said.

Citigroup declined to comment while BlackRock pointed to a recent testimony in Texas by Dalia Blass its head of external affairs group.

In the testimony Blass said BlackRock is a significant investor in many energy companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp.

It's a great start to the new year 2023 for Monster Energy Honda Team as rider Ricky Brabec bagged a win and lead. Special stage number one at the Dakar Rally 2023 brought 369 km of action throughout sandy and stony tracks with start point and arrival at the Sea Camp bivouac – close to Yanbu (South Arabia). American Ricky Brabec was the stage winner on a day where all team riders were in the spotlight.With this result Brabec – the 2020 Dakar winner – gets into first position in the overall standings. Pablo Quintanilla (Chile) was seventh Adrien Van Beveren (France) was ranked ninth and José Ignacio Cornejo – who had the hard mission to open the stage – finished in 10th place in this first stage.The second stage from this year’s Dakar Rally will leave the Sea Camp in the direction of Al-Ula. This special stage will have 430 kilometers of closed tracks demanding great handling skills so riders will get mainly dirt tracks (59%) stones (26%) and just a little taste of sand (14% sand tracks and one percent of dunes).Besides this competitive section there is also another 159 km of liaison. Navigation will be key as participants reach the splendid canyons and beautiful landscapes near the finish. According to the ASO organisation the stage will be decided on the dunes with some of the majestic Nabataean temples visible on the landscape.Ricky Brabec: ""Goal number one was not to open the stage. I feel quite well and confident after today but I will just try to go day by day keep pace and stay in the Top 10. It’s going to be hard to be out of the lead - like we saw today - but we have to see how it goes until the rest day. Today was fairly simple no stress it was a great day!""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy90dXYtc3VkLWFuZC12ZW50dXMtZ3JvdXAtcGFydG5lci10by1wcm92aWRlLXNvbHV0aW9ucy10by13aW5kLWVuZXJneS1wbGF5ZXJzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NzEyMDk5LmNtc9IBmQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy90dXYtc3VkLWFuZC12ZW50dXMtZ3JvdXAtcGFydG5lci10by1wcm92aWRlLXNvbHV0aW9ucy10by13aW5kLWVuZXJneS1wbGF5ZXJzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjcxMjA5OS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TUV SUD and Ventus Group partner to provide solutions to wind energy players,"

German testing inspection and certification services provider TÜV SÜD has partnered with wind energy company Ventus Group to provide services to wind energy companies in India . As a part of the agreement the companies will provide solutions for measuring analysing and optimising wind farms and wind turbine performance to energy companies in India.TÜV SÜD has a client base of over 10000 companies in India and has worked on 500 plus renewable projects in India predominantly in the solar and wind sector. Ventus Group on the other hand has global expertise in the field of rotor monitoring and providing technical support.""The partnership will provide high-quality and state of art engineering solutions for measuring analyzing and optimizing wind turbine(s) or wind farm(s) performance focusing on improving the rotor efficiency of wind turbines which in turn will assist wind farm owners in maximizing production operate within Type approvals and extend the nominal life"" the companies said in an emailed response.India has had significant wind assets in operation for years and performance optimization is crucial to make these projects sustainable and viable. There is a huge market need for advanced technology solutions/services to optimize the wind farm performance in current market segmentation.A recent report by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) predicts that India is expected to install nearly 20.2 GW of wind power capacity by 2025 a growth of nearly 50% in under four years. From less than 10% of the country’s energy mix currently wind is set to contribute over 30% by the end of the decade.""Along with new installations the often-ignored fact is the growing age of existing wind assets. Several factors can influence the relationship between age and observed output in a ﬂeet of wind farms"" the companies said adding that the potential for service offerings in this market is huge.The companies provide key services to wind energy customers that help to enhance performance like Dynamic Blade Pitch Measurement (DBPM) where images are captured while wind turbines operate - dynamic and static conditions to detect relative blade pitch for the onshore and offshore wind farms. The images are processed directly on-site using proprietary image analysis software and results are shared with the customer with recommendations. On implementation of these recommendations customers can typically enhance annual energy production by 2-5% on affected wind turbines. Other associated services to be offered are accurate wind measurement through Nacelle-based LiDAR measurements; critical component condition monitoring and failure analysis/root cause analysis among others.""At TÜV SÜD renewable energy is one of the key service portfolios in India and the aim is to offer best in class services with local expertise. The synergy of this partnership is to offer advanced global technology solutions with a keen understanding of the local market. This will give the asset owner’s access to advanced solutions in operation & maintenance and in-service inspection locally which will be cost effective and timebound"" said Bratin Roy VP Industry Services  TÜV SÜD ASMEA region.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlLXN0eWxlL2hvbWUtZ2FyZGVuL3dlYi1zdG9yaWVzLzktdGhpbmdzLXlvdS1zaG91bGQtbmV2ZXItZG8taW4tYS1raXRjaGVuLXRvLWF2b2lkLW5lZ2F0aXZpdHkvcGhvdG9zdG9yeS85NjY4MjQ1Ny5jbXPSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9ob21lLWdhcmRlbi93ZWItc3Rvcmllcy85LXRoaW5ncy15b3Utc2hvdWxkLW5ldmVyLWRvLWluLWEta2l0Y2hlbi10by1hdm9pZC1uZWdhdGl2aXR5L3Bob3Rvc3RvcnkvOTY2ODI0NTcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 things you should never do in a kitchen to avoid negativity,"Breaking an egg

The Coca-Cola PFAS consumer fraud lawsuit is but the latest in a growing line of PFAS lawsuits that allege that certain consumer goods contain PFAS that the products or company’s values were marketed as healthy or environmentally friendly and that consumers would not have purchased the products if they knew that the products contained PFAS.

As we predicted in early 2021 the increased attention on PFAS content in consumer goods in the scientific community and media presented significant risks to various industries and our prediction was that the developments would lead to a significant number of lawsuits alleging consumer fraud. Consumer goods industries insurers and investment companies interested in the consumer goods vertical with niche interest in cosmetics companies must pay careful attention to these lawsuits.

Coca-Cola PFAS Consumer Fraud Lawsuit

On December 28 2022 plaintiff Joseph Lurenz filed a lawsuit in New York seeking a proposed class action against Coca-Cola. The lawsuit alleges that Coca-Cola markets the company and its Simply Tropical products as “all natural” and made with “all natural ingredients” in an effort to attract health-conscious consumers to the products. Further the lawsuit cites the ingredients list for the juice product which indicates the use of “pure filtered water.” The lawsuit alleges that this statement implies to consumers that extra care was taken by the company to remove or avoid the use of chemicals such as PFAS. However with testing showing the presence of PFAS in the juice drink the statements were false misleading or induced consumers to purchase products when the presence of PFAS in the products was not disclosed.

In the Complaint plaintiffs allege the following counts against Coca-Cola:

Violation of state consumer protection laws and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act

Breach of warranty

Fraud

Constructive fraud

Unjust enrichment

The plaintiffs seek certification of a nationwide class action lawsuit with subclasses defined as consumers in New York. In addition the lawsuit seeks damages fees costs and a jury trial.

Just the Beginning For Consumer Products Companies

With studies underway legislation pending that targets consumer goods and increasing media reporting on PFAS in consumer goods and concerns over human health product manufacturers should be increasingly wary of lawsuits similar to the Coca-Cola lawsuit being filed against them. There are an increasing number of PFAS consumer fraud cases being filed with some of the below as representative of recent trends:

Cosmetics industry: Brown v. Cover Girl New York (April 1 2022) Anderson v. Almay New York (April 1 2022) Rebecca Vega v. L’Oreal New Jersey (April 8 2022) Spindel v. Burt’s Bees California (March 25 2022) Hicks and Vargas v. L’Oreal New York (March 9 2022) Davenport v. L’Oreal California (February 22 2022)

Food packaging industry: Richburg v. Conagra Brands Illinois (May 6 2022) Ruiz v. Conagra Brands Illinois (May 6 2022) Hamman v. Cava Group California (April 27 2022) Azman Hussain v. Burger King California (April 11 2022) Little v. NatureStar California (April 8 2022) Larry Clark v. McDonald’s Illinois (March 28 2022)

Feminine hygiene products: Gemma Rivera v. Knix Wear Inc. California (April 4 2022) Blenis v. Thinx Inc. Massachusetts (June 18 2021) Destini Canan v. Thinx Inc. California (November 12 2020)



As the above is indicative of several major companies now find themselves embroiled in litigation focused on PFAS false advertising consumer protection violations and deceptive statements made in marketing and ESG reports. The lawsuits may well serve as test cases for plaintiffs’ bar to determine whether similar lawsuits will be successful in any (or all) of the fifty states in this country. Companies must consider the possibility of needing to defend lawsuits involving plaintiffs in all fifty states for products that contain PFAS.

It should be noted that these lawsuits would only touch on the marketing advertising ESG reporting and consumer protection type of issues. Separate products lawsuits could follow that take direct aim at obtaining damages for personal injury for plaintiffs from consumer products. In addition environmental pollution lawsuits could seek damage for diminution of property value cleanup costs and PFAS filtration systems if drinking water cleanup is required.

Conclusion

It is of the utmost importance that businesses along the whole supply chain in the consumer products industry evaluate their PFAS risk. Public health and environmental groups urge legislators to regulate PFAS at an ever-increasing pace. Similarly state level EPA enforcement action is increasing at a several-fold rate every year. Now the first wave of lawsuits take direct aim at the consumer products industry. Companies that did not manufacture PFAS but merely utilized PFAS in their manufacturing processes are therefore becoming targets of costly enforcement actions at rates that continue to multiply year over year. Lawsuits are also filed monthly by citizens or municipalities against companies that are increasingly not PFAS chemical manufacturers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoZXJubGl2aW5nLmNvbS9ob3ctZG91YmxlLWNvbGEtYmVjYW1lLXBhcnQtb2YtdGhlLWZhYnJpYy1vZi1jaGF0dGFub29nYS03MDkwNjAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Double Cola Became Part Of The Fabric Of Chattanooga,"Back in 1922 a man by the name of Charlie Little founded the Good Grape company which later would became the Double Cola Company. As the tale goes Charles Little was an eccentric guy who had a bathtub in his house specifically for testing new beverage concoctions. If something was deemed good by family and friends he would fine tune it and take it to a captive audience on the Chattanooga railroad. At the time Chattanooga was key in the Southern railway system and was always humming with activity.

With his beverages in hand that was the beginning of what today is known as the Double Cola Company. That grape soda later became part of their Jumbo line of fruity sodas.

The company eventually became the Seminole Flavor Company in 1924. In 1933 they introduced Double Cola named so because of it being double the size of other cola products on the market.

In 1953 Seminole Flavor Company changed its name to be the Double Cola Company and today it celebrates its centennial as a beverage company.

But changes continued to roll from the 1950s until present day. The company changed ownership a few different times and new products continue to be introduced liked Ski their number one selling product a citrus soda made with real orange and lemon and a variety of other limited-time offers.

Today you’ll find their products in the South part of the Midwest and nationally in Cracker Barrel stores.

In 1991 Alnoor Dhanani moved to Chattanooga from London when his family purchased the Double Cola Company. He became CEO in 1997 and remains in charge today.

On October 10 2022 the Double Cola Company celebrated its remarkable 100th anniversary with activities across Chattanooga where Double Cola is still headquartered. A soda brand with a niche Southern and Midwest following may have wavered in ownership over the years but it always remained a part of Chattanooga. And in fact if it wasn’t for this city the beverage company may never have started.

""We have always felt that we have been blessed to be in Chattanooga and this town has been nice to us” says Dhanani.

Giving back is a huge part of what they do and the company has involved itself in many nonprofits in the community including the United Way American Cancer Society and more. Part of their centennial celebration culminated with a Habitat for Humanity build.

Each quarter an employee picks an organization meaningful to them and the company supports them through volunteering and other contributions. In fact they have become so ingrained in the fabric of the community that the City of Chattanooga declared the week of October 9 Double Cola week.

As for the future as beverage preferences continue to change the company hopes to be a part of the changing consumer beverages. The company recently added their first alcoholic beverages BrewSki a shandy made with beer and Ski soda and they plan to look at other opportunities in this space like canned cocktails.

“We’ll be looking more to the health-related beverages different products able to provide to the new consumer that they are looking for” says Dhanani mentioning things like water-related beverages and maybe even CBD or energy drinks.

One thing that won’t change: their dedication to Chattanooga and their loyal customer base.

“There is an amazing legacy of customers where we have known grandparents and their kids and grandkids who have supported us” says Dhanani. “And of course our love for the Chattanooga community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vY29udmVyZ2VudC10di9yb2t1LXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtMy1sZWFkaW5nLWNwZy1icmFuZHMtaW4tZnVydGhlci1vcmlnaW5hbHMtcHVzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roku Partners With Leading CPG Brands in Further Originals Push,"Fresh off the heels of its biggest brand partnership and activation to date  Roku teamed up with three consumer packaged goods brands for shows from Roku Originals .

Coca-Cola Henkel and Scotts have all signed on as sponsors for three original shows: Emeril Tailgates Children Ruin Everything and Martha Gardens.

“It’s been interesting to see especially given the challenges with CPG as a category this year how much that vertical has leaned into wanting to test with Roku Originals all in their own different way” Katina Papas Wachter Roku’s head of ad revenue strategy at The Roku Channel told Adweek.

The 18-time Grand Slam singles champion said in a statement that she has been diagnosed with both throat and breast cancer. She is set to begin treatment this month and her prognosis is good.

“This double whammy is serious but still fixable and I’m hoping for a favorable outcome” she said. “It’s going to stink for a while but I’ll fight with all have I got.”

Navratilova initially noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck during the WTA Finals in Texas in November. A biopsy revealed that she has early stage throat cancer. Further testing uncovered early stage breast cancer.

She previously had been diagnosed with a noninvasive form of breast cancer in 2010 and underwent a lumpectomy.

In a tweet on Monday the International Tennis Hall of Fame member expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support in the wake of the news.

“Needless to say my phone and twitter are both blowing up” she said. “So I will say again – thank you for all your support and I am not done yet.”

Needless to say my phone and twitter are both blowing up so I will say again- thank you all for your support and I am not done yet:)

Clark scored 16 of her points in the fourth quarter shooting 5-for-6 from the floor and 4-for-5 from 3-point range. But the star junior fouled out with 19 seconds left and Iowa’s comeback attempt fell short in the 90-86 loss.

Illinois had not beaten Iowa in its last seven tries. And the Illini had not beaten a ranked opponent on their home court at State Farm Center since 2015. That changed Sunday.

“I think Illinois is such an improved basketball team and sometimes you have to see it to believe it” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said after the game. “We could see it on film but I think our players didn’t realize just how good they were until that second quarter when they just took over the game.”

Even though she fouled out late Clark played 37 minutes and she contributed five rebounds and seven assists in addition to her game-leading 32 points.

Iowa’s pair of senior forwards also contributed: Monika Czinano had 24 points and six rebounds and McKenna Warnock had 17 points and six rebounds.

Yet depth remains an issue for the Hawkeyes. Their bench scored just four points all courtesy of freshman Hannah Stuelke.

In last year’s NCAA tournament lack of depth doomed No. 2 seed Iowa in a second-round loss to to No. 10 seed Creighton. The Hawkeyes will need to solve that problem if they want to make a deeper run this March.

Next up Iowa travels to face No. 14 Michigan at 4:30 p.m. ET Saturday in another Big Ten battle."

Most recently VP of global application development Foster joined the consumer goods company in 1996. He’s held a range of leadership roles that have resulted in new systems across planning and execution processes according to a company LinkedIn post announcing the news as well as new organizational capabilities.

Foster shared the news of his new role in his own post adding “I am fortunate to have an incredible organization and leadership team as we move into the new year and I am looking forward to what we can do together in 2023 and beyond!”

Crowe a 2021 CGT CIO of the Year  has spent more than three decades with the No. 30 publicly owned consumer goods company  where he was recruited from the healthcare software industry.

He was named CIO in 2013 and led the company’s IT transformation during the pandemic including evolving their ways of working to result in significant productivity improvements.

In an interview with CGT Crowe frequently cited the company’s culture as critical keys to his accomplishments and pointed to the value of his teams’ contributions across the enterprise.

“Colgate’s culture has helped shape me into a caring leader who collaborates effectively with Colgate people all around the world and empowers my teams to continuously improve experiment and think differently” he said.

Colgate-Palmolive as a whole has spoken often about its intent to accelerate its digital transformation  with company leaders frequently referring to their improved collaboration capabilities as both indicators and drivers of future success.

Pat Verduin chief technology officer of Colgate-Palmolive also retired at the end of December with Stephen Habif filling her shoes as part of a move announced last summer . She had been with the company for 15 years and led its global technology and design organization.

In this animated video we get a glimpse into the lives of four individual Grab drivers who partnered with Colgate to help inspire others.

We get to know Benjie Estillore who at 52 years old decided to go back to his studies to finish high school even as he works as a Grab driver. We also find out the story of Gina Dayao who is no stranger to working side gigs as she drives so she could help support her family.

There’s also Chaelvert Betarmos who found new joy even after being rejected from working abroad by becoming a Grab driver and content creator at the same time. And we feel the warm embrace of Saturnino Mopas fondly known as Daddy Ninoy who created a community of more than a hundred drivers so that they can help each other achieve their dreams.

Colgate has partnered up with Grab to share these amazing individuals who are grabbing life’s challenges and turning them into opportunities. Together they inspire all of us to do our best dream big and #SmileStrong.

“You have to be really careful of the stuff that you pull up on the internet because it looks good until you get involved and find out something totally different. They took the money out my account but they never resolved the issue” said James Clark.

It all started when he tried to get in contact with Xfinity by googling the company. What he found instead was an ad at the top of the page pretending to be Xfinity but with a misspelled name.

Once Clark entered his debit card info that’s when he knew something was wrong.

“It was like call back in 30 minutes and then call back in an hour. Then they were like it’s an error on my part then it was an error on their part” Clark explained.

After weeks of trying to dispute the charges for a company identified as Billpy Services (Billpay without an A) it looks like his debit card company isn’t going to be able to do anything.

“I called them to have the payment stopped and they were like we’ll do what we can do and it’ll take 45 business days.

The new offering replaces the annual Watchathon Week which had been a popular draw for customers over the past 10 years according to the company. X1 and Flex also have previously hosted Free TV Week around Thanksgiving.

Free This Week programming will be made available on a single destination and a selection of programming will also be available on the Xfinity Stream app and Xumo’s XClass TV. As of September 30 Comcast had about 16 million residential cable customers in the U.S. virtually all of them on X1. Nearly 4 million Flex devices have been distributed to Comcast broadband customers since the service launched in 2017. (Flex technology is also being licensed to a new joint streaming venture between Comcast and Charter.)

In a nod to the New Year’s mood the first two weeks of Free This Week will feature free access to wellness apps like The Great Courses Gaia One Day University Gaiam TV Sweat Factor and FitFusion by Jillian Michaels. Future participants will include HBO Max Showtime Revolt History Vault Lifetime Movie Club and others to be named Comcast said.

The company describes the shift as an “evolution” in its strategy to engage customers. New data from Xfinity shows viewership typically doubles during the time a network or streaming service lifts the subscription gate even for a few days.

“At Xfinity we strive to deliver the best entertainment experience to our customers and make it easy for them to access all the programming they subscribe to and also discover new programming that might be of interest to them” said Sophia Ahmad EVP and CMO Comcast Cable. “With Free This Week we are offering customers a no-strings-attached chance to discover something new every week of the year building on the great success previously established with events like Watchathon Week and Free TV Week.”"

While 2022 saw a lot of big projects in process and some lofty ideas pitched this year we should see how downtown Detroit neighborhoods and the metro Detroit region continue to adapt to the changing landscape and needs of the population. Here are a few stories we're keeping an eye on.

Hotel boom

It's well known that Detroit could get more major events if we had the hotel space for visitors. This year we should get an idea of how many will make it online. Currently the Cambria Hotel on the west side of downtown has signage and is moving closer to an opening date. The Godfrey Hotel on Michigan Avenue continues construction in Corktown. And three major projects underway - the Hudson's site Michigan Central and Book Tower - have hotel components. On the horizon the current construction at the former Joe Louis Arena site is for residential but a hotel is planned. Ideas are floating again for a second tower at the Fort Pontchartrain hotel. And Olympia's big vision for the District Detroit include converting the Fox Theater office space into hotels and adding a new hotel next to the Little Caesars Arena.

Filling in the District Detroit

Speaking of Olympia all eyes are on the Ilitch/Ross collaboration to see what actually gets done. The Detroit Center for Innovation will break ground this year and if the schedule goes as planned an office building in front of Comerica Park will break ground and construction will start on building rehabs previously announced. Some think it won't happen because Olympia doesn't have a great track record. Many think the addition of Ross's Related Companies adds some credibility and hope to the plans. We're looking forward to seeing what's to come and if we can build up that part of downtown. The Community Benefits process for the project is currently in progress.

A new life around Michigan Central Station

Ford has been hard at work redeveloping the old train station and the area surrounding it for the past few years. This is the year we should see some of that come to life. The Book Depository is expected to open. The Bagley Mobility Hub is open and the neighboring Southwest Greenway will be completed this year. The reconfiguration of Roosevelt Park will open this year. And we should see parts of the train station itself opening later this year which will be an exciting day in Detroit.

Filling in the Woodward Corridor

Over the past few years we've seen a lot of development between Midtown and Highland Park. This covers a large area (New Center Milwaukee Junction North End Piety Hill Boston-Edison) but the incremental development is adding up. Piety Hill has seen projects completed like the Ruth Ellis Center plus new construction for senior apartments in the Rev. Dr. Jim Holley Residences. The North End has seen many infill projects over the past few years and construction is well underway at the Detroit Food Commons. In Milwaukee Junction the redevelopment of the Studebaker Plant will bring more housing to the neighborhood. We eagerly await the start of construction at a project on the far edges of the area that will have major implications in several neighborhoods - the redevelopment of the Fisher Body Plant.

While there are plenty of neighborhoods and urbanism projects to watch (Eastern Market Brush Park the revamp of East Warren Ave. businesses coming to McNichols the road diet in Ferndale) we want to hear from you. Which projects do you want to learn more about in the upcoming year? Feel free to comment below.

The US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said that the problem was discovered when the establishment notified FSIS after observing spoiled and leaking cans from multiple production dates at the establishment’s warehouse.

The meat and poultry products were produced between Dec. 12 2022 and Jan. 13 2023.

The following products are subject to recall: [view spreadsheet] [view labels].

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “P4247” on the product cans. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

FSIS said that subsequent investigation by Conagra determined that the cans subject to recall may have been damaged in a manner that is not apparent to consumers which may allow foodborne pathogens to enter the cans.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of these products. The agency is concerned that some products may be on retail shelves or in consumers’ pantries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0bGF3cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvY2EtY29sYS1wZmFzLWNvbnN1bWVyLWZyYXVkLWxhd3N1aXQtY29udGludWVzLTIwMjItdHJlbmTSAV9odHRwczovL25hdGxhd3Jldmlldy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb2NhLWNvbGEtcGZhcy1jb25zdW1lci1mcmF1ZC1sYXdzdWl0LWNvbnRpbnVlcy0yMDIyLXRyZW5kP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola PFAS Consumer Fraud Lawsuit Continues 2022 Trend,"On December 28 2022 a PFAS consumer fraud class action lawsuit was filed in New York against Coca-Cola over alleged PFAS content in the Simply Tropical juice products sold by the company. The Coca-Cola PFAS consumer fraud lawsuit is but the latest in a growing line of PFAS lawsuits that allege that certain consumer goods contain PFAS that the products or company’s values were marketed as healthy or environmentally friendly and that consumers would not have purchased the products if they knew that the products contained PFAS.

As we predicted in early 2021 the increased attention on PFAS content in consumer goods in the scientific community and media presented significant risks to various industries and our prediction was that the developments would lead to a significant number of lawsuits alleging consumer fraud. Consumer goods industries insurers and investment companies interested in the consumer goods vertical with niche interest in cosmetics companies must pay careful attention to these lawsuits.

Coca-Cola PFAS Consumer Fraud Lawsuit

On December 28 2022 plaintiff Joseph Lurenz filed a lawsuit in New York seeking a proposed class action against Coca-Cola. The lawsuit alleges that Coca-Cola markets the company and its Simply Tropical products as “all natural” and made with “all natural ingredients” in an effort to attract health-conscious consumers to the products. Further the lawsuit cites the ingredients list for the juice product which indicates the use of “pure filtered water.” The lawsuit alleges that this statement implies to consumers that extra care was taken by the company to remove or avoid the use of chemicals such as PFAS. However with testing showing the presence of PFAS in the juice drink the statements were false misleading or induced consumers to purchase products when the presence of PFAS in the products was not disclosed.

In the Complaint plaintiffs allege the following counts against Coca-Cola:

Violation of state consumer protection laws and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act

Breach of warranty

Fraud

Constructive fraud

Unjust enrichment

The plaintiffs seek certification of a nationwide class action lawsuit with subclasses defined as consumers in New York. In addition the lawsuit seeks damages fees costs and a jury trial.

Just the Beginning For Consumer Products Companies

With studies underway legislation pending that targets consumer goods and increasing media reporting on PFAS in consumer goods and concerns over human health product manufacturers should be increasingly wary of lawsuits similar to the Coca-Cola lawsuit being filed against them. There are an increasing number of PFAS consumer fraud cases being filed with some of the below as representative of recent trends:

Cosmetics industry: Brown v. Cover Girl New York (April 1 2022) Anderson v. Almay New York (April 1 2022) Rebecca Vega v. L’Oreal New Jersey (April 8 2022) Spindel v. Burt’s Bees California (March 25 2022) Hicks and Vargas v. L’Oreal New York (March 9 2022) Davenport v. L’Oreal California (February 22 2022)

Food packaging industry: Richburg v. Conagra Brands Illinois (May 6 2022) Ruiz v. Conagra Brands Illinois (May 6 2022) Hamman v. Cava Group California (April 27 2022) Azman Hussain v. Burger King California (April 11 2022) Little v. NatureStar California (April 8 2022) Larry Clark v. McDonald’s Illinois (March 28 2022)

Feminine hygiene products: Gemma Rivera v. Knix Wear Inc. California (April 4 2022) Blenis v. Thinx Inc. Massachusetts (June 18 2021) Destini Canan v. Thinx Inc. California (November 12 2020)



As the above is indicative of several major companies now find themselves embroiled in litigation focused on PFAS false advertising consumer protection violations and deceptive statements made in marketing and ESG reports. The lawsuits may well serve as test cases for plaintiffs’ bar to determine whether similar lawsuits will be successful in any (or all) of the fifty states in this country. Companies must consider the possibility of needing to defend lawsuits involving plaintiffs in all fifty states for products that contain PFAS.

It should be noted that these lawsuits would only touch on the marketing advertising ESG reporting and consumer protection type of issues. Separate products lawsuits could follow that take direct aim at obtaining damages for personal injury for plaintiffs from consumer products. In addition environmental pollution lawsuits could seek damage for diminution of property value cleanup costs and PFAS filtration systems if drinking water cleanup is required.

Conclusion

It is of the utmost importance that businesses along the whole supply chain in the consumer products industry evaluate their PFAS risk. Public health and environmental groups urge legislators to regulate PFAS at an ever-increasing pace. Similarly state level EPA enforcement action is increasing at a several-fold rate every year. Now the first wave of lawsuits take direct aim at the consumer products industry. Companies that did not manufacture PFAS but merely utilized PFAS in their manufacturing processes are therefore becoming targets of costly enforcement actions at rates that continue to multiply year over year. Lawsuits are also filed monthly by citizens or municipalities against companies that are increasingly not PFAS chemical manufacturers.",,,,,,,,,

Insurance companies are meant to protect against calamity in our society and the worsening of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels is certainly a calamity.

What are examples of the type of proposed projects that the insurance industry should be avoiding? To start it should not be insuring new drilling in Alaska’s arctic.

The coastal plain of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is teeming with life from migratory birds to thousands of caribou to a struggling population of polar bears who are fighting for survival against climate change. The coastal plain is sacred to the Gwich’in who call it “Iizhik Gwats’an Gwandaii Goodlit” (The Sacred Place Where Life Begins). After pushing for decades to be allowed to drill oil companies got one step closer in 2017 with the passage of the Tax Act which authorized the coastal plain oil and gas program. But following a failed lease sale in 2021 four oil companies have actually pulled out of the refuge making us question whether there’s actually any interest in drilling there at all. Committing to deny insurance for coastal plain drilling should be an easy commitment to make. In fact 17 international insurers have already committed not to insure drilling in the refuge.

To the west of the refuge ConocoPhillips Alaska’s largest crude oil producer has proposed the Willow Project. If allowed to move forward it will be the single largest oil extraction project on U.S. federal land. The rising temperatures associated with climate change have made fossil fuel extraction more difficult and costly due to melting permafrost. The financial losses that oil companies would incur should discourage drilling in the arctic. However ConocoPhillips plans to refreeze the tundra using “chillers” and then proceed to drill it for oil. The proposed 30 years of oil drilling from the Willow Project would extract 500 million barrels of petroleum from this snowy sanctuary. The project would single-handedly release annual emissions equivalent to more than 70 new coal fired power plants operating in a given year.

If shareholders for these three companies vote in favor of Green Century’s resolution they will be making it that much harder for oil companies including ConocoPhillips to move forward with their plans to drill in the arctic. That will be good news for the caribou birds polar bears and Indigenous peoples in the arctic and good news for the entire planet; we don’t need more oil drilling. And you can’t drill for oil without insurance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAyLzMtYm9sZC1vaWwtbWFya2V0LXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLWZvci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Bold Oil Market Predictions for 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAyLzMtYm9sZC1vaWwtbWFya2V0LXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLWZvci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E451AB30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Chargers installed for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation allowing EVs to discharge power back into the grid have similar upfront costs to conventional chargers. But they also have the potential to earn money said Melissa Chan director of grid solutions and strategic partnerships at Fermata Energy a tech firm that's developed a V2G platform in a recent presentation for the CHAdeMO Association trade group.

In comparison a conventional unidirectional charger could incur up to $30000 over a projected 10-year life span from maintenance costs according to Fermata. It underscores how in the near future small fleets—and eventually residential users—may be able to take advantage of this technology to reduce their energy and driving costs.

Revel and Fermata Energy V2G pilot program using Nissan Leaf EVs.

Fermata recently participated in a V2G pilot program with Revel which operates moped scooter and ride-share services in New York City. Revel uses a fleet of electric cars for its ride share service and installed Fermata bidirectional chargers at its maintenance and repair depot in New York's Brooklyn borough for the project.

The project involved three of these chargers and three Nissan Leaf hatchbacks. Under an agreement with local utility Con Edison the cars discharged power from their battery packs back into the grid from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on summer weekdays—when energy demand peaked. Revel earned money from this but also had the option to unplug the cars if they were needed.

The three chargers could send up to 45 kw of power into the grid. By discharging during afternoons Monday through Friday the setup could deliver up to 3 megawatt-hours of power monthly according to Fermata. That's with nightly charging of EVs as needed.

2023 Nissan Leaf

The pilot shows how V2G infrastructure could be attractive to fleet operators but it's not necessarily applicable yet on a large scale. Fermata and Revel had a favorable agreement with Con Edison but agreements with local utilities are going to vary widely as individual V2G users negotiate with each utility.

Some progress has been made on enhancing V2G viability recently.

Nissan formally approved Fermata's charger as the first U.S. bidirectional charger for the Leaf earlier in 2022 and California has started to consider V2G charging tech at scale for grid stability. Although a range of automakers have confirmed future bidirectional charging a 2020 rumor that Tesla might try to sneak V2G capability into the Model Y proved to be false.",,,,,,

And Mayor Malik Evans wants to use federal pandemic relief dollars to help offset expenses.

Talk of expanding what's known as the Joseph A. Floreano Rochester Riverside Convention Center dates back years. Past concepts showed soaring glass and steel structures and portals into the old aqueduct and subway bed.

Built in 1985 the facility never has been formally renovated officials said and is sorely in need of investment.

""Other buildings of our age have already expanded and renovated"" said James Brown the convention center’s executive director. ""So it's very important that we stay up with the Joneses so of speak and make sure we have what meeting planners and visitors want.""

The project includes a two-story building addition — to better showcase and interact with the riverfront — and work to shore up the south end of the outdoor riverfront terrace.

Initial estimates were for $10 million but that was several years ago. The bill now stands at $27 million officials said driven by rising labor and materials costs.

Even with the federal dollars and an earlier state award the city is well short.

“They’re looking to raise likely between $5 (million) and $10 million more to do the work"" Deputy Mayor Patrick Cunningham said.

The city hopes to begin construction in 2024 and have the project completed in a couple of years.

""A very important part of the project as this is eventually going to connect to the Aqueduct Reimagined project"" Brown said. ""Creating unity and a good relationship between the other venues that surround us.""

The aqueduct project involves the Broad Street bridge and tearing off some or all of the upper deck roadway creating a pedestrian plaza. Other nearby venues are Blue Cross Arena Constellation Brands' new headquarters and the Rundel Library and park.

In January 2023 the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPP) is poised to launch into orbit a prototype dubbed the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD) which will test several key components of an ambitious plan to harvest solar power in space and beam the energy back to Earth.

Space solar power provides a way to tap into the practically unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space where the energy is constantly available without being subjected to the cycles of day and night seasons and cloud cover.

The launch currently slated for early January represents a major milestone in the project and promises to make what was once science fiction a reality. When fully realized SSPP will deploy a constellation of modular spacecraft that collect sunlight transform it into electricity then wirelessly transmit that electricity over long distances wherever it is needed—including to places that currently have no access to reliable power.

A Momentus Vigoride spacecraft carried aboard a SpaceX rocket on the Transporter-6 mission will carry the 50-kilogram SSPD to space. It consists of three main experiments each tasked with testing a different key technology of the project:

DOLCE (Deployable on-Orbit ultraLight Composite Experiment): A structure measuring 6 feet by 6 feet that demonstrates the architecture packaging scheme and deployment mechanisms of the modular spacecraft that would eventually make up a kilometer-scale constellation forming a power station;

: A collection of 32 different types of photovoltaic (PV) cells to enable an assessment of the types of cells that are the most effective in the punishing environment of space; MAPLE (Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment): An array of flexible lightweight microwave power transmitters with precise timing control focusing the power selectively on two different receivers to demonstrate wireless power transmission at distance in space.

An additional fourth component of SSPD is a box of electronics that interfaces with the Vigoride computer and controls the three experiments.

SSPP got its start in 2011 after philanthropist Donald Bren chairman of Irvine Company and a lifetime member of the Caltech Board of Trustees learned about the potential for space-based solar energy manufacturing in an article in the magazine Popular Science. Intrigued by the potential for space solar power Bren approached Caltech's then-president Jean-Lou Chameau to discuss the creation of a space-based solar power research project. In 2013 Bren and his wife Brigitte Bren a Caltech trustee agreed to make the donation to fund the project. The first of the donations to Caltech (which will eventually exceed $100 million in support for the project and endowed professorships) was made that year through the Donald Bren Foundation and the research began.

""For many years I've dreamed about how space-based solar power could solve some of humanity's most urgent challenges"" Bren says. ""Today I'm thrilled to be supporting Caltech's brilliant scientists as they race to make that dream a reality.""

The rocket will take approximately 10 minutes to reach its desired altitude. The Momentus spacecraft will then be deployed from the rocket into orbit. The Caltech team on Earth plans to start running their experiments on the SSPD within a few weeks of the launch.

DOLCE unfolding

Some elements of the test will be conducted quickly. ""We plan to command the deployment of DOLCE within days of getting access to SSPD from Momentus. We should know right away if DOLCE works"" says Sergio Pellegrino Caltech's Joyce and Kent Kresa Professor of Aerospace and Professor of Civil Engineering and co-director of SSPP. Pellegrino is also a senior research scientist at JPL which Caltech manages for NASA.

Other elements will require more time. The collection of photovoltaics will need up to six months of testing to give new insights into what types of photovoltaic technology will be best for this application. MAPLE involves a series of experiments from an initial function verification to an evaluation of the performance of the system under different environments over time. Meanwhile two cameras on deployable booms mounted on DOLCE and additional cameras on the electronics box will monitor the experiment's progress and stream a feed back down to Earth. The SSPP team hopes that they will have a full assessment of the SSPD's performance within a few months of the launch.

Numerous challenges remain: nothing about conducting an experiment in space—from the launch to the deployment of the spacecraft to the operation of the SSPD—is guaranteed. But regardless of what happens the sheer ability to create a space-worthy prototype represents a significant achievement by the SSPP team.

""No matter what happens this prototype is a major step forward"" says Ali Hajimiri Caltech's Bren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering and co-director of SSPP. ""It works here on Earth and has passed the rigorous steps required of anything launched into space. There are still many risks but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward.""

Although solar cells have existed on Earth since the late 1800s and currently generate about 4 percent of the world's electricity (in addition to powering the International Space Station) everything about solar power generation and transmission needed to be rethought for use on a large scale in space. Solar panels are bulky and heavy making them expensive to launch and they need extensive wiring to transmit power. To overcome these challenges the SSPP team has had to envision and create new technologies architectures materials and structures for a system that is capable of the practical realization of space solar power while being light enough to be cost-effective for bulk deployment in space and strong enough to withstand the punishing space environment.

""DOLCE demonstrates a new architecture for solar-powered spacecraft and phased antenna arrays. It exploits the latest generation of ultrathin composite materials to achieve unprecedented packaging efficiency and flexibility. With the further advances that we have already started to work on we anticipate applications to a variety of future space missions"" Pellegrino says.

""The entire flexible MAPLE array as well as its core wireless power transfer electronic chips and transmitting elements have been designed from scratch. This wasn't made from items you can buy because they didn't even exist. This fundamental rethinking of the system from the ground up is essential to realize scalable solutions for SSPP"" Hajimiri says.

The entire set of three prototypes within the SSPD was envisioned designed built and tested by a team of about 35 individuals. ""This was accomplished with a smaller team and significantly fewer resources than what would be available in an industrial rather than academic setting. The highly talented team of individuals on our team has made it possible to achieve this"" says Hajimiri.

Those individuals however—a collection of graduate students postdocs and research scientists—now represent the cutting edge in the burgeoning space solar power field. ""We're creating the next generation of space engineers"" says SSPP researcher Harry A. Atwater Caltech's Otis Booth Leadership Chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science and the Howard Hughes Professor of Applied Physics and Materials Science and director of the Liquid Sunlight Alliance a research institute dedicated to using sunlight to make liquid products that could be used for industrial chemicals fuels and building materials or products.

Success or failure from the three testbeds will be measured in a variety of ways. The most important test for DOLCE is that the structure completely deploys from its folded-up configuration into its open configuration. For ALBA a successful test will provide an assessment of which photovoltaic cells operate with maximum efficiency and resiliency. MAPLE's goal is to demonstrate selective free-space power transmission to different specific targets on demand.

""Many times we asked colleagues at JPL and in the Southern California space industry for advice about the design and test procedures that are used to develop successful missions. We tried to reduce the risk of failure even though the development of entirely new technologies is inherently a risky process"" says Pellegrino.

Space resilience and the importance of multiple orbits

A LEO constellation is hugely expensive to build and maintain with much shorter lifespans than GEO satellites. While the US and EU have a scale that can potentially justify such sovereign constellations most nations can’t justify this level of expense which is likely to mean using one of the commercial providers such as OneWeb or SpaceX. This puts a reliance in supporting the mission into the hands of a commercial operator potentially reducing freedom of action. This is still of value to de-risk operations through diversification but for resilience and to meet the threat requirement it still requires sovereign GEO satellites at the core. The survivability of using both LEO and GEO communications satellites One way of ensuring survivability of satellites is to use different orbits and to take advantage of cheaper satellites to provide the same service. One such concept is the use of communications satellites on low cost smaller satellites in LEO which while more vulnerable to threats by the sheer numbers of satellites compared with the lower number of communications satellites in GEO are able to provide a sufficient level of communications to military users. This is not to say that they can provide communications in the event of a electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in space like a hardened GEO communications satellite. However having many LEO satellites would make it difficult for an adversary to deny access to satellite communications. This is in terms of geographical limitations of attempting to use lasers and kinetic weapons from the ground as these satellites may not always be in view from aggressor nations. Additionally by having many LEO communications satellites the sheer number of satellites passing overhead over a particular region would make it extremely difficult for a threat nation to completely deny communications. For resilience and to meet the threat requirement it still requires sovereign GEO satellites at the core. The US Department of Defense is working on a feasibility concept of proliferated constellation of satellites in LEO for satellite communications. The idea of building large constellations of small and less expensive satellites to ensure a persistent service is of interest to the commercial market. A satellite communications service in GEO requires a relatively low number of satellites—on the order of less than five—for near-global coverage. Providing the same coverage with a LEO requires several hundred satellites. OneWeb OneWeb is deploying a constellation of 648 small satellites with a mass of around 150 kilograms. It is deployed in LEO with an altitude of 1200 kilometers. The first prototype satellites were launched in February 2019 the deployment phase of the regular satellites commenced in February 2020 with the launch of the first 34 satellite. Initial operating capability for the service was in late 2021. Starlink Starlink is a subsidiary of SpaceX. The planned initial constellation will consist of up to 12000 small satellites each with a mass of around 230 kilograms. They will be deployed in three orbital regimes in LEO. The first 1500 satellites are planned in an orbit of 550 kilometers. The first prototype satellites were launched in May 2019. Starlink proliferated LEO communications satellites Chinese and Russian plans The state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation has planned to have a 300-satellite Hongyan LEO communications constellation. The state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation plans its own 156-satellite Xingyun communications constellation.[1] In 2020 China made an application for 12992 LEO broadband satellites. This was called GuoWang[2]. Russia has also aspirations for LEO constellations. Roscosmos Russia’s space corporation announced plans to build the 288-satellite Efir constellation to provide global broadband by 2025. This is part of larger project to build 600 communications and optical imagery satellites to provide global coverage in LEO.[3] Optical intersatellite links The most critical technology for realizing the potential for proliferated constellations in LEO for satellite communications resides in the link segment and laser communications is fundamental. Space-based optical communications or laser communications is the key to forming the space mesh network.[4] This is critical to provide multiple diversified connectivity paths to route information to and from space at the speed and scale to conduct all-domain operations. Laser communications is important to negate the increasing ability of adversaries to threaten communications networks. Optical inter-satellite links are vital for connectivity between satellites. It is also vital that optical communications terminals are integrated for terrestrial and airborne systems to enable data to be sent and received in an operational setting. This infrastructure would require the wider adoption of phased array antennas capable of handling the rapid and continuous satellite beam handovers to the operation of the LEO and MEO constellations. Flexible terminals capable of seamlessly roaming across different governmental and commercial networks would be required to span the orbital regimes and operate over different frequency bands waveforms and security levels. Optical inter-satellite links and satellite-to-ground communications Vulnerability of proliferated LEO communications Lt. Gen. Stephen N. Whiting commander of the US Space Force’s Space Operations Command acknowledges the risks of LEO communications constellations that are networked not only with the receivers on the ground but also with each other. This connectivity means increased cyberattack surface. Each additional node added to a constellation creates links that add risk.[5] Cybersecurity is the soft underbelly of these global networks. New LEO constellations make it more difficult because of the additional connectivity. Some GEO satellite communications operate on a simple bent-pipe principle: a user terminal points a single satellite at a fixed position and sends its signal back down to a ground station connected to a network. In a LEO constellation that features satellites that move swiftly relative to the users on the ground the whole constellation needs to orchestrate connectivity. Satellites user terminals and ground control stations all need to be networked and controlled so that the satellites knows where to send the data it receives.[6] Multiplex connectivity is the source of the capabilities of a new LEO constellation but its attack surface is broader which means more entry points into the network for an adversary. One way to mitigate this risk is the use of encryption. However if everything is going to be hardened then cost is going to increase. There is a delicate balance between cyber-hardening versus potentially accepting more risk to get data quicker. The nuclear command control and communications domain is risk-averse and the idea of accepting that risk is likely to be an anathema. Nuclear hardening There is no way to harden a satellite against a nuclear explosion that comes close to a satellite. The main effects of nuclear is the thermal pulse followed by radiation and particle emissions. One way to counter this to distribute the satellite constellation in GEO so that one nuclear explosion could destroy no more than one satellite; of course to achieve global coverage in LEO a large constellation would be required and they could not be dispersed. Satellites are usually thousands of kilometers apart while the lethal range of a one-megaton explosion against a satellite with a feasible level of hardness is under 100 kilometers.[7] However if the nuclear detonation is further away the EMP effects can be overcome. High-altitude bursts generate an EMP that can couple into unprotected circuits and can cause burnout. Incorporating Faraday cage filter surge arrestor waveguide cutoff and fiber-optic technology in the ground site design can provide a level of protection against this threat. Multiplex connectivity is the source of the capabilities of a new LEO constellation but its attack surface is broader which means more entry points into the network for an adversary. To provide assured communications to support the nuclear command and control (C2) of strategic nuclear forces protected satellite communications users need to be able to operate in a nuclear contested environment. The extra costs associated with provided this assured hardened capability means that it uneconomical to have a proliferated network of satellites in LEO to provide these strategic communications. The satellites providing nuclear C2 have traditionally been located in GEO and in smaller numbers than envisaged under the proliferated LEO communications concept. The GEO belt by its nature of being 36000 kilometers away from the Earth affords it a greater level of security from from adversary ASAT weapons such as direct-ascent ASATs like as China’s operational DN-1 and Russia’s Nudol program that was successfully tested in November 2021. However adversary nations do have kinetic ASAT programs like as China’s DN-2 that could reach the GEO belt. However these ASAT missiles would take four to five hours to intercept. This advanced warning time could permit strategic communications valuable warning time to develop a defensive capability against such ASAT systems.[8] A Russian ASAT test on 15 November 2021. Nudol successfully intercepted Russian Cosmos 1408 orbit in blue using a direct-ascent Nudol kinetic weapon. The red depiction is the debris field depicted by AGI. Early warning satellites China and Russia are developing multiple ASAT weapons to target current US space-based warning satellites which are in predictable orbits. To address this space threat a multi-orbit system of systems that can detect non-ballistic missiles from launch to their designated target areas is proposed. A multi-layered space-based architecture in LEO MEO GEO and polar orbits[9] is recommended to not only detect missiles at all altitudes but also to provide fire control information in near-realtime. Resilience could be further enhanced by deploying satellites that are capable of enhanced maneuver to avoid ASATs; this capability tends towards smaller detection satellites in LEO. Additionally deploying decoys in LEO MEO and GEO would complicate an adversary’s attacks. Space Based Infrared System Architecture The SBIRS architecture consists of five dedicated GEO and two host satellites in HEO. The constellation in these orbits provides a persistent stare over large geographic areas to detect missile launches. The advantages of GEO are readily apparent but the relatively low number of satellites offers a target to adversarial nations. This has led to the concept of a mesh of sensors in a wider range of orbits such as LEO and MEO to provide a vital level of redundancy in a contested space arena. Proliferated LEO Tracking Layer concept The US Space Development Agency (SDA) was founded in 2019 with the task of rapidly launching hundreds of satellites for the National Defense Space Architecture. The first launch will be Tranche 0 expected in early 2023 with 28 satellites that will provide communications for US and allied forces. Tranche 1 consists of 126 satellites to be launched starting in 2024 with a further 18 experimental satellites to follow.[10] Tranche 1 is a network of small satellites in LEO to expand the ability to detect and track missiles using low latency data connectivity. The SDA is planning to place constellations ib orbits of 1000-1200 kilometers because in orbits below 600 kilometers are becoming increasingly congested placing satellites at risk from the increasing amount of space debris there. Final modelling for the constellation varies with as few as three hundred to more than five hundred satellites potentially envisaged. The Space Development Agency plan to establish the Tranche 1 Transport Layer a mesh of 126 optical interconnected space vehicles to be launched in 2024 An advantage of a proliferated LEO or p-LEO constellation is the added resilience that tens and perhaps hundreds of satellites provides. This number presents to an adversary an overwhelming number of potential targets. While this may increase resiliency from kinetic threats such as the Russian NUDOL and Nivelir and China’s DN-1 direct ascent systems due to sheer numbers the non-kinetic counterspace threats such as radio frequency jamming and high-power microwave weapons could affect multiple satellites in LEO albeit for a limited amount of time.[11] Given the rapid growth in non-kinetic counterspace threats by adversarial nations a resilient survivable missile warning architecture would have to include systems in MEO and GEO. Comparing fields of view in LEO MEO and GEO GEO-based satellites provide near-persistent stare for boost-phase missile detection while providing simultaneous monitoring of specific theaters for shorter range ballistic missile detection. Given the rapid growth in non-kinetic counterspace threats by adversarial nations a resilient survivable missile warning architecture would have to include systems in MEO and GEO. While proponents of each or the orbital regimes can highlight the strengths of the individual orbits the resilience and advantage comes from a complementary set of orbital regimes. The multi-layered approach provides resiliency and survivability across the adversary’s spectrum of counterspace arsenal. Russia and China have threatened to destroy entire orbital regimes particularly LEO but to successfully prosecute a counterspace campaign against all three orbital regimes at the same time would be a significant challenge. Satellite operators would likely be able to fill gaps in coverage by those surviving systems if some are disabled in LEO and MEO. Proliferated LEO satellites for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) Large constellations of ISR satellites offer a high temporal revisit rate. However large constellations of small satellites are presently limited in ground resolution due to the compact size of the satellites limiting the optics or the SAR sensors either in size or in transmission power.[12] A large number of ISR satellites are harder to counter whether in terms of laser dazzling or jamming by an adversary in comparison to a lower number of higher capable systems in GEO. Planet a US-based company already operates a constellation of over 200 small satellites which offers medium resolution at 3–5 meters. Planet also has 13 SkySats which are 100-kilogram satellites of sub-meter resolution. Planet’s satellites are sun-synchronous or other polar orbits. In November 2017 it achieved a major milestone of capturing the Earth’s landmass once per day.[13] Planet constellation scanning the Earth GEO ISR assets China has deployed a GAOFEN-4 imagery satellite in GEO orbit that is reportedly designed to track US carriers. That permits it to observe the Asia Pacific with near persistency.[14] China similarly has at least one satellite the QIANSHAO-3 (QS-3) or Tongxin Jishu Shiyan Weixing satellite that is a signals intelligence satellite in GEO. It is likely that China plans to expand both imaging and signals intelligence constellations. In 2017 QS-3 was the first of China’s satellites to carry a large mesh antenna with a diameter of 32 meters that is designed for signals ingelligence operations.[15] A Russian satellite produced by ISS Reshetnev is intended to intercept signals from foreign communications satellites in GEO. Olymp/Luch was launched in September 2014 and has been travelling across the GEO belt near commercial communications satellites for periods ranging from several weeks to several months.[16] It was built for the Russian Ministry of Defence and the Russian intelligence agency FSB. It is likely that the US uses the GEO belt to provide both EO and SIGINT capabilities for military users. China’s ground-based laser ASAT at Xinjiang Province The use of the GEO belt for to provide ISR imagery for military users ensures that these assets cannot presently be targeted by ground-based laser directed energy weapon (LDEW) systems. China is actively pursuing LDEW for counterspace use and is likely to have an operational capability within the next five years which could dazzle and potential damage a satellite’s imaging sensors in LEO. Russia similarly has been working on LDEW programs for dazzling and damaging imaging satellites in LEO. The GEO belt in the next five to ten years is likely to be outside of the technical capabilities of adversarial nation’s capabilities to interfere using LDEW against GEO ISR satellites. It would therefore be prudent to use GEO for ISR capabilities to augment any proliferated LEO constellation.

Utilities giant Exelon will remain headquartered in Chicago reported Crain’s Chicago Business. Its new CEO Calvin Butler is relocating from Baltimore back to Chicago.

With the exception of Chicago’s Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) every electric utility Exelon owns is in the East including Baltimore Gas & Electric (BGE). Accordingly there was some trepidation in Chicago about the future of one of its largest corporate headquarters Crain’s reported.

Exelon spun off its power-generation business last year which included the nation’s largest fleet of nuclear plants. That unit now dubbed Constellation Energy Group was headquartered in Baltimore.

Butler began his career at Exelon in Chicago as a lobbyist for ComEd before decamping to Baltimore to lead BGE. Upon his return to the city he’s joining the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. He continues as a board member of Bradley University in Peoria his alma mater.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlZmxpZ2h0bm93LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzAyL3NwYWNlLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWV4cGVyaW1lbnQtMzYtcGxhbmV0LWVhcnRoLWltYWdpbmctc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1vbi1zcGFjZXgtcmlkZXNoYXJlLW1pc3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Space solar power experiment 36 Planet imaging satellites on SpaceX rideshare mission – Spaceflight Now,"The 114 small satellites set for launch Tuesday on SpaceX’s first mission of the year include 36 spacecraft for Planet’s commercial remote sensing fleet a space-based solar power experiment and space tugs to piggyback payloads into different orbits.

SpaceX’s Transporter 6 mission will be the company’s sixth dedicated small satellite rideshare launch and is the first of up to 100 rocket flights on SpaceX’s schedule in 2023. The payloads aboard the mission range in size from a soda can to a laundry machine.

Liftoff is set for 9:56 a.m. EST (1456 GMT) Tuesday from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. A 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket will head south from Florida’s Space Coast powered by nine Merlin kerosene-fueled Merlin engines generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust targeting a polar sun-synchronous orbit some 326 miles (525 kilometers) above Earth.

The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will detach and return to Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral about eight-and-a-half minutes after launch. The rocket is set to make its 15th flight into space tying a record set last month for the most-flown Falcon 9 booster.

Meanwhile the Falcon 9’s upper stage will fire its single Merlin engine two times to place the 114 small satellites into orbit. The payload deployments will begin at T+plus 58 minutes and 24 seconds and conclude at T+plus 1 hour and 31 minutes.

There’s high demand for SpaceX’s rideshare launch service. Several SpaceX customers have said the price for a slot on a Transporter mission is unmatched in the launch industry.

On its website SpaceX says it charges customers $1.2 million to launch a payload of 440 pounds (200 kilograms) on a dedicated rideshare flight to sun-synchronous orbit. The price is enabled by cost reductions from reusing Falcon 9 rocket hardware. SpaceX has blamed inflation for hiking the price for a 440-pound payload slot from $1 million.

Broker companies like Berlin-based Exolaunch the Italian launch broker D-Orbit and ISILaunch reserved ports on the Transporter 6 payload stack then divided that capacity among multiple small satellite customers.

One of ISILaunch’s customers on Transporter 6 is Planet the San Francisco-based remote sensing company. Planet says it has 36 SuperDove Earth-imaging satellites each about the size of a toaster oven on-board the Transporter 6 mission.

“We’re excited to again work with SpaceX to bring 36 SuperDoves to orbit our eighth overall launch with the launch provider” said Mike Safyan Planet’s vice president of launch. “Once in orbit these satellites will join our current fleet and work to deliver cutting-edge geospatial solutions to our global customer base.”

The new satellites will replenish Planet’s current fleet of around 200 active satellites the largest Earth-observing constellation in the world the company said. The SuperDove satellites each have optical cameras with sensors in eight spectral bands supplying remote sensing data to commercial customers the U.S. government’s intelligence agencies and environmental monitoring groups.

Five of the SuperDove satellites are adorned with laser-etched artwork and quotes celebrating the legacy of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry according to Planet.

The Transporter 6 mission will also deploy a roughly 400-pound (178-kilogram) satellite for EOS Data Analytics a Silicon Valley startup founded by Max Polyakov a Ukrainian entrepreneur and investor. The EOS SAT 1 spacecraft is designed to capture medium to high resolution images of Earth’s surface with an emphasis on agricultural monitoring. It is one of the largest satellites on the Transporter 6 launch and was built by Dragonfly Aerospace in South Africa.

There are six commercial space tugs and orbital transfer vehicles on the Transporter 6 mission each capable of carrying multiple smaller satellites into different orbits for “last-mile” delivery in low Earth orbit.

The space tugs can change their altitude inclination or other orbital parameters hauling small payloads to different locations in space than the drop-off orbit of the main rocket. The transfer vehicles can reposition small satellites into orbits more favorable for their missions.

Some transfer vehicles use conventional propulsion with thrusters powered by liquid propellants. Others are testing electric thrusters a lower-thrust but higher-efficiency propulsion option.

Two of the transfer vehicles on the Transporter 6 mission come from the Italian company D-Orbit which will deploy several nanosatellites into orbit in the weeks after launch. D-Orbit’s two ION satellite carriers will release four small satellites for a data relay and asset tracking constellation owned by the Swiss company Astrocast. One of the ION tugs will also deploy Kelpie a 9-pound (4-kilogram) CubeSat to provide maritime tracking services for Orbcomm.

Another orbital transfer vehicle developed by a startup named Launcher is also mounted on the Transporter 6 payload stack. Launcher’s Orbiter SN1 space tug is fitted with a ethane/nitrous oxide propulsion system to change its orbital altitude and inclination and the company says the vehicle is capable of accommodating up to 880 pounds (400 kilograms) of payload mass.

The Orbiter SN1 mission carries deployable satellites for U.S.-based Skyline Celestial Innova Space of Argentina Italy’s NPC SpaceMind Cal Poly Pomona Stanford University and an undisclosed customer. The spacecraft also hosts a payload containing cremated human remains for Beyond Burials and a phased array antenna from CesiumAstro to demonstrate a high-data rate Ka-band communications system that could be used on future small satellites in Earth orbit and at the moon.

An Australian company named Skykraft is also launching a 660-pound (300-kilogram) payload on the Transporter 6 mission. The Skykraft package includes the company’s own orbital transfer vehicle which will separate from the Falcon 9 rocket and then later deploy four of its own satellites for Skykraft’s planned constellation of 210 spacecraft providing air traffic management services. Skykraft says its satellites will relay real-time communications between air traffic control and pilots flying over remote parts of the ocean.

San Francisco-based Epic Aerospace will also launch its first orbital transfer vehicle called Chimera LEO 1 on the Transporter 6 mission. Epic Aerospace has not said if its first transfer vehicle will deploy any customer payloads or if the mission is purely a technology demonstration.

And Momentus’s second orbital space tug called the Vigoride 5 Orbital Service Vehicle is set to ride to space Tuesday on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. The Vigoride 5 Orbital Service Vehicle or OSV follows Momentus’s first space tug demo mission which launched on SpaceX’s Transporter 5 rideshare mission in May.

The first Momentus demonstration mission ran into trouble soon after separating from the Falcon 9 rocket. The Vigoride 3 transfer vehicle encountered communications issues and failed to open its solar arrays putting the spacecraft in a power crunch that prevented it from completing all mission objectives. Momentus said the Vigoride 3 space tug eventually released seven of its nine customer satellite payloads.

Momentus hopes to test the Vigoride transfer vehicle’s water-based microwave electrothermal thruster system a type of propulsion system that provides higher efficiency than conventional rocket fuels and higher thrust than ion engines.

The Vigoride 5 space tug will deploy a small CubeSat into orbit for Qosmosys a Singapore-based space venture.

The other payload on the Vigoride 5 space tug comes from Caltech which is flying hardware that could be used in the future to generate electricity in space and beam the energy back to Earth for use on the ground.

The 110-pound (50-kilogram) Space Solar Power Demonstrator payload will test a scaled-down 6-by-6-foot deployable structure that simulates mechanisms needed to construct a huge power generation station in space. Engineers will also evaluate the performance of 22 types of solar cells to determine which design is most effective and test microwave power transmitters needed to beam energy back to Earth.

“No matter what happens this prototype is a major step forward” said Ali Hajimiri a professor of electrical engineering at Caltech and co-director of the institution’s Space Solar Power Project. “It works here on Earth and has passed the rigorous steps required of anything launched into space. There are still many risks but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward.”

The solar power experiment’s deployable structure employs “ultra-thin composite materials to achieve unprecedented packaging efficiency and flexibility” Caltech said in a press release.

“The entire flexible (microwave) array as well as its core wireless power transfer electronic chips and transmitting elements have been designed from scratch” Hajimiri said. “This wasn’t made from items you can buy because they didn’t even exist. This fundamental rethinking of the system from the ground up is essential to realize scalable solutions for SSPP (Space Solar Power Project).”

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket is also loaded with three radar remote sensing microsatellites for the Finnish company ICEYE and two similar radar imaging satellites for Umbra a startup based in Santa Barbara California.

There are four optical Earth observation microsatellites on-board for Satellogic a remote sensing company headquartered in Uruguay. Two of them will be primarily used to survey Albanian territory through an agreement between Satellogic and the Albanian government.

The Transporter 6 mission will also deploy two 132-pound (60-kilogram) spacecraft for Lynk Global a Virginia-based company developing technology to connect consumer-grade mobile phones through satellites. A satellite called YAM 5 — Yet Another Mission 5 — from Loft Orbital is also aboard the Falcon 9 rocket. YAM 5 is a “condosat” hosting several customer tech demo payloads including a flight computer an infrared camera and telecom systems.

A U.S. Space Force weather mission on the Transporter 6 launch will test a prototype cloud imaging instrument called the Rapid Revisit Optical Cloud Imager or RROCI. The Space Force instrument is hosted on a small satellite developed by Orion Space Solutions.

Two military satellites from Norway and the Netherlands will work in tandem to demonstrate the military use of a microsatellite spectrum monitoring system to detect and geolocate radar emissions.

A satellite named Sternula 1 owned by the Danish company Sternula will test a VHF communications system for maritime communications. A briefcase-size spacecraft named NSLSat 2 will be the second satellite launched for the Israeli company NSLComm which is developing a constellation of smallsats for high-throughput communications.

The Transporter 6 mission will launch four new satellites for Kleos Space of Luxembourg which operates a fleet of spacecraft to detect and geolocate radio frequency transmissions providing intelligence on maritime activity for governments and commercial customers. Another small satellite called STAR VIBE from Scanway Space a Polish company will validate the performance of two optical payloads one for Earth observation and another for satellite self-inspection.

Other CubeSat payloads on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket include the BRO-8 satellite for the French maritime surveillance company Unseenlabs the Menut Earth observation spacecraft from the Spanish company Open Cosmos the Guardian Alpha tech demo satellite for the UK company OrbAstro and the Connecta T1.2 testbed for the Turkish internet of things company Plan-S.

A satellite named Platform 2 from the Bulgarian firm EnduroSat is also on-board. It is another “condosat” mission to support testing of several customer payloads including plasma and arc-based thrusters from Magdrive and Hypernova.

A French CubeSat called Gama Alpha will unfurl a 789-square-foot (73.3-square-meter) solar sail in low Earth orbit and attempt to harness light energy from the sun as a means of propulsion. Sony’s Star Sphere CubeSat carries a full-frame camera with a 28-135 mm lens. Sony says selected artists and space enthusiasts will be able to command the camera to take pictures of Earth sunrises and sunsets the moon and stars.

There are also six CubeSats on the Transporter 6 mission for Spire Global’s constellation satellites for ship tracking and weather data collection plus 12 tiny “picosats” for Swarm Technologies a company owned by SpaceX. Swarm is developing a low-data-rate satellite communications system. Each of the Swarm satellites is about the size of a slice of bread.

The Transporter 6 launch will also place into orbit a small CubeSat from Ukraine to test thermal control technology Kuwait’s first satellite mission and an amateur radio CubeSat from the Czech Republic.

FREETOWN Mass. (WLNE) — 30 cars are damaged after a fire broke out in an auto auction lot in Freetown.

According to Freetown fire officials they responded to a call for a reported brush fire around 11:30 p.m. Dec. 31.

Given the warm and rainy weather at the time officials said they knew it was not brush related.

Responders arrived to the Copart Auto Auction in Freetown where about 20 cars were already on fire.

Fire officials called in all available personnel to help battle the blaze.

Firefighters were able to contain the fire before it spread to the hundreds of other vehicles in the lot.

According to officials 30 cars sustained heavy damage from the fire.

There were no reported injuries and the cause of the blaze is still under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3lvdS1jYW4tYnV5LXRoYXQtZm9yZC1tdXN0YW5nLWFuZC1jaGV2eS1jYW1hcm8tbWFzaHVwLWJ1dC10aGVyZXMtc29tZS1kYW1hZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Buy That Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro Mashup but There's Some Damage,"This unholy union of a Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang has sadly met a destructive end. Some creations are simply too beautiful for this world. But there's a silver lining to everything: You now have a chance to buy it and fix it up yourself.

The vehicle in question may look like it was built around an S197 Mustang with the face of a Camaro grafted onto the front. However the truth is more complex. The front end chassis and interior appear to be from the Camaro while the roof and tail end are from the Ford. We first spotted this automotive chimera back in 2019 when it was still a whole and running vehicle. Since then it's befallen a nasty fate and wound up for sale on Copart.

Copart

From the sale listing the photos indicate the vehicle has suffered a front-end collision of some sort. The fancy front bumper is badly damaged. It appears to have hit something roughly at headlight height given the huge hole punched where the Chevy badge would usually be.

Behind that it's likely the radiator and support have taken a beating too. The vented hood is also popped up and may be twisted or bent. Under the hood though everything still appears to be roughly in place. Carnage beyond the front bar appears to be limited.

The photos give us a better look at this car than when we saw it last. It appears to have a front bumper akin to the 2017 Camaro ZL1 while the hood appears to be from a 2015 Camaro Z/28. Given the nature of the build though it's likely that some or all of the parts are custom or aftermarket instead. Under the hood it appears to be a fifth-gen Camaro drivetrain. The lack of an engine cover and other details makes it difficult to pin down precisely.

Copart

Notably there's clearly a red tow strap hanging out of the front bumper as well as a racing wheel inside the car. It suggests that the car may have come to grief out on the track though we have no way of confirming that theory. What we do know is that the vehicle was registered in New York as it bears an inspection sticker indicating the vehicle's modified status.

The car currently has 46328 miles on the clock and apparently runs and drives. Copart estimates the retail value of the car at $25000. That's less than half what you would expect to pay for a low-mileage Camaro Z/28 of this era. Overall the custom build appears to be fairly well constructed although careful inspection in person would be key. Some points that stand out at a glance are a missing fuse panel on the dash and interior trims in the rear seating area.

If you fancy the weird aesthetics and are looking for a project that's not too nice to tinker with this could be the car for you. If you're a diehard anti-Ford GM fanatic though perhaps you ought to keep looking.

Yes. I'm growing very worried over what might happen.

If it keeps up I might be a little more concerned.

Now that everyone’s back to work Fierce was able to get a few more details about this JV which is named Gigapower.

AT&T said it wasn’t prepared yet to talk about locations and build plans for the new wholesale fiber network. However a spokesperson said “Gigapower is expected to help AT&T bring fiber service to the Mesa Arizona area with commercialization expected to begin in 2023.”

AT&T was active in the Mesa market in the second half of 2022. In August Corning said it would build a new factory in Gilbert Arizona to manufacture optical cable. And it was doing this to support demand for cable from AT&T and others.

Concurrent with Corning’s announcement AT&T announced plans to deploy fiber service in Mesa making it the sixth operator to target the Phoenix suburb.

A few of the operators targeting the Mesa market are planning to build open-access fiber networks which they can lease to other providers. AT&T’s work in Mesa will fall into the open-access category.

Recently AT&T COO Jeff McElfresh indicated the operator is experimenting in markets like Mesa to see what happens when it deploys fiber outside of its traditional ILEC footprint.

Fierce asked if Gigapower already has an experienced management team in place or if the team is all brand new and recently hired.



AT&T said Gigapower “has a management team that represents decades of experience in telecommunications.” The team will develop and operate the Gigapower network separate from AT&T. Bill Hogg CEO of Gigapower spent about 20 years at AT&T before retiring as President of Technology Operations in 2018.

Why does AT&T want to build out of footprint while it’s still aiming toward 30 million locations in footprint?



AT&T said there is high customer demand for fiber and it wants to satisfy the demand both in and out of its footprint “provided we can earn an appropriate return on our investment.”



“When expanding outside our existing wireline service area it’s likely to be in both rural and metropolitan communities – but the commonality will be that these areas are not places currently widely served with fiber” said AT&T. “Such fiber deployments will also support our wireless business.”

There’s a lot of money about to be distributed to states via the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program to deploy fiber broadband. AT&T acknowledged that Gigapower is working with state and local governments to create public-private partnerships to build broadband networks using federal money allocated for that purpose.

The elephant in the room is: virtually every industry in America is experiencing worker shortages right now. Typically when incumbent service providers are asked if they have enough workers to deploy all this new fiber infrastructure their answer is that they have long planning horizons and have lined up the necessary workers far in advance.

But Gigapower is a new entity.

When asked about the worker pipeline AT&T said “We are confident in the ability of the Gigapower team to meet the build goals that they have set deploying a reliable multi-gig fiber network to an initial 1.5 million customer locations across the nation using a commercial open access platform.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yODY5NjM5L21pY3JvY2Fycmllci1tYXJrZXQtYnVzaW5lc3MtaW5zaWdodHMtb2YtbGVhZGluZy1wbGF5ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microcarrier Market Business Insights of Leading Players Forecast 2023-2032,"Microcarrier Market Business Insights of Leading Players Forecast 2023-2032 | Thermo Fisher Scientific Corning Incorporated Merck Lonza Group

This is particularly difficult for Richmond residents who previously were able to afford to live work and create in the city while maintaining a decent lifestyle. However in the past three years rent prices have significantly increased forcing people to either purchase a home if they can or move to a different part of the city.

According to data from CoStar Group back in May 2022 the average rent in Richmond has increased by $123 per month and nationwide rent has increased by 17.6% compared to the previous year according to the Apartment List National Rent Report. Landlords and property managers argue that they are simply keeping up with the market and what other landlords are charging. Experts attribute the rising rent prices to a variety of factors including the impact of the pandemic on the housing market leading to a shortage of affordable housing and a decrease in vacancies as well as rising inflation and supply chain shortages that have delayed new construction. Some states such as Oregon have implemented laws that limit rent increases but it is unlikely that these regulations will be implemented in Virginia.

According to Rent.com the average rent for apartments in Richmond VA in 2023 ranges from $1305 for a studio apartment to $1672 for a 2-bedroom apartment. The average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in Richmond is $1474.

If you’re looking for more affordable options consider neighborhoods like Northside where the average 1-bedroom apartment rent is $700 or Chamberlayne Industrial Center where the average rent is also $700. Other budget-friendly options include Northrop where the average 1-bedroom apartment rent is $762 Meadowbook ($800) or Chimborazo ($905).

On the more expensive end neighborhoods like Scott’s Addition ($1912) Carytown – Museum District ($1754) and Stony Point ($1680) have higher average rents for 1-bedroom apartments. Other premium neighborhoods include Old Town Manchester ($1605) and Tobacco Row ($1595).

Popular neighborhoods in Richmond with 1-bedroom apartment rents around the city’s average include Carver ($1125) Chamberlayne Industrial Center ($700) and The Fan ($1125). Other popular neighborhoods with similar rents include Monroe Ward ($1166) and West Grace Street ($1125).

Here are a few ideas on how we can work to get rent prices under control.

Rent control policies: Some cities have implemented rent control policies which limit the amount that landlords can charge for rent on certain properties. It’s worth exploring whether such a policy would be feasible in Richmond and how it might impact the housing market. Increasing the supply of affordable housing: One way to address high rent prices is by increasing the supply of affordable housing options. This could involve encouraging the development of more affordable housing units or offering incentives to landlords who make their units available at lower rents. Providing financial assistance to low-income renters: Another approach is to provide financial assistance to low-income renters such as through vouchers or tax credits to help them afford higher rent prices. Promoting alternative housing options: There are also alternative housing options that may be more affordable than traditional rentals such as shared housing or tiny homes. Exploring these options and how they could be made more widely available in Richmond could be a useful.

Hopefully the city will take some of these ideas under consideration and it is worth starting the conversation with our audience about this issue because it is a major problem right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2RldHJvaXQuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvZm9ybWVyLWxlbGxpcy1pbm4tc2l0ZS1kZXRyb2l0LXNvbGQtdmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Lelli's restaurant site in Detroit sold to VA for Fisher House project,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate-insider/former-lellis-inn-site-detroit-sold-va on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2RldHJvaXQuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvZm9ybWVyLWxlbGxpcy1pbm4tc2l0ZS1kZXRyb2l0LXNvbGQtdmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3dlc3RmaWVsZC1zb3V0aC1zaG9yZS1iYXktc2hvcmUtdW5pYmFpbC1yb2RhbWNvLXdlc3RmaWVsZC11cnctbWFsbC1seHlubGJlbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy93ZXN0ZmllbGQtc291dGgtc2hvcmUtYmF5LXNob3JlLXVuaWJhaWwtcm9kYW1jby13ZXN0ZmllbGQtdXJ3LW1hbGwtbHh5bmxiZWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Westfield South Shore mall sells as part of $196M deal,"A Paris-based real estate company has sold its second Long Island mall in two years as it tries to reduce its debt by unloading its U.S. retail properties.

Westfield South Shore in Bay Shore and Westfield Trumbull in Trumbull Connecticut were sold by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield for $196 million Friday URW said in a statement Tuesday.

The buyer was a Great Neck-based partnership formed by Namdar Realty Group a commercial real estate investment firm; Mason Asset Management a real estate investment and advisory company; and CH Capital Group said Michael Czerepka a spokesman for the partnership.

Since URW also sold Sunrise Mall in Massapequa in 2020 it no longer owns any Long Island properties.

Built in 1963 Westfield South Shore is 1.2 million square feet in size.

The mall is 89% leased according to URW’s statement. It has 68 stores and 25 restaurants according to its website. Anchor tenants include Macy’s JCPenney and Dick’s Sporting Goods.

These days more mall operators are choosing to reduce their retail holdings due to the uncertainty in the retail market and/or the high costs of upgrading the properties for modern shopping trends said Thomas LaSalvia a senior economist at Moody's Analytics CRE a Manhattan-based real estate information provider.

But Westfield South Shore is performing well compared to many of its mall peers despite being an older midsize mall with traditional anchors characteristics that have hurt other malls he said.

Westfield South Shore’s vacancy rate has risen over the past few years but its rent growth has been strong at $40 per square foot in November compared to the average of $25 per square foot in the Islip/Smithtown submarket LaSalvia said.

“Competition is somewhat limited on this part of the Island and the neighborhood location is actually a bit of an asset. Our Commercial Location Score which is an index of a variety of locational economic indicators has this property in the 88th percentile of the submarket with strong marks for economic prosperity and safety” he said.

The new ownership group did not respond to a Newsday inquiry about its plans for the mall including whether a redevelopment would occur.

'Radical reduction'

Australia-based Westfield Corp. bought Westfield South Shore then known as South Shore Mall from Macy’s Acquiring Corp. in 1986. In 2005 Westfield bought Sunrise Mall in Massapequa from the Muss-Tankoos Corp.

In 2017 French property investor Unibail-Rodamco bought Westfield which then owned 35 shopping centers and malls in the United States and Britain forming Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield.

The largest mall operator in Europe URW announced in the spring that it would be reducing its debt by selling its U.S. malls.

""Following the completion of its comprehensive deleveraging program which includes the radical reduction of financial exposure to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023 URW will emerge"" focused on its European ""portfolio of high-quality high-performing assets located in the continent’s wealthiest cities and catchment areas” the company announced in March.

With some of URW’s U.S. malls performing reasonably well the company selling its U.S. assets even at the 30% discount compared to the 2021 valuation that the company estimated will allow URW to reduce debt and focus on its European assets said Brandon Svec national director of U.S. Retail Analytics for the CoStar Group a Washington D.C.-based real estate information provider.

URW has made $1.3 billion to date by selling some of its U.S. properties including Westfield South Shore Westfield Trumbull and Westfield Santa Anita and The Village shopping center in Los Angeles according to its statement.

The company has 21 retail properties left in the United States.

In December 2020 URW sold Sunrise Mall in Massapequa to Sunrise Mall Holdings LLC a joint venture led by Manhattan-based real estate investment trust Urban Edge Properties for $29.7 million a steep decline from the $143 million the property sold for in 2005.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZhbWlseS1zcGVjaWFsaXN0LXZpcnR1YWwtdHJhdmVsLWFnZW50LXRyaXBhYnJvb2QtZ29lcy1pbnRvLXZvbHVudGFyeS1saXF1aWRhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family specialist virtual travel agent...,"UK-based start-up tripAbrood has ceased trading despite having secured seed round backing of senior industry figures for its virtual travel agent for families.

The early-stage OTA which was considered to have potential to establish itself and won the 2020 Travolution Start-Up of the Year stopped taking bookings just before Christmas.

Co-founder former European head of analytics at Bloomberg Alexa-Maria Rathbone Barker has started in a senior European sales role at online real estate specialist CoStar Group according to a post on LinkedIn.

TripAbrood was founded in 2019 ahead of the COVID pandemic and remained in pre-revenue development phase during the international travel shut down.

During this period it won widespread acclaim for responding to the pandemic by creating educational activity packs for school children as it built its database of potential clients.

After the pandemic a beta of the firm’s bespoke AI-powered family travel assistant ‘Skye’ was launched and the company attracted an impressive stable of backers in a £654000 seed funding round.

Investors included Ben Davey former chief executive of Barclays Ventures Vic Walia former global vice president brand marketing at Expedia Group Charles Petruccelli former president of global travel services at American Express Andy Mullinger and James Meekings co-founders of Funding Circle Will Keith former VC and head of sales and origination at PrimaryBid and Michel Taride former group president of Hertz International.

Ahead of an official launch in October in August 2020 tripAbrood appointed a head of growth and was the only travel brand named as a TechRound 100 finalist.

Daniel Tannenbaum co-founder of TechRound said at the time: “TripAbrood’s concept demonstrates some real innovation in using AI with family travel to save people money and offer a more engaging user experience through the chatbots.

“There is no doubt that both holidaymakers and businesses operating in the space will benefit from using and working with tripAbrood.

“The start-up was chosen as a TechRound100 finalist as it ticked a lot of boxes for the judges and we are excited to see the company grow from strength-to-strength.”

TripAbrood declined an opportunity to give Travolution a comment on the decision to go into a member’s voluntary liquidation.

The B2C start-up launched in one of the most challenging economic environments for travel due to the pandemic and the looming post-COVID downturn in the UK and Europe.

NEW ORLEANS — A carjacking victim who was brutally dragged through a gas station lot last February is suing Costco Wholesale Corp. and the owners and managers of its New Orleans store claiming they were negligent and didn’t do enough to protect customers after a string of attacks at the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022.

The lawsuit by local real estate agent Kelleye Rhein and her husband was filed last week in Orleans Parish Civil District Court. It lists seven criminal incidents reported to New Orleans police in less than three months prior to the Feb. 1 attack on Rhein in which two teens pulled up in a white SUV and took her car while she was still pumping gas.

She was dragged along the pavement and states in the lawsuit that she was knocked unconscious was rushed to intensive care and suffered traumatic brain injury skull fractures disfigurement spinal injuries and abrasions and scarring over much of her body.

The lawsuit also names the general manager and two assistant managers at the Costco store in Mid-City and the owner of the Costco property Carrollton Central Plaza Associates a partnership owned by New York real estate mogul Jeffrey Feil according to state records.

Rhein’s petition also names as defendants Tyrese Harris an 18-year-old who was arrested and charged in the carjacking as well as the mother of a minor who was also arrested and charged in the criminal case. Harris was a multiple violent offender who was out on bond at the time of the attack on Rhein.

Rhein’s lawsuit contends Harris and the younger boy were the same perpetrators who attempted to carjack someone in nearly the same manner at the Costco gas station on Jan. 31 less than 24 hours before Rhein was victimized at 2:40 p.m. Feb. 1.

Video of the Jan. 31 incident showed a white SUV which the lawsuit says was the same vehicle allegedly used by Harris and the other teen the next day and one of the teens getting out and trying to take a car. They fled on Jan. 31 however after the woman pumping gas on the passenger side ran to the driver’s side and appeared to push the assailant back into the SUV.

The lawsuit also lists carjackings in the Costco main parking lot on Nov. 10 and 12 2021 reports of car burglaries in the parking lot on Dec. 6 and Dec. 20 and two other carjackings at the gas station in little over a month prior to the attack on Rhein on Dec. 27 and Jan. 16.

A few days after Rhein was carjacked the lawsuit says Costco had private security and an NOPD vehicle guarding the gas station. Costco also laid out cones to block the middle lane between two sets of gas pumps to prevent vehicles like the white SUV from pulling up next to customers while they are pumping gas.

Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit Tuesday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29sLmNvbS90aGUtYXNjZW50L3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZXMvaGVyZXMtd2h5LWNvc3Rjb3Mtcm90aXNzZXJpZS1jaGlja2VuLWlzLXN0aWxsLXRoZS1iZXN0LWRlYWwtaW4tdGhlLXN0b3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Costco's Rotisserie Chicken Is Still the Best Deal in the Store,"If you shop at Costco you may have noticed how affordable the rotisserie chickens are. This item is a cost-effective way to prepare an easy meal whether you're planning to shred the chicken and use it for soup make chicken pot pies or whip up a quick chicken salad. But have you ever wondered why Costco sells its rotisserie chickens for such a low price? Keep reading to find out why this is still one of Costco's best deals.

Cheap buys get customers in the door

You probably know someone who raves about the prices of Costco's rotisserie chicken -- and for a good reason. It's a steal. Each chicken sold at the store is around three pounds or slightly over so while you're paying $4.99 for the entire chicken the per-pound price works out to be $1.66. It's no wonder why so many shoppers stop here for this budget-friendly buy.

But why does Costco price this food item so low? Well Costco wants to entice more people to become members and get more customers in the door. Selling rotisserie chickens at such a low price is a great way to attract more customers. It's a winning strategy for Costco.

You're probably going to buy more than chicken

Rotisserie chickens are a good bargain especially for busy families looking for a convenient meal solution that doesn't break the bank. Costco gets you in the door with this deal but another reason the warehouse club prices its rotisserie chicken so low is they know that you're unlikely to walk off with only a chicken in your cart -- even if you try really hard not to spend more money.

Costco is confident that most customers will buy other products while in the store. The retailer even goes as far as to keep its rotisserie chickens in the back of the store so customers have to pass by other products. Once customers see other available deals and buy more than planned Costco makes more money.

Four tips to avoid overspending at Costco

So you recently invested in a Costco membership but want to avoid buying unnecessary items? It can be easy to overspend if you're not cautious but there are techniques that you can follow to keep your spending in check. Here are some tips.

Make a list: Don't walk in the door without bringing a shopping list. This strategy may help you keep your spending on track as you pass by enticing deals that you don't need. Use the retailer's mobile app to check prices: Before you head to your local club take a few moments to check prices in the Costco mobile app. You can use the prices shown to plan your shopping list and ensure you don't break your budget before getting to the checkout line. Figure out which items are a deal: Not everything you see at Costco is sold at a bargain price. While items like the rotisserie chickens are a good buy other items may be priced similarly to traditional retailer prices. Learn what to get at Costco and what items to buy elsewhere to avoid falling for a bad deal. Pay with cash: Using cash is another way to keep your spending in check while at Costco. For some shoppers paying with cash instead of a credit card is a guaranteed way to avoid overspending -- especially if they only keep so much cash in their wallet.

Go ahead and buy that rotisserie chicken at Costco. But don't neglect your personal finance goals in the process. Going in with a plan may help you spend less as you fill your cart with groceries and other essential items. As you develop new shopping habits it may be easier to make spending decisions that don't negatively impact your checking account balance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvdXJ0cy93b21hbi1jYXJqYWNrZWQtYXQtbmV3LW9ybGVhbnMtY29zdGNvLXN1ZXMtcmV0YWlsZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV83OGEwOTA5YS04YmFhLTExZWQtODRmZS1lZmU2NGIzNDBlM2MuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvdXJ0cy93b21hbi1jYXJqYWNrZWQtYXQtbmV3LW9ybGVhbnMtY29zdGNvLXN1ZXMtcmV0YWlsZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV83OGEwOTA5YS04YmFhLTExZWQtODRmZS1lZmU2NGIzNDBlM2MuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This woman was carjacked at the New Orleans Costco.

There was speculation that the fall-out between Joachim and Marie and his mother the Queen had prompted Marie's decision to not attend. But that's not the case. It's since been revealed that her son Count Henrik was ill and so she stayed behind in France to take care of him.

Liverpool Castle once stood in the city centre but can now be found more than 30 miles away.

The original castle constructed in the 13th century was found on land that is now occupied by Derby Square and Liverpool Crown Court at the end of Castle Street. Said to have been built atop a plateau to protect a new port on Lord Street the castle stood until the 18th century.

It was said to have fallen into an advanced state of decay by the 16th century and its final ruins were removed in 1726. The site was then occupied by a church which was then knocked down in the late 19th century and replaced with the Victoria Monument.

The monument on Derby Square contains a plaque which says: ""On this site formerly stood the Castle of Liverpool"". That is not the only nod to it as the brutalist Crown Court building was designed to mimic the castle.

Nowadays if you want to see Liverpool Castle you have to travel to Lancashire. A scale replica of the castle can be found in Lever Park in Rivington near Chorley.

(Image: Lancs Live/Jude Tolson)

Soap tycoon William Lever who established Lever Brothers (later part of Unilever) and was the founder of Port Sunlight commissioned the building of the replica. It was however never finished.

Building work on the castle in Rivington was stopped in 1925 when Lever died. The structure was never meant to resemble the original finished building being based on a part-reconstruction from the late 19th century.

A Grade II listed building the castle and its site has suffered from vandalism crumbling masonry and a collapsed spiral staircase but the ruins are still worth visiting.

The Gothic-style castle still boasts triangular arched doorways and embrasures circular towers and the remains of a stone spiral staircase. Found on the bank of Rivington Reservoir in Lever Park a gift to Bolton's inhabitants from Lever himself Liverpool Castle is worth the hour drive from the city itself.

The Federal Railroad Administration told the GAO that the data are inconclusive about how PSR-related operational changes may have affected safety across the industry. There’s no clear link for example between a railroad’s implementation of PSR and its rates of derailments and employee injuries.

Rail worker complaints to the FRA regarding safety issues have increased sharply however rising from 200 in 2020 to 500 in 2021 and nearly 400 in 2022 through July.

Railroaders and inspectors told the GAO that the combination of fewer maintenance employees and a focus on moving trains out of yards as quickly as possible has resulted in railroads deferring maintenance on track and equipment the report says.

“Some FRA and state inspectors said that as a result of this deferred maintenance in some locations they have seen an increase in certain types of defects in equipment and track such as broken wheels which could lead to accidents and injuries” according to the report which was sent to Congress last month.

The Surface Transportation Board told the GAO that “the extent to which PSR-associated changes have affected freight rail service is unclear” the report says. But shippers told the GAO that they had concerns about paying more for service that’s less frequent and less reliable.

“A shipper that used to receive service from a railroad five days a week may now receive service two days a week with potentially more railcars at one time” the report says. “Four of the seven Class I railroads told us that they chose to reduce the frequency of service to some smaller customers when the railroad could deliver all of the customer’s cars in fewer days of service.”

A lack of sufficient crew and locomotives has hindered railroads’ ability to recover from disruptions one railroad and “other stakeholders” told the GAO.

“Most stakeholders we interviewed stated that—by reducing the number of staff and locomotives to increase asset use—railroads may have reduced the resilience of the rail network to respond to unexpected events such as extreme weather and the COVID-19 pandemic” the report says.

The report which looked at rail data from 2011 to 2022 was requested by Rep. Peter DeFazio D-Ore. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. D-N.J. and Sen.

The surprise new CEO of railroad giant CSX Corp. has roots in the automobile industry.

Joe Hinrichs was a surprise choice to succeed Jim Foote as chief executive officer of CSX Corp. on Sept. 26 for a couple of reasons.

For one Hinrichs was an outsider to Jacksonville-based CSX. Foote had been asked several times in public forums about succession plans since his appointment in late 2017 and he hinted that top executives inside the company would be under consideration.

Second Hinrichs was not only an outsider to the company but also to the railroad industry.

The 55-year-old spent most of his career in the automobile industry including two decades with Ford Motor Co. before he retired as president of its automotive operations in February 2020.

CSX officials believe Hinrichs’ experience in the automotive world will translate well into the railroad industry.

“Joe’s great strength is operational excellence. He enabled Ford to execute world-class manufacturing on a global scale including prioritizing exceptional customer service” Foote said in the news release announcing Hinrichs’ appointment.

“In addition to leading complex businesses over his 30-year career he has proven that he understands how to prioritize safety and efficiency in an industry with dynamics that are similar to those we are navigating today in rail” he said.

CSX began an overhaul of its operations under Foote’s predecessor Hunter Harrison when he took over in March 2017 and swept out the company’s former management.

Hinrichs told the Daily Record in an October interview that he isn’t planning a new strategic direction after the changes implemented by Harrison and Foote.

“The seeds were planted” he said. “Now we’re bringing the water and sun and it’s growing.”

Hinrichs also said he expects to take an active role in community affairs. CSX is one of Jacksonville’s largest and most visible corporations.

“It’s where we’re based it’s where our headquarters is. And I look forward to us being able to show that to the community” he said.

Derived from the 6.7-liter diesel powerplant already featured in the current crop of Ram Heavy Duty trucks the Cummins hydrogen engine promises a comparable performance level while being carbon-free.

While many people believe electric vehicles are the future of the automotive industry others find the current EVs’ performance appalling especially for heavy-duty tasks. The current electric pickup trucks have proven ill-suited for towing which is the main quality of a full-size pickup truck. No matter the badge GMC Rivian or Ford electric pickup trucks lose more than half the range when towing a trailer. This is even more frustrating when you consider that the range was not great to begin with and the fact that charging stations are still few and far between in regions where trucks are dominant.That’s why big carmakers have a more balanced approach when it comes to future-proofing their lineups and battery-electric vehicles are not their only choice. Many still believe that hydrogen hasn’t yet shown its full potential. After fuel cell vehicles internal combustion engines which burn the hydrogen directly could prove a better solution where electric vehicles still struggle to offer meaningful advantages.This is a field that engine giant Cummins pioneered with great results. Cummins has developed hydrogen internal combustion engines for various applications from small trucks to giant ships. Its hydrogen engines are almost identical to their fossil-fuel counterparts except for the engine management unit and the components above the head gasket which are optimized for efficiently burning the hydrogen.The Cummins 6.7-liter ISB (Interact System B) diesel engine is the latest iteration of the B-series engines and is featured across the Ram 2500/3500/4500/5500 Heavy Duty truck lineup. Depending on specifications it can deliver up to 400 horsepower being the workhorse of the Ram HD lineup. The same engine is now available as a hydrogen burner and is known as the Cummins B6.7H. Very few modifications enable the B6.7 to run on hydrogen making the new engine ideal to power future hydrogen versions of the Ram trucks.For its part Stellantis has indicated that it actively considers producing a hydrogen-powered truck. During the Dare Forward 2030 presentation in November Stellantis talked about the company’s hydrogen strategy. The carmaker is already selling hydrogen-powered vans in Europe albeit using fuel cells instead of an internal combustion engine. Nevertheless over the long term Stellantis is considering expanding its hydrogen offering not least with a hydrogen-powered truck in the Ram HD lineup.To be sure Stellantis did not say whether the truck uses a fuel cell or an internal combustion engine. Nevertheless considering that Cummins already makes a hydrogen-powered drop-in replacement for the diesel B6.7 engine it makes sense to offer a truck powered by the B6.7H powerplant. This would provide the advantage of a carbon-free engine while still beating an electric truck regarding range and refueling time. Cummins has already shown a proof-of-concept truck powered by the B6.7H engine. The hydrogen storage system comprises 700-bar pressure high-capacity tanks allowing a 310-mile (around 500-km) range. The engine still delivers 290 horsepower which is pretty similar to the equivalent diesel engine. Cummins used regular diesel driveline components in its prototype which is another advantage over competing zero-emissions solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXR0aW1lcy5jb20vbG9naXN0aWNzL2xlYWRpbmctbG9naXN0aWNzLWZpZ3VyZS1iam9ybi12YW5nLWplbnNlbi1tb3Zlcy1vbi10by1uZXctc3RpbnQtd2l0aC1jdW1taW5zLTEzNDc0NzHSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0dGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9sb2dpc3RpY3MvbGVhZGluZy1sb2dpc3RpY3MtZmlndXJlLWJqb3JuLXZhbmctamVuc2VuLW1vdmVzLW9uLXRvLW5ldy1zdGludC13aXRoLWN1bW1pbnMtMTM0NzQ3MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leading logistics figure Bjorn Vang Jensen moves on to new stint with Cummins,"Bjorn Vang Jensen a former vice president at liner consultancy Sea-Intelligence has recently taken over as the Executive Director of Global Transport at Cummins Inc. where he would be looking after building a global logistics approach focused on the sea air and rail transport.

A leading industry figure in the field of global logistics and supply chain management Jensen was formerly the VP of Advisory Services - Global Supply Chain at Sea-Intelligence. He has also worked with the likes of Maersk and was Head of Global Logistics at Electrolux in the past. Jensen will be helming the air and sea freight verticals in the US industry group.

From the ocean carrier perspective from the 3PL perspective and from the perspective of a manufacturing brand with a global footprint Bjorn has witnessed the rise of globalization and the strides made by the transportation sector for three decades.

Taking to social media regarding the development on Monday Jensen wrote about his new innings and said ""I will soon start in a new role as Executive Director - International Transportation for Cummins Inc. In the beginning of February I will relocate to Dubai. Consulting has provided me with tons of valuable lessons and for those I am indebted to the many clients who had faith in our ability to help them navigate the mess of the last two and a half years. But at heart I am a BCO and I look very much forward to working full-time in that capacity again. I am grateful for the opportunity and I will approach it humbly. Cummins is a terrific 103-year-old company combining cutting-edge products with strong progressive company values and I can't wait to work even closer with all the people I've already met and those I'm about to.""

Cummins Inc. a global power technology company which is headquartered in Columbus Indiana is a corporation of complementary business segments that design manufacture distribute and service a broad portfolio of power solutions.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by March of this year it plans to issue proposed rules and final regulations by the end of 2023 covering heavy-duty trucks through at least the 2030 model year.

With the new rules expected to significantly reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from heavy-duty diesel engines and put in place more stringent GHG standards for certain commercial vehicles manufacturers are already looking ahead.

“There is no one solution or silver bullet when meeting GHG requirements” said Duane Tegels​ product marketing manager–powertrain / VHD VNX VAH at Volvo. “As we transition into new more stringent emissions standards the focus pivots from the engine to the entire powertrain using both torque and horsepower in the right way and time. While reducing unnecessary parasitic losses that also includes aligning shift strategies and selecting proper gearing to meet efficiency goals.”

Chet Ciesielski vice president On-Highway Heavy Duty Truck Business at Navistar said to meet increasingly stringent GHG emissions requirements it is critical to think outside of just the engine itself. That focus for the OEM has been on a modular powertrain solution for the North American market that includes the engine transmission and the aftertreatment system.

“Each component of this powertrain was developed concurrently from the ground up to ensure maximized efficiency between all systems” Ciesielski stated. “The integrated design approach allows each component to do what it does best and deliver achievements in fuel efficiency and a reduction in emissions.”

Puneet Jhawar general manager–Global Spark Ignited Business at Cummins noted that while minimized product changes are needed to be compliant with 2024 GHG regulations with each change engines are cleaner. “By working on technologies and architectures to meet the stringent regulations we can continue delivering the most reliable and efficient products” he said.

“Each of our product development programs spends years testing and validating these designs to deliver on long-term GHG standards” Jhawar added. “Technology has increased our capability for modelling simulating data that helps us be more resourceful in our testing.”

New products and solutions

The International S13 Integrated Powertrain from Navistar is designed with dual-stage SCR as its primary NOx emissions reduction technology. With no EGR cooler on the engine 100 percent of the exhaust flows to the turbocharger during normal operating conditions. That leads to less soot and particulate matter (PM) generation which also supports extending DPF service intervals.

In addition to hardware improvements software in the S13 Integrated Powertrain is designed to optimize operation. For example the engine and transmission communicate on a proprietary CAN network separate from the J1939 public data link. That set up eliminates the possibility of other components on the data link interrupting communications including those that optimize shift strategies.

Volvo’s solution to this challenge is I-Torque a blend of powertrain components including the OEM’s D13 turbo compounding engine 13-speed transmission and ratios ranging from 2.15 to 2.17. To assist the transmission electronic control module with when to shift Volvo uses I-SEE which defines topography before a truck ascends or descends over terrain.

I-See allows the drivetrain to disengage from the engine during descent (when in cruise) increasing the truck’s roll window and therefore its efficiency. It also proactively downshifts before climbing a hill managing the truck’s momentum for a faster and more efficient ascent.

At Cummins the focus on GHG reduction has been on the development of fuel agnostic platforms. The common base architecture incorporates different heads to accommodate multiple fuel types including diesel natural gas and hydrogen.

The first Cummins product in the planned series will be a 15-liter heavy-duty natural gas engine for 2024. The big-bore model which uses low carbon fuel resulting in fuel economy and greenhouse gas improvements will be capable of similar ratings and performance as its diesel counterpart.

“The path to a sustainable future requires continued improvements in existing technology at the same time as we develop new technologies” said Chet Ciesielski at Navistar. “We understand that the transition to zero emissions will not happen overnight and that we must provide customers with increasingly more efficient solutions.”"

But as the need for COVID-19 vaccine filling decreases competition between CDMOs will rise.

Swedish contract development manufacturing organization (CDMO) Recipharm has made various investments across the globe to strengthen its fill-finish capabilities and capacity.

In October the firm scaled up its sterile filling capabilities by investing in Lab+ technology used for low volume blow-fill-seal (BFS) filling at its plant in Kaysersberg France. Furthermore the CDMO signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in July 2021 to invest $500 million to operate a new fill-finish plant which will be located on a 42-hectare site in Morocco. In the same month Recipharm said it would build a fill-finish facility in Uttarakhand India increasing its fill-finish capacity to one billion sterile units per year.

However as life returns to normal and pandemic-related orders for COVID-19 vaccines drop in size – as experienced by the likes of Sartorius Danaher Corporation and Catalent – Recipharm told us that this will lead to an increase in competition between CDMO’s for large-scale projects.

BioProcess Insider (BI): With demand expected to continue throughout 2023 what challenges do you think the fill-finish space will experience?

Recipharm (R): Throughout 2022 we saw CDMO sterile fill & finish capacity grow considerably and in 2023 we predict this trend will continue across the sector. However as demand for COVID-19 vaccine filling slows in the new year we can expect increasing competition among CDMO’s for other large-volume high-throughput aseptic liquid filling projects.

BI: COVID-19 has also highlighted issues with supply chain security is this something else that Recipharm has recognized?

R: 2022 has created a new market environment with significant supply chain constraints high inflation rates and energy insecurity that will last into 2023. In [2023] we expect continued strong demand. CDMO’s will need to carefully manage their growth trajectories and navigate a complex supplier situation in order to continue to support customers effectively.

BI: And what affect do you think this will have on the clients?

R: A shift towards more regional – as opposed to global – supplier relationships is another significant trend we anticipate continuing. Companies are seeking to enhance the robustness and reliability of their supply chains and react to possible moves by some governments – particularly the US and China – to incentivise supply onshoring.

BI: With these factors in mind does Recipharm think there is still a need to invest and expand?

R: There is considerable market demand for sterile capacity in both Europe and Africa and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. With this in mind we intend to continue investing in our capabilities and capacities around liquid aseptic vial filling pre-filled syringes and lyophilisation services across our site network in Italy Germany and France. In Africa we have the flexibility to expand on short timelines pending incoming demand.

BI: What does Recipharm identify as the driver for this sustained demand?

R: A key driver behind this growth in sterile filling demand is the increase in the number of biologics products coming through the development pipeline. Biologics commonly require parenteral administration – as such they require aseptic processing and finishing. As large molecules these biologics also present a challenge when it comes to filtration processes that needs to be addressed at the fill & finish stage.

BI: As a result of extensive pipelines does Recipharm think this will affect forms of fill/finish?

R: Over the next few years we see strong growth in demand for sterile fill & finish – particularly for more complex dosage forms such as pre-filled syringes cartridges and lyophilised products.

Secondly we see more and more pharma companies exploring self-administration for their products for example via auto-injectors soft-mist inhalers or nasal devices. All these devices require fill & finish services – either sterile or non-sterile – as well as capabilities in assembly and packaging. That makes pharma companies’ supply chains more complex but the convenience benefits of self-administered dosage forms add considerable value for patients in need. At Recipharm we are actively working on more integrated services that even include the provision of the devices themselves simplifying the supply chain for customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5ZWxib3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDIvZ29yZG9uLXJ5YW4tZG91YnRmdWwtb2YtbW1hLXJ1bi11cG9uLWFkdmljZS1mcm9tLWpvaG4tZGFuYWhlci1ncmFwcGxpbmctbmV3cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BJJ star Gordon Ryan explains why he's not making MMA move: Danaher has never been wrong,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5ZWxib3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDIvZ29yZG9uLXJ5YW4tZG91YnRmdWwtb2YtbW1hLXJ1bi11cG9uLWFkdmljZS1mcm9tLWpvaG4tZGFuYWhlci1ncmFwcGxpbmctbmV3cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E45185B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Interestingly this wasn't a mistake but rather a policy servers are meant to follow. According to a Q&A Reddit thread posted by a Red Lobster employee the goal is to provide one extra biscuit. ""We bring one biscuit for every person at the table plus an additional biscuit for the table. Corporate policy"" they wrote. To help clarify an employee from Olive Garden which was once owned by the same company shared why Darden restaurants follow the rule. ""We've been told that the first basket with the extra piece is 'a conversation starter' and that's why we do it"" they wrote. It's unclear what conversation they're trying to spark but it could have something to do with the — hopefully friendly — debate over who gets the leftover piece.

Representatives from FAT Brands Inc. the parent company of Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses reached out to announce the original press release provided on this story contained false information.

An alleged JK Polk Investment Group contacted 22News with a press release about Ponderosa Steakhouse reopening. However the owners of Ponderosa FAT Brands Inc. confirmed that there are no active plans to reopen.

It's 2023 and there is a lot for Massachusetts residents to look forward to in the New Year.

If you're lucky enough to live in the western portion of Massachusetts one thing to look forward to in 2023 is welcoming back Ponderosa Steakhouse to two different locations. The cities of both Chicopee and West Springfield will welcome the chain steak house back to the area after the JK Polk Investment Group acquired the rights to the Ponderosa name according to reports from WWLP.

The last Ponderosa Steakhouse in Massachusetts located in Swansea closed its doors in 2009 to the disappointment of many. One of the folks who was most disappointed by this news was James Beaudry Chairman of JK Polk Investment Group which is headquartered in Worcester.

I have always loved Ponderosa and I made it my life’s work to bring it back. People can expect all the menu favorites – and that same Ponderosa feel we all knew and loved. James Beaudry CEO of JK Polk Group

According to reports from WWLP Beaudry and his investment group are planning on opening the Chicopee location first and are hoping to have that happen by summer. No word yet on when the West Springfield location will open its doors to the public. According to the company's website there are currently 16 other Ponderosa Steakhouses located throughout the United States.

Berkshire County residents have missed a true steak house since the closing of Dakota back in April 2013. The Chicopee and West Springfield location is just about an hour's drive from The Berkshires but a good steak is worth it. Would you make the drive?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3BzdC5jb20vbmV3LWJhci1yZXN0YXVyYW50LXRvLW9wZW4taW4tdmlsbGFnZS1vZi1uZXd0b3duLXBhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Bar & Restaurant to Open in Village of Newtown PA,"The second location of Warrington restaurant Ardana Food & Drink will be opening in Newtown PA.

I noticed the Coming Soon sign and construction when I took my daughter to the Village of Newtown shopping center over the weekend.

We were headed to the lululemon pop up (along with every other teenager in the area) and couldn't help but notice the project underway a few spaces down where Solstice used to be.

Chris Rollins Chris Rollins loading...

I went closer to investigate and saw the name. I've never heard of it before so searched it on social media and it looks great.

The restaurant's Facebook page says it's Mediterranean meza style dining and followers are thrilled that their favorite place is expanding.

You can check out the menu here. It's a restaurant/bar serving wood-fired pizza pasta pita sandwiches platters desserts (like Baklava...yum) and more. You will also enjoy cocktails draft beer and wine.

The sign informing the public that the liquor license has been applied for with the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is hanging in the front window.

Chris Rollins Chris Rollins loading...

I took a peek inside the window and here's what I saw. Progress. It's looking good. The barstools look really comfortable don't they?

Chris Rollins Chris Rollins loading...

The restaurant's website reveals the meaning behind the name of the eatery. Ardana is a small village in Cyprus where the owners brothers Mike and Antoni Christou's grandmother was raised. Their goal is to bring the flavors of the Mediterranean to their restaurants.

It's due to open in late Winter. I'll let you know when I find out the exact opening date.

I'm anxious to stop in and try it.

In the meantime you can visit Ardana in Warrington at 751 Easton Road.

Future of Food No matter what separates us we all have at least one thing in common — we all eat.

Agweek and our partners at Forum Communications Company are thinking about the Future of Food. This reporting series looks at the techniques and technologies that are advancing agriculture and the science around our foods and food production.









Above the traditional Corn Belt John Deere scientists and engineers in Fargo are at the forefront of the company’s ambitious “electrification” strategies. Some 700 people work among four buildings several blocks apart. It’s called the ""Intelligent Solutions Group.”

The company has its Power Electric Systems (PES) building and a few blocks away a “main plant” a “logistics” building and a “new product introduction” building (the one prominently seen from the Fargodome in North Dakota State University’s Research Park).

Why Fargo?

In the 1990s John Deere was a customer of the former Phoenix International. Phoenix was created in 1987 by former employees from Fargo-based Steiger Tractor Co. Steiger filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986. Later that year Steiger was swallowed by Tenneco/Case-IH (now CNH Industrial).

Led by visionaries including Barry Batcheller Phoenix made electronics — farm tractor hitch controls and dashboard electronics. John Deere fully acquired Phoenix in 1999 but continued the Phoenix name until about 2014.

John Deere’s Power Electronic Systems Building is brimming with activity Dec. 6 2022 in Fargo North Dakota. The space includes a “flexible” final assembly line where employees put together a variety of products including motor drives. They might include circuit board assemblies made in another John Deere building in town and their components may go into kits assembled at yet another building. Mikkel Pates / Agweek

The Fargo employees specialize in electronics-related products — especially power “electrification” products.

This “electrification” is part of John Deere’s big “Leap Ambitions” announced early in 2022.

Among its goals: By 2030 they expect to help their farmer-clients do many things — improve nitrogen efficiency by 20% increase crop protection efficiency by 20% and reduce customer carbon dioxide emissions by 15%.

‘Leap Ambition’

Kent Wanner a senior staff electrification application design engineer the latest of five prestigious “Fellow” recipients recently gave Agweek a tour of John Deere’s PES Building.

John Deere has 75000 employees. It has 30 “fellows” recognized for their excellence and five of them who work in Fargo North Dakota gathered there on Dec. 6 2022. They are (from left): Noel Anderson (2019) Long Wu (2018) Kent Wanner (2022) Brij Singh (2020) and Will Cooper (2021). Mikkel Pates / Agweek

It is the “design center” for electrification products for all of John Deere nationally (and globally). He is one of the elite “fellows” and received this designation in 2022.

The PES building was constructed in 2012 for $22 million and includes 90000 square-feet of work space.

Wanner explained that engineers of all descriptions work here — software hardware mechanical and manufacturing engineers. These minds work on equipment solutions that may be — will be — commercialized. But they can’t be talked about — yet.

The ideas for inventions come from everywhere — customers and dealers to name a few. Engineers turn them into engine controllers transmission controllers displays GPS receivers sensors wireless communications telematic devices and more. Often they can reuse components and ideas from previous components and applications. All of these products and technologies are considered part of John Deere’s “Technology Stack” available for use on one or more machines.

Before a new idea is made into something physical engineers and technicians test them virtually. Long Wu with a doctorate in electrical engineering/power electronics leads a group that vets the design before it becomes a physical prototype. Some of the products start by studying Deere’s hardware embedded software connectivity data platforms and applications from previous products.

Once passing the virtual test the component is built along with a movable “tester” — large black metal cabinets that move about the building where the product undergoes a gauntlet of tests.

The employees then subject them to every kind of trauma. They fix them to large shaking tables simulating effects of running on tracks or wheels.

They put them in a saltwater fog. They dunk them one meter in saltwater.

They use high-power sprays.

They expose them to short-circuits improper jump-starting reverse polarity. They simulate the effects of driving under a high-voltage power line.

They see how the components behave at temperature extremes — minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit to plus 185.

The lab is equipped with two “anechoic” (free from echo) chambers — large metal rooms within the larger lab with special metal exterior and welds and seams ensuring no electromagnetic waves can get in or out. They hit the products with electromagnetic waves over a wide range of frequencies.

“We don’t want to emit too much energy to corrupt wireless communications or to be susceptible to external electromagnetic energy” either Wanner said.

Engineer Kent Wanner of John Deere says engineers and technicians make sure products are rugged. In this “anechoic” (free from echo) chamber they guarantee proper electronics product operation while being bombarded with electromagnetic waves and also make sure the products don’t emit waves that could corrupt nearby communications radios or other equipment.

Once the products get the go-ahead they are built at a “main plant” a few blocks away. Some go into assembly kits and are shipped elsewhere.

Once products are tested the “product testers” (cabinets) are kept as long as the product is in service in case it needs to be “requalified” or requires a design change in its life cycle.

Finished assembled parts can go to a “logistics building” where other fellow employees put them in “install kits.”

Besides using electronics in its own products Deere sells them to non-competing non-ag companies that use “electrification” (ie. hybrid or battery electric trucks buses). Some companies will test their own vehicle controllers in the Fargo lab.

Futuristic but real

Deere’s inventions in Fargo seem futuristic but some are already in the marketplace. ""This is real"" Wanner said.

One of the best examples is a pair of “hybrid” four-wheel-drive construction loaders released in 2013 and 2015. Hybrid means they use two sources of energy — diesel fuel and “kinetic” energy or energy created from moving the vehicle back into useful work. They do this by tying electric motors and generators into the drive train.

“Imagine there’s a motor driving the transmission” Wanner said. “When we want to slow down and lift a bucket that’s full and dump it into a crusher or truck that slowing down normally gets burned up in the brakes as heat. With this electrified drive train we can use the motor to slow us down and act as a generator — creating energy that can be effectively used to spin the hydraulic pump or an engine cooling fan. Electrification of the drive train on large machinery has been shown to cut fuel use by 25% or more.""

The principles go beyond “traction” vehicles.

Fargo engineers were instrumental in creating the ExactEmerge planter system — one of the company’s most successful models. Released in 2014 ExactEmerge uses “electrification” to control planting at high speeds. This puts two electric motors and controllers per row of a planter.

“One of them meters out the number of seeds per second that you want to put in that row” Wanner said. “The other matches the speed of that row as it travels down the field. With electrification we now let the second motor match the ground speed and in fact accelerates the seed in the opposite direction that the planter is going. So if you’re going 5 mph and it accelerate the seed at minus 5 mph … the seed just drops and it doesn’t roll.""

So instead of planting at 5 mph the farmer can plant at 10 mph with exactitude. This gets twice as many acres planted. The concept has special benefits when a 48-row wide planter turns a corner: The outside goes faster than the inside row.

“The electronics can now have different rows matching the speed still maintaining very good spacing” Wanner said.

Among the tests for products at John Deere are power-washing and water immersion vats.

What’s ahead?

Some principles will have a role in improving “autonomy” in machines.

Oh yes and their scientists are developing machines that can study and interpret “fluorescence” emitted from growing plants genetically designed for the purpose of emitting data about crop stress. The fluorescence is invisible to the naked eye but visible from high altitude and space.

Electrification won’t eliminate diesel any time soon Wanner said but it often allows the machine to use a much smaller diesel engine than otherwise necessary saving fuel and money.

The customer benefit is lower fuel use — a big issue at times of high fuel prices.

Wanner said that eventually the cost of electrification should come down creating new value and enabling more applications for farmers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy91cmJhbmFjaXRpemVuL25hbWUvbm9yYS1kZWVyZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODUyNzg0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nora Deere Obituary (2023) - Urbana OH - Urbana Daily Citizen,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/urbanacitizen/name/nora-deere-obituary?id=38527842 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy91cmJhbmFjaXRpemVuL25hbWUvbm9yYS1kZWVyZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODUyNzg0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3RveXMvdHJhY3Rvci10b3lzL9IBKGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3RveXMvdHJhY3Rvci10b3lzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21 Best Tractor Toys: Your Ultimate List (2023),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='heavy.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /toys/tractor-toys/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2B6F1F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3RveXMvdHJhY3Rvci10b3lzL9IBKGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3RveXMvdHJhY3Rvci10b3lzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

For the second year in a row Delta earned Cirium’s Platinum Award for global operational excellence. The award reflects Delta’s operational complexity and the exemplary work of Delta people to achieve on-time performance while limiting the impact of disruption to its customers.

Delta was the most on-time North American airline in 2022. Of Delta’s 1004684 flights last year tracked by Cirium 83.63% arrived on time Cirium reported.

""The care and commitment of Delta people across our diverse global operation helped secure this recognition again as the industry leader"" said John Laughter EVP and Chief of Operations. ""We ran the most on-time airline during a challenging year of rebuilding and made improvements that will allow us to climb even higher this year.""

Delta has consistently placed a focus on providing on-time performance a foundational expectation of its customers. The mantra: “safe clean and on time with bags” is common refrain throughout Delta’s operation – unifying all its people behind a common objective.

“Congratulations to Delta Air Lines for their excellent performance in Cirium’s 2022 On-Time Performance Review getting its passengers to their destinations on time as the sector revived during 2022” said Cirium CEO Jeremy Bowen.

Delta’s on-time performance far exceeded North American industry benchmarks. Of the more than 5 million flights tracked by Cirium in 2022 71.91% arrived on time. Cirium defines an on-time flight as one that arrives within 15 minutes of its scheduled gate arrival.

Delta’s on-time arrival percentage was 3.17% higher than its nearest North American competitor.

However they didn’t fulfill their promise and canceled the original flight.

Delta Airline’s flight scheduled to fly from Oakland to Salt Lake City on Christmas day was overbooked resulting in the airline offering an $8000 voucher to passengers to give up their seats. David Reeves traveling with his family of three volunteered for the voucher but never got the money.

Overbooking and the Resultant Offer to Give Up Seats

Airlines in the US routinely overbook flights – selling more tickets than seats onboard. Overbooking is often the result of airlines trying to squeeze out every possible penny from passengers who often get the short end of the stick. When an overbooking occurs airlines must move passengers to other flights and by US law offer compensation to impacted passengers.

David Reeve and his family’s experience is akin to the scenario above. He and his family were going to Nashville on a flight to Salt Lake City. Passengers were offered $8000 to give up their seats and fly on a later flight at the gate. The family agreed to give up three seats which qualified them for a $24000 voucher as compensation. However the family never received their money because the first officer for the flight did not show up; hence the flight was canceled as a result.

According to ABC7 Reeves had asked the gate agent if the airline would honor the voucher offer. According to him;

“So I asked her you are not honoring the vouchers you agreed to pay and now you’re canceling the flight?”

He added that the decision not to honor the vouchers was bad business.

“That’s not right; if we are not getting the flight and you offered the voucher why don’t we get the voucher?

As if not honoring the voucher was not bad enough the flight was canceled and Reeves and his family were offered another flight two days later.

The airline compensation policies went into effect as the cancellation was “considered” controllable by the Department of Transportation’s standard.

According to Reeves Delta Airlines should have honored everything it promised to pay. The family rented a car drove to Monterey Regional Airport and booked a flight on another airline. However according to Reeves’s family Delta Airlines did pay for a hotel and the rented car but has yet to refund the flight to Nashville.

DVN,Devon Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL3dpbGwtZGV2b24tZW5lcmd5cy11bHRyYS1oaWdoLXlpZWxkaW5nLWRpdmlkZW5kLXN1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Devon Energy's Ultra-High-Yielding Dividend Survive in 2023?,"The company's oil-fueled dividend is at risk if crude prices continue cooling off.

Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) paid a gusher of dividends in 2022. Fueled by its innovative fixed-plus-variable dividend framework the oil company paid investors $5.17 per share in 2022. With the stock recently trading at around $60 per share Devon's dividend yield is 8.5%. That's several times above the S&P 500's 1.7%.

However Devon's dividend payments rise and fall with oil prices. With crude prices cooling off in recent months the company's most recent dividend was below its peak. Here's a look at what dividend investors should expect from the oil company in 2023.

Drilling down into Devon Energy's dividend

Devon Energy's dividend policy means it makes a fixed base payment each quarter that it can sustain at lower oil prices. The company increased that floor by about 13% following its RimRock Oil & Gas acquisition in the middle of 2022. In addition the company pays a variable dividend of up to 50% of its excess free cash flow each quarter after accounting for the base dividend.

With oil and gas prices rising in 2022 Devon's cash flow surged enabling it to pay significant variable dividends each quarter:

However the variable payment declined last quarter due to lower oil prices. Devon realized an average of $95.80 per barrel sold during the second quarter enabling it to produce $2.1 billion of free cash flow -- the highest in its history -- and to pay a record variable dividend in the third quarter. However with oil prices cooling off in that subsequent period (Devon realized an average of $84.38 per barrel) Devon's free cash flow declined to $1.5 billion. As a result it paid a lower variable dividend in the fourth quarter.

What's ahead for Devon's dividend?

Oil prices continued to decline during the fourth quarter and were recently below $80 per barrel. That will put downward pressure on the company's cash flow in that period which will likely affect its next dividend payment.

However on a more positive note the company should benefit from the acquisitions of RimRock and Validus Energy which both closed in the third quarter. Those assets should generate significant free cash flow for the company. Devon had projected that those deals would boost its cash flow by 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 assuming oil averaged $90 a barrel. While that price point didn't happen the acquisitions should help offset some of the impact of lower oil prices in the period. That's why Devon boosted its base dividend following the RimRock deal and expected the Validus transaction would increase its variable dividend outlook by 10%.

Even though oil prices declined during the second half of 2022 most analysts expect a reversal in 2023. Several Wall Street banks set oil price targets at more than $90 a barrel in 2023.

Analysts pointed out several catalysts that should fuel higher oil prices over the next year. On the supply side they noted that the U.S. government wouldn't be releasing supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Meanwhile oil companies continue to hold back investment spending due to continued uncertainty. On top of that there are still a lot of unknowns about Russian crude due to the continued fallout from its invasion of Ukraine.

While there are demand concerns because the global economy may slow in 2023 there are also consumption catalysts. China has shifted its pandemic policy which could drive a significant uptick in oil demand from that country. In addition there's a growing return to normalcy in other countries including more people returning to the office in the U.S. and increased business travel. Add in lower prices at the pump and gasoline demand could remain resilient even if there is a recession this year.

Another gusher of dividends seems likely

That combination of acquisition-fueled growth and the prospect of higher oil prices in 2023 bodes well for Devon's dividend. While the company might not exceed 2022's payout of more than $5 per share it could come close especially if oil prices reach the $90-to-$100 range by midyear as most analysts anticipate. Because of that Devon remains an attractive option for investors seeking a high-octane divided fueled by oil prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRlbmVyZ3kuY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZXMvdGhlcmUtYW5kLWJhY2stYWdhaW4tcmljay1tdW5jcmllZi1hbmQtZGV2b24tZW5lcmd5cy1wZXJtaWFuLWpvdXJuZXktMjAzNTc50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There and Back Again: Rick Muncrief and Devon Energy's Permian Journey,"A child of the Permian Basin Rick Muncrief long knew the potential of the basin’s now-booming western lobe.

Muncrief methodically but rapidly built up WPX Energy Inc. through West Texas and New Mexico’s liquids-rich Delaware Basin after he took over in 2014. Now he remains focused on the Delaware as the jewel of a multibasin portfolio after WPX combined with Oklahoma City rival Devon Energy Corp. in a $5.75 billion so-called merger of equals.

""It’s driven by the geology and the amount of raw resources in the Delaware” Muncrief told Hart Energy. “The Permian is a place we’re very very comfortable with and very very proud of.""

Muncrief promotes a bold and decisive acquisition approach while still holding dear to strategic and conservative fiscal values. He positioned WPX in the Delaware—while divesting in gassy noncore areas—and is now further diversifying the merged Devon Energy he took over in the Williston and Eagle Ford shale plays through the recent acquisitions of RimRock Oil & Gas and Validus Energy respectively.

That intrepid attitude proved imperative in 2020 when Devon and WPX took action in an industry that initially halted all dealmaking during the pandemic.

“During the pandemic we felt like everyone was on their back heels. They were afraid to make a move” Muncrief said. “At Devon and WPX we felt like there were things that each of us needed. For WPX we needed a little more scale and inventory. Devon was concerned about a lot of exposure to federal lands. At WPX we didn’t have as much. That’s where it was truly a win-win.”

“The Permian is a place we’re very very comfortable with and very very proud of.” - Rick Muncrief Devon Energy

Now the combined Devon estimates its fourth-quarter production at about 650000 boe/d with roughly 65% of the volumes hailing from the Delaware. But the barrels were well more than 70% weighted toward the Delaware before the recent RimRock and Validus deals.

Gabriele Sorbara managing director of equity research at Siebert Williams Shank & Co. said acquisitions are not the red flags for investors that they were just before and during the pandemic. Companies need to build drilling inventory and they should if they have strong free cash flow like Devon.

“M&A isn’t the risk it used to be. M&A is good if you’ve got the cash and you can get the deal done” Sorbara said. “If there’s an opportunity Devon is taking it. It’s really important to have scale and use that cash in a productive way. We’re going to continue to see consolidation across the basins.”

Permian birthright

Born in Ardmore Okla. Muncrief moved to Odessa Texas in 1958—before he was old enough to remember—after his father started working in the Permian for El Paso Natural Gas.

They would later live in the Delaware Basin in Hobbs and Jal N.M.

At the time U.S. oil production remained on a steady rise. But at a domestic total of 7.1 MMbbl/d in 1957 the Permian still did not come near today’s record high of 5.5 MMbbl/d which is 45% of the nation’s daily production.

“It’s been a foundational basin for the U.S. energy picture” Muncrief said of the Permian.

And he is thrilled his father is still alive to see the growth today.

“He can’t believe the size of the facilities being built and the amount of gas and crude oil coming out of the Permian. The activity levels and efficiencies are what you really point to” Muncrief said. “I took him out to a field three or four years ago and he was just amazed. There’s a lot of the same country but just a lot more activity.”

Stationed at Devon’s headquarters in Oklahoma City today Muncrief left the Permian to graduate from high school in Oklahoma and to attend Oklahoma State University where he naturally majored in petroleum engineering technology.

Among other stops Muncrief loosely followed his father’s legacy working his way up at El Paso its acquirer Burlington and then ConocoPhillips Co. which ultimately swallowed up Burlington. In 2009 he eventually took over as senior vice president of operations and resource development at Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources Inc.

And then his big break came in 2014 when a struggling WPX Energy appointed him CEO.

Aiming for the Delaware

WPX spun off from midstream operator Williams Cos. at the end of 2011 so it could concentrate on exploration and production.

The company promptly struggled with a lack of crude oil exposure and challenging natural gas prices.

At the time WPX’s gas-weighted portfolio was only 20% liquids. Muncrief was hired to transform the company.

“We were in seven different basins at that time. The Permian was not one of those” Muncrief said dryly.

In mid-2015 after oil prices had plunged WPX made its first move to buy privately held RKI Exploration & Production for $2.35 billion because of its 92000 acres in the Delaware in Texas’ Loving County and New Mexico’s Eddy County.

“At that point in time the Delaware was really struggling. It was much more of a challenging area to drill and operate in than say the Midland side of the Permian” Muncrief said. “I think for us we went to the geology. That’s the thing that really took us to the Delaware Basin. There was a fair amount of development going on but we felt there were at least another two or three levels of efficiencies and capabilities that we would see in the Delaware.”

Five years later it turned out that the RKI deal made the Devon merger more practical. Much of RKI’s acreage bordered Devon’s position.

“That’s why ultimately down the road the merger made so much sense with the adjacency to the two companies’ acreage positions” Muncrief said.

But Muncrief and WPX did not stop there.

In a recovering but still-struggling industry in early 2017 WPX scooped up the Delaware assets of Panther Energy and Carrier Energy.

Then in late 2019 just prior to the pandemic WPX paid $2.5 billion to buy out privately held Felix Energy and its large Delaware position.

Eventually WPX’s seven basins—without a Permian footprint—turned into two with a big Delaware position and a solid Williston play.

As WPX was growing in the Delaware Neal Dingmann Truist Securities energy analyst said Muncrief was able to successfully pivot WPX to become a leader in shareholder returns at a time when investors were finally forcing producers to practice discipline.

“He’s a very disciplined CEO” Dingmann said. “The top leaders are great operators and they understand Wall Street—that’s a tough combination. Rick kind of checks all those boxes.”

Devon was not as analytical with its strategies before Muncrief took over sometimes following the trends set by its peers.

And in the years that WPX was growing in the Delaware Devon was mostly focused on divesting with some big buys mixed in between sales.

In Devon’s world

After making a big expensive buy in the Eagle Ford Shale i n 2013 amid high crude prices Devon largely focused on asset sales with some notable exceptions.

In 2014 Devon sold its noncore portfolio to now-defunct Linn Energy and used the proceeds to buy Oklahoma STACK acreage from Felix.

Then over three years Devon sold its Canadian upstream and midstream assets and its noncore Midland Basin acreage.

In 2020 and shortly before the WPX deal Devon sold its shale pioneering Barnett Shale gas assets to BKV Corp. which is now planning to go public under the strength of those gassy acres and natural gas prices.

Muncrief joked that he asked the Devon team why they made the Barnett deal before he took over. But then he responded seriously.

“I’ve asked myself that same thing of some of the things WPX sold. But here’s the thing” he said. “Those assets were sold at an attractive price but more importantly got you focused on and gave you cash to operate on some of your higher-margin and more profitable areas like the Delaware. There’s no regrets. You make those calls and take the proceeds and move on and reinvest them.”

Now apart from the Delaware Devon is positioned in the Anadarko Basin the Williston the Eagle Ford and the Powder River Basin. Those positions include newly acquired acreage from RimRock for $865 million cash in July and from Validus for $1.8 billion in cash in September.

“A multibasin multicommodity business is the one that’s going to be successful over the long haul” Muncrief said. “We all recognize the strength of our Delaware position but there’s also opportunities in other basins especially when you’re in the core of these basins like we are.”

And as long as prices and free cash flows remain healthy Devon will continue to eye potential growth moves. “We’ve always had a high bar” he said. “We’ve been real disciplined in our moves and I don’t think that’s going to change.”

Those types of bolt-on deals like RimRock and Validus in non-Delaware basins are critical for future growth said David Harris Devon’s executive vice president and chief corporate development officer in an interview with Hart Energy. He noted that both deals bring oil-weighted acreage positions close to Devon’s existing footprints.

“Scale matters as we’ve moved into this new era of unconventional development and we believe having really high-quality low-breakeven assets in the premiere basins around the country is an important part of that” Harris said. “We think being able to evaluate opportunities and places outside the Permian has given us the opportunity to find some unique value creation for our shareholders.”

Gabriele Sorbara said the Wall Street focus on single-basin companies is not as strong as before especially since it is so hard to still buy into the heart of the Permian.

“I think we’re in a different world today. Back in the day people wanted that pure-play focus. But I think multibasin is an advantage in this day and age” Sorbara said. “I think about who’s got the ability to sustain and thrive longer term. Devon is there.”

Forward financial focus

Muncrief took over as CEO of the combined Devon in early 2021 and quickly made waves in early May by announcing a pioneering dividend strategy—a fixed-plus-variable dividend—that was quickly followed by others making similar moves such as Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and ConocoPhillips.

The idea was to reward shareholders with a predictable fixed dividend and return more to investors on a quarterly basis when commodities prices are stronger—as has been the case through most of 2022.

“One of the things we heard from investors for a number of years is what do you do with those cash flows when they’re real strong” Muncrief said. “We had a history of putting it to work at the drill bit. We saw an opportunity to change that model. That’s where Devon landed with the ability to pay a really nice fixed dividend and the stronger cash flows allow for the variable dividend returning a substantial portion back to shareholders.”

When oil prices dipped in the fall so did the third-quarter dividend—albeit predictably. But analysts and investors also saw rising capital spending which is largely from inflation on services and lower-than-expected production guidance. So the stock price fell a bit in November from recent highs.

“We’ve been real disciplined in our moves and I don’t think that’s going to change.” - Rick Muncrief Devon Energy

But the longer-term optimism remains strong Sorbara said. “The guidance was a bit lower than expected and it raised some flags with investors. But Rick is a great leader. The assets are top notch. The whole industry has evolved and they’re pioneers. At some point the industry will pivot toward growth and Devon is perfectly situated.”

Looking forward Muncrief sees a company with strong productivity free cash flow and shareholder returns. But the overall industry challenges of inflation and well productivity will remain. He sees production volumes relatively flat in 2023 with some modest upside while running close to 25 rigs.

“I think we’re doing a good job of fighting the impacts of inflation. You’re still going to see those capital numbers go up across the board” he said. “I think we just need to stick to our guns. I think everyone is going to try to keep their volumes flat.”

Inflation is pushing the cost of wells up but Devon is saving time and money through efficiencies by cutting down on the amount of days to drill and complete wells. “You’re saving 10% on time by doing it more quickly and efficiently” he said. “We’ll see how it all plays out.”

Well productivity degradation is a real issue across the industry with companies drilling their best opportunities first he said but improving efficiencies and new exploration will help offset the weaknesses. That is the booming market scenario for the services sector with flat production requiring more activity he said.

But do not confuse that realism for a lack of optimism. There is a reason Devon is only hedging 20% to 30% on crude production and even less on natural gas he said. The global supply-and-demand outlook remains in Devon’s favor for some time he said. And that brings him back to his emphasis on discipline.

“We just need to be disciplined and patient and keep the market supplied” Muncrief said. “We do think there’s a supply tightness on the horizon. The U.S. SPR [Strategic Petroleum Reserve[ releases are just about over and we don’t even have China really reopened yet. So we see bullish indicators.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vMTU5LjIwMy4xNDQuOTgvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9teS8yMDIzLzAxLzIwMjItcmVjYXAtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJldGlyZW1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Recap: Executive Retirements,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='159.203.144.98', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business-economy/2023/01/2022-recap-executive-retirements/ (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError(""hostname '159.203.144.98' doesn't match either of 'dmagazine.com', 'www.dmagazine.com'""))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vMTU5LjIwMy4xNDQuOTgvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9teS8yMDIzLzAxLzIwMjItcmVjYXAtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJldGlyZW1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY3RleGFtaW5lci5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9lbmVyZ3ktZmlzaC1hbmQtZmFtaWx5LXBhdWwtZm9ybWljYS10YWtlcy1hLWJvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Energy Fish and Family: Paul Formica Takes a Bow,"Before retiring from his seat in the legislature State Sen.

We live in interesting times! This (almost) post-pandemic era is just now allowing the unfolding of new technology that was being worked on but not introduced to the industry while much of the world was in lock-down. Get ready to hear about some of the latest and greatest new developments that will help advance healthcare for all in 2023!

The COVID-19 virus and resultant worldwide pandemic hit the citizenry of the world severely! Millions died and 10-times that number became sick with the virus. I have been impressed by how rapidly the biotech industry was able to come up with diagnostic tests to detect the virus in patients and how quickly the bio-pharmaceutical industry was able to develop vaccines. In both cases the medical plastics industry served to help make personal protective equipment test swabs kits and ultimately the vaccines that helped bring resistance to the virus. As the threat of severe viral effects are reduced and mostly eliminated the diagnostics bio-pharma and medical device communities are now able to focus on other areas of need.

Advances in diagnostics

In diagnostics we see products such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) that help diabetic patients more closely monitor and control their blood-glucose levels and avoid the complications that come with frequent extreme high and low glucose levels. See Dexcom’s G7 and Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre. The latest CGMs almost completely eliminate the need for frequent needle-sticks to test blood-glucose levels. Soon to be developed and introduced are systems that will act together to automatically administer insulin-type medication when high blood-glucose levels are detected. New technologies in transdermal sensors skin adhesives and electronics that enable the monitoring all work together to make these CGMs a reality. Also in development are implantable systems such as TheraCyte which support living cells implanted into patients that will generate the needed insulin and be self-regulating leading to needle-free treatment!

Next-gen continuous glucose monitors such as Dexcom's G7 bring tangible quality-of-life improvements to patients.

The bio-pharmaceutical industry has benefitted from single-use systems (SUS) in the development of new vaccine drugs and once developed in the production of large-volume batches of the novel vaccines. SUS have reduced development time and the cost of new drug research. And when the new drug moves into production better control and lower costs help speed up production enabling distribution of the medicines throughout the world. SUS suppliers such as ThermoFisher and Qosina have resources available to those needing selection recommendations.

Connected textiles

In much the same way medical textiles are being developed and refined that have built-in sensor technology antimicrobial features signal detection and the ability to monitor health signals on a continuous basis. These textiles will be linked to connected devices to communicate directly with the healthcare providers not only to monitor but also treat the patient as needed. The early treatment of a health condition will help prevent its escalation into a severe condition such as a heart attack or stroke.

Novel polymers are being developed that can deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or medication directly to the patient as needed often over extended time periods. Leistritz twin-screw compounding systems are being used by manufacturers to incorporate APIs into polymer systems.

In addition to APIs novel drug-delivery systems are offering new ways to deliver medication to babies toddlers active youth and middle- and advanced-age family members. Medication compliance is becoming easier to control and is having a beneficial impact on patient health.

The orthopedics industry has continually been improving the surface characteristics and properties of implant devices to give patients faster healing reduced pain and to ensure the long-term success of the devices. Antimicrobials have been used and now together with very effective bone-growth promoters are giving the implants long-term survivability properties. Furthermore the polymers of construction are giving the implants better functionality and improving their long-term use preventing replacement procedures.

More-durable materials

Polymer manufacturers are continuing to improve their resins to bring better properties to target end-products. For instrument housings and medical durables the materials of construction must be regularly cleaned and sanitized often through exposure to aggressive cleaners and solvents. If not properly designed the products and the materials from which they are made will deteriorate well before the end of their useful life. A manufacturer recently developed a nylon that can survive more than 500 autoclave cycles without clarity deterioration. EMS-Grivory America will describe the new material during a presentation at the Medical Design & Manufacturing (MD&M) West MiniTec event in Anaheim CA the week of Feb. 6 2023. (The two-day MiniTec conference sponsored by SPE is scheduled for Feb. 6 and 7. MD&M West which is co-located with Plastec West and three other events runs from Feb. 7 to 9.)

Made of EMS Grilamid TR HT 200 developed at the EMS-Grivory R&D Center in Switzerland this 2-mm plaque has undergone 500 cycles of autoclaving at 134°C.

Similarly a recently formed industry consortium will help establish common goals for performance testing and qualification of durable materials of construction used in healthcare environments. By having a unified voice developers can strive for common characteristics and improve performance while reducing cost of development for all. This industry-led effort called HSI (HealthCare Surfaces Institute) is working to develop test standards that could allow OEMs to make and test their products before they enter the marketplace to determine their suitability for use.

Additive manufacturing makes its mark

Processing in 2023 will continue to support improved production and novel products. The rapid advancement of additive manufacturing (AM) systems has pushed industry to re-think how low-volume products should be made. AM parts have improved properties excellent appearance and can incorporate multiple materials. Changing from one size or feature to another is quick and low cost allowing on-the-fly improvements of even production parts.

Micro-manufacturing capabilities are also expanding the frontiers of small part production with amazing functionality. Micro-produced parts are supporting the sophisticated diagnostics mentioned earlier allowing better testing with minimal blood saliva or other samples. The smaller parts reduce manufacturing costs give faster results and help improve healthcare where used.

Harmonization finally within reach?

Material qualification almost uniformly relies on ISO test standards. This “harmonization” was recently seen when Swiss authorities introduced a measure that would allow products reviewed and cleared for use by US FDA to be cleared for use in their country. The adoption of the recently enacted Medical Device Regulation (MDR) has severely limited what is available for their citizenry. If Swiss legislators give full approval to the proposal many products not currently available for use if approved by FDA could then be used in Switzerland.

I have long urged the harmonization of testing and regulations for medical devices by regulatory bodies of various governments. This proposal by Switzerland if adopted could be a model for other countries around the world.

Circularity and the single-use device

Finally as the world and the medtech community adjust to understanding that end-of-life issues for plastic products must be addressed by OEMs as well as product users I believe that there is much to be done. To date very little is being done to address the issue of what to do with single-use devices (SUDs) after their use. Virtually every medtech company has adopted the policy that no regrind is to be used in their products. This is to ensure that the materials of construction consistently meet all the required physical chemical and biological requirements which are reviewed by FDA prior to market clearance for a product.

More needs to be done to address the issue of single-use medical devices in the waste stream.

If systems can be developed to sort decontaminate and clean the SUDs after use this waste stream can become part of the raw materials that go into the next batch of new products being made. Testing of course will need to be done to confirm suitability for use.

I believe that moving toward this goal of using more feedstock from used SUDs will require the cooperation of both FDA and medical device OEMs and the establishment of support structures not yet in place such as collection systems sorters cleaners and processors that can prepare the once-used medical devices to become feedstock for new products. For those that say it can’t be done I say look to the beverage bottle industry and check out the way PET bottles are reclaimed ground cleaned and pelletized making that material available for production of new PET beverage bottles. FDA has cleared these reprocessed materials for use in new beverage bottles. So if it's acceptable for the beverage industry we in the medical device industry should be able to qualify appropriately sorted and selected materials for reprocessing in medical devices.

In summary I look forward to significant change in 2023 as new materials processes products and procedures are introduced. The last three years of growth have generally been kept in the labs and manufacturing plants but are now ready for introduction to the user community. I urge everyone who can justify it to get out and attend trade shows conferences and expositions. Nothing beats face-to-face engagement and witnessing first-hand the latest and greatest new offerings. My favorite is Medical Design & Manufacturing (MD&M) West in Anaheim CA the week of Feb. 7 to 9 2023. I will be there and I hope to see you there as well!

Unveiled in a research report released Tuesday before the bell the list - which is updated quarterly - is comprised of “high-conviction long-term” investing picks seen to have significant upside potential.”

Last year the firm’s selections delivered a total return in local currency of negative 10.4 per cent outperforming the MSCI World Index (negative 18.4 per cent). Since its 2019 inception the list has had a total positive return of 23.2 per cent topping the benchmark at 15.6 per cent.

Broadly RBC strategists are expecting a flattish or positive low single digit 12-month return in the S&P 500 as investors contend with deeply bearish sentiment (a contrarian/bullish signal) and ongoing concerns about the outlook for the economy the Fed geopolitics and corporate earnings. It recommends holding overweight positions in the Energy Financials Health Care Technology and Utilities sectors over the next six to 12 months.

“With the changes to the Top 30 list this quarter we switch into best ideas that we also view as offering more attractive positioning in the current environment” it said.

The lone Canadian company to be added to the list is Constellation Software Inc. (CSU-T).

“We add Constellation Software with our outlook for high shareholder returns reflecting Constellation’s ability to rapidly compound capital through acquisitions potential to benefit from an uncertain macro environment (high mix of recurring revenue and greater likelihood of M&A) and attractive valuation in our view” said analyst Paul Treiber who has an “outperform” recommendation and $2600 target for its shares (versus the $2472.61 average on the Street).

Returning Canadian companies are:

* Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (ATD-T) with an “outperform” rating and $80 target. The average target on the Street is $69.92.

Analyst Irene Nattel: “Despite challenging macro backdrop multiple avenues for growth underpinned by: 1) top-line momentum from a more-focused data-driven approach to merchandising/promotional strategies; 2) well-defined initiatives and strategies to optimize procurement; 3) focus on localized merchandise pricing promotions and assortments; 4) innovative fuel initiatives including rollout of Circle-K gas; 5) cost optimization; 6) network development; and 7) opportunistic acquisitions. On track to exceed F23 EBITDA objective of $5.1B excluding merger and acquisition. Solid underlying operating performance aided by focused execution of strategies outlined at mid-2021 investor event to deliver ‘double again’ objective.”

* Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ-T) with an “outperform” rating and $89 target. The average is $92.90.

Analyst Greg Pardy: “Canadian Natural Resources’ management committee structure and shareholder alignment are unique factors which distinguish the company globally. CNQ’s long-life low-decline portfolio—anchored by moderate sustaining capital— affords the company superior free cash flow generative power.”

“Impressive Shareholder Returns. CNQ’s share buyback remains ring-fenced from acquisitions and strategic growth capital under a formulaic approach. More specifically now that net debt levels are below $15 billion the company is allocating 50 per cent of its free cash flow after dividends and sustaining capital to share repurchases with the balance (less strategic growth capital/acquisitions) earmarked for debt reduction.”

* Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP-T) with an “outperform” rating and $122 target. The average is $114.14.

Analyst Walter Spracklin: “Our positive view on CP centers on a best-in-class railroad on the cusp of a transformative acquisition that if approved should set the stage for significant growth and a material upward valuation re-rate.

“CP’s purchase of KSC significantly improves network reach. The network advantage of the CP-KCS deal is the most compelling merit of the transaction in our view. The deal opens up new markets as well as gives CP a meaningful structural advantage versus peers. The transaction significantly increases the company’s network reach from Vancouver to Saint John and now via KCS down to the ports of Lazaro Cardenas and Veracruz in Mexico. The new network connects six of the seven-largest metro regions in North America in a single-line connection particularly between the Midwest US/Canada into the Gulf Coast / Mexico and a new third option between the Midwest US and Texas/Mexico.”

* Element Fleet Management Corp. (EFN-T) with an “outperform” rating and $26 target. The average is $22.08.

Analyst Geoffrey Kwan: “Four key themes drive our positive view of EFN: 1) attractive growth – We forecast that EFN’s EPS could grow at a mid-teens CAGR over the next five years driven by new client wins organic growth within existing customers and significant returns of capital; 2) multiple potential catalysts; 3) strong defensive attributes – EFN faces minimal credit/residual risks and tends to have long-term contracts (3–5 years) with high retention rates (99 per cent); and 4) attractive valuation – we see high EPS growth as a key driver of valuation and potential valuation multiple expansion.”

* Nutrien Ltd. (NTR-N NTR-T) with an “outperform” rating and US$120 target. The average is US$101.95.

Analyst Andrew Wong: “Nutrien is the world’s largest fertilizer producer and ag input retailer formed through the merger of Agrium and PotashCorp in January 2018. We believe the company has built the most diverse vertically integrated agricultural input business with an attractive earnings profile growing free cash flows and solid balance sheet.”

“We expect Nutrien to generate more than $18B in excess cash (after dividends) through 2025 which should be deployed through a combination of share buybacks dividend increases and accretive Retail M&A. We expect the company to continue regular share buybacks and dividend increases.”

* Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR-N QSR-T) with an “outperform” rating and US$80 target. The average is US$67.

Analyst Christopher Carril: “Despite above-average global system sales growth and accelerating comp growth at Burger King and Popeyes QSR’s valuation remains in line with the global “all-franchised” restaurant peer group average driven in large part by continued weakness at Tim Hortons (responsible for 50 per cent of total op. profit). While we believe that TH sales improvement remains the primary catalyst for QSR shares we see the combination of BK-driven near-best-in-class unit growth (normalized 5-per-cent-plus) current momentum at PLK significant scale and potential to add brands in the future as key positives for a stock that in our view remains attractively valued.”

* Telus Corp. (T-T) with an “outperform” rating and $34 target. The average is $33.

Analyst Drew McReynolds: “We view 2022 as a pivotal turning point for TELUS as the company transitions into a new post-FTTH (Fibre To The Home) build / 5G phase. We expect the company to emerge in 2023 with a distinctively different financial and operational profile relative to most global telecom peers. As FTTH coverage reaches 85-90 per cent of the targeted broadband footprint by the end of 2022 enhanced capex flexibility should enable TELUS to capitalize on 5G without meaningful capital constraints opportunity costs or free cash flow impairment. Longer term under certain operational and regulatory conditions we see strong strategic and financial rationale for TELUS to explore a transformational re-organization that can fully unlock the value of core infrastructure assets and core technology assets”

Digital Realty has acquired more land outside of Athens in Greece for future data center development.

The land parcel is located adjacent to the in-development ATH3 and planned ATH4 facilities in Koropi outside Athens.

The company said the site is expected to support the development of new data centers which will connect to Digital Realty’s existing facilities. The full size of the acquired land parcel and the acquisition price were not shared.

Apostolos Kakkos Chairman and CEO of Lamda Hellix (recently rebranded to Digital Realty) said: ""Today with this latest development a personal strategic plan and long-time vision is being realized: firmly placing Greece on the digital map and increasing its competitiveness globally. I’m particularly proud of Digital Realty’s current position as one of the largest providers of data center services in Southeast Europe with three data centers in operation and others under development adding value to Greece’s economy from both an economic and local employment perspective.”

Digital Realty added that Alexandros Bechrakis Lamda Hellix’s Chief Commercial and Technology Officer will succeed Kakkos and be the new Managing Director of Digital Realty’s business in Greece.

Bechkrakis said: “I’d like to thank Apostolos for his exceptional leadership as well as the contributions he has made to Greece through the development of its digital infrastructure. I look forward to continuing his legacy and further building on Greece’s position as a hyperconnected gateway to Southeast Europe.”

Whether Kakkos is remaining with Digital Realty in a wider role is unclear and his LinkedIn hasn’t been updated. DCD has reached out to the CEO for more information.

Update: Kakkos confirmed to DCD that he has moved on and will be ""focusing on other investments in technology real estate and others.""

Lamda Hellix was founded in 2002. Originally built as a cable landing station its first facility Athens-1 opened in 2003 and was the first data center to gain a LEED v4 Gold badge.

It opened Athens-2 in 2016 after weathering the Greek debt crisis. The company broke ground on ATH3 in October 2021 with the facility set to be operational by March 2023. Announced in early December 2022 ATH4 is expected to go live ‘sometime’ in 2024.

The company was acquired by Digital Realty in November 2020 and recently rebranded under the parent company's moniker as part of its retirement of the InterXion brand. Earlier this year it announced plans for a 6.5MW data center on the Greek island of Crete.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9kaWdpdGFsLXJlYWx0eS1hcHBvaW50cy1uZXctY2ZvLWFmdGVyLWFuZHktcG93ZXItYmVjb21lcy1jZW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Realty appoints new CFO after Andy Power becomes CEO,"The company this week announced Mercier as CFO effective January 1 2023. He succeeds Andrew Power who was recently named Chief Executive Officer.

In his new role Mercier will lead the company's global corporate finance organization including treasury capital markets investor relations financial planning and reporting accounting and tax.

""I am extremely excited and honored to step into this role for Digital Realty"" said Mercier. ""Working with the leadership team to grow our business from a small US focused data center owner to the world's largest global full product spectrum owner developer and operator of data centers has been a remarkable experience. We have a long runway for growth ahead of us and I look forward to capitalizing on that opportunity alongside Andy and the rest of our talented team.""

Mercier joined Digital Realty in 2006 most recently serving as Senior Vice President Global Finance & Accounting. Prior to joining Digital Realty he held roles in asset management at Equity Office Properties Trust and as an auditor at KPMG

""Matt has been a great partner and a key leader in our company for more than 15 years. I've appreciated and relied on his steady-handed and thoughtful approach and I look forward to our continued partnership in his new role"" CEO Power said of Mercier’s appointment.

Power was appointed as CEO of Digital Realty last month after the abrupt termination ('without cause and pursuant to his employment contract') of previous CEO Bill Stein.

Power had been the company's CFO since 2015; previously he had served as Managing Director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and was a member of the lead underwriting team that advised Digital Realty on its initial public offering in 2004.

An SEC filing from August 2021 noted Stein’s employment with the company was changed to ""automatically be extended each year for successive one-year periods until either the employer or Mr. Stein provides 60 days written notice of non-extension prior to the expiration of the then-current term.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcGFjaXR5bWVkaWEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMmIzbTlnbHJpY3ZsOGpkeGd2OGNnL25ld3MvZGlnaXRhbC1yZWFsdHktYXBwb2ludHMtbWF0dC1tZXJjaWVyLWFzLWNmb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Realty appoints Matt Mercier as CFO,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.capacitymedia.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/2b3m9glricvl8jdxgv8cg/news/digital-realty-appoints-matt-mercier-as-cfo (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3598A30>, 'Connection to www.capacitymedia.com timed out.

Do you remember CyrusOne CoreSite Realty and QTS Realty Trust? Well between 2021 and 2022 they were taken private by KKR (NYSE: KKR) American Tower (NYSE: AMT) and affiliates of Blackstone (NYSE: BX) respectively. Currently only two data center REITs remain publicly listed – Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ: EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR). There’s also DigitalBridge (NYSE: DBRG) but due to its small size I’ve left it aside. Out of EQIX and DLR the latter looks like the better pick and I’ll discuss why in this piece.

Could Equinix and Digital Realty be taken private as well? I don’t think so. With market caps of $60.6 billion and $29.4 billion respectively they are likely too large for anybody to take them private in the current illiquid market environment. Nevertheless the lofty interest in their (now privately-held) competitors by asset management firms should affirm that data center REITs remain highly-attractive assets.

Why are EQIX and DLR High-Quality Investments?

Growing Dependence on Data Centers

Data Center REITs have become increasingly attractive due to the rising dependence on data and the internet for a broad range of activities. These catalysts are driving demand for data centers which are critical for storing processing and managing large amounts of data.

This trend is likely to continue in the future as cloud computing and other technology solutions that require data storage and processing become increasingly needed. Further due to their role in the operation of many other critical infrastructure systems such as transportation energy healthcare and telecommunications REITs in the space face limited risks in terms of experiencing lower occupancy rates during unfavorable economic periods. A company is more likely to shut its headquarters office first before considering dumping its access to its data centers where all of its critical data is stored.

Stable Cash Flows

Data center REITs know how essential their properties are to their customers which provides them with enough leverage to negotiate long-term tenancy contracts. For context Equinix features a weighted-average remaining lease term of 14 years while Digital Realty’s equivalent metric stands at five years.

Through such long-term contracts with their customers data center REITs enjoy a stable source of cash flows. This makes data centers much more attractive assets than retail commercial or residential properties in that regard. Predictable cash flows also help to mitigate the impact of economic downturns which should ensure data center REITs remain resilient during a potential recession even if their growth rates slow down.

Diversified Cash Flows High Scalability

Data center REITs generate cash flows from several sources such as colocation managed hosting and cloud services. Simultaneously each data center can host multiple tenants. For instance Digital Realty’s multi-tenant data center capacity features more than 170000 cross-connects in critical locations despite owning just over 300 data centers. Diversification through multiple services and customers means that risk is reduced and scalability improves.

Another noteworthy point regarding the scalability of data centers is that most are designed in a modular fashion meaning that they can be easily extended by adding extra components. For instance a data center REIT could add new servers or storage systems to its properties to meet the requirements of its customers with little incremental effort.

Is EQIX Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

Regarding Wall Street’s view on Equinix the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. At $746.61 the average Equinix stock price target suggests 14% upside potential.

Is DLR Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

Analysts forecast even stronger upside potential on Digital Realty with the stock having a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys five Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $119.25 the average Digital Realty stock price target implies 18.9% upside potential.

Takeaway – DLR Stock is Likely the Better Pick

With uncertainty likely to persist in the markets in 2023 investors can benefit from the inherent qualities we just discussed that come attached to EQIX stock and DLR stock. Not only are they set to keep producing robust cash flows in the face of increased uncertainty but being REITs investors should also continue enjoying robust dividends. That said I believe that DLR stock offers a more compelling investment case.

The stock yields a substantial 4.9% and trades at a reasonable forward price/FFO ratio of about 15x based on forecasts for Fiscal 2022 (FFO = funds from operations an earnings metric used by REITs). This should translate into a solid margin of safety if valuations were to be compressed further through the year. The same cannot be said for EQIX stock which trades at a price/FFO ratio of 32x and yields just 1.9%.

Why is the market willing to pay double the price for EQIX stock? I believe this is because the company’s enormous scale is likely to allow for multiple synergies across data centers in the coming years which is likely to lead to better FFO/share growth. Additionally EQIX leases are significantly longer than those of DLR.

Nevertheless paying this much these days especially with interest rates on the rise which can have a major impact on REITs is too risky in my view. DLR’s higher tangible returns and fairer valuation are likely to outperform EQIX if tension among REITs persists.
