At 3M we know the value of skilled trades. That’s why we are working with the National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3) to inspire future technical workers.

In April at an event styled after the NCAA’s National Signing Day 50 students were each awarded a $1000 scholarship to support their education in skilled trades.

“NC3 is trying to bring the excitement and enthusiasm [of choosing a school] and bring visibility to students who choose to pursue technical skills” said Jane Hannon social justice manager in 3M Human Resources. “This was a project that we knew would improve inspire and transform the lives of students.”

The Skilled Trades-3M Transformational Scholarship is aligned with our ongoing commitment to create five million unique STEM and skilled trade learning experiences for underrepresented groups by the end of 2025.

“We know our customers have labor shortages in the skilled trades and we understand students from diverse backgrounds are underrepresented in those fields” said Martha Bennett vice president Global Marketing Excellence 3M Safety & Industrial Business Group. “It is a perfect intersection where we can help solve a 3M customer issue and a community issue at the same time.”

Jacqueline Berry 3Mgives senior manager Education Initiatives said experiences like the scholarship program and 3M’s community work help connect students from underrepresented groups to in-demand but unrecognized career paths.

“There’s a lack of understanding of what jobs are available out there” she said. “At 3M we’ve been finding ways to increase the awareness of STEM and skilled trade jobs and support the development of career pathways for students to decide on a STEM career or a skilled trade opportunity.”

With the help of 3M scholarships students from diverse backgrounds can better build the valuable technical knowledge needed to succeed in a crucial job field.

Now three months later MMM is on the verge of a nearly 10-year bottom. What gives?

Last seen at $108.64 3M stock is down 39% in 2022 and a chip-shot from its Oct. 7 nine-year bottom of $107.08. A mid-August rally above $150 was turned away by the shares' 180-day moving average while the shorter-term 20-day trendline has kept a lid on more recent rallies. However 3M now offers a fair valuation at a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.00 and a price-sales ratio of 1.77. Moreover it provides a very attractive dividend yield of 5.54% at a forward dividend of $5.96.

The business’s growth potential remains limited with estimates predicting a 1.5% decrease in revenue and a 2.2% increase in earnings for fiscal 2022. In addition 3M is expected to report 1.7% revenue growth and 4.5% earnings growth for fiscal 2023 perhaps making the stock most suited as a long-term dividend play.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS8zbS1jby1zdG9jay1yaXNlcy1tb25kYXktb3V0cGVyZm9ybXMtbWFya2V0LTAxNjY1NDMzOTE2LTAwMzhkNGE0MGFhNdIBbmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzLzNtLWNvLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLW1vbmRheS1vdXRwZXJmb3Jtcy1tYXJrZXQtMDE2NjU0MzM5MTYtMDAzOGQ0YTQwYWE1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3M Co. stock rises Monday outperforms market,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS8zbS1jby1zdG9jay1yaXNlcy1tb25kYXktb3V0cGVyZm9ybXMtbWFya2V0LTAxNjY1NDMzOTE2LTAwMzhkNGE0MGFhNdIBbmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzLzNtLWNvLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLW1vbmRheS1vdXRwZXJmb3Jtcy1tYXJrZXQtMDE2NjU0MzM5MTYtMDAzOGQ0YTQwYWE1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7D42980>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS8zbS1jby1zdG9jay1yaXNlcy1tb25kYXktb3V0cGVyZm9ybXMtbWFya2V0LTAxNjY1NDMzOTE2LTAwMzhkNGE0MGFhNdIBbmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzLzNtLWNvLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLW1vbmRheS1vdXRwZXJmb3Jtcy1tYXJrZXQtMDE2NjU0MzM5MTYtMDAzOGQ0YTQwYWE1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvbmlnZXJpYW4tZGF0YS1hbmQtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWNvbXBhbnktc3RlYXJzLXJhaXNlcy0zLTNtLWJhY2tlZC1ieS1tYWMtdmMtYW5kLXNlcmVuYS12ZW50dXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigerian data and intelligence company Stears raises $3.3M backed by Mac VC and Serena Ventures,"While studying at the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford a group of graduates noticed how difficult it was to get data and information on Africa’s largest economy and their home country Nigeria. Each had different yet complementary skills — Michael Famoroti an economist; Bode Ogunlana a software engineer; Abdul Abdulrahim a data scientist; and Preston Ideh a corporate lawyer — and in 2017 they launched a media startup to address the dearth of information and data-driven insights in the West African country.

Five years on this startup Stears is announcing a $3.3 million seed round led by MaC Venture Capital. Serena Ventures Omidyar Group’s Luminate Fund Melo 7 Tech Partners and Cascador (Empowering Economic Growth Foundation) participated. This news is coming two years after Stears raised $650000 in pre-seed funding. Last month it was one of the 60 startups to get accepted into the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund 2022 cohort which included some non-dilutive funding.

Stears started as a media publication focused on financial news and insights in Nigeria. Its flagship subscription insights product Stears Premium contains content ranging from news and opinion pieces to investigative pieces and deep dives educating the general public on issues around business and finance economy government and policy in Nigeria. The $100-a-year product witnessed significant usage among consumers particularly employees working in various finance-related institutions across the country. And because these institutions have more spending power Stears subsequently tailored the product to businesses who wanted to subscribe on behalf of their teams. Some of its subscribers include financial institutions like Sterling Bank and fintechs like Sparkle PiggyVest and Paystack. The company says its userbase has grown mainly organically at around 6.5% month-on-month doubling its total number of users over the last year.

“We have a strong understanding of the kind of information people need. So our focus is on standardizing information dissemination and building with the customer in mind” Ideh told TechCrunch in an interview. “An essential part of our business model is pushing out high-value subscription data products for instance proprietary forecast models. Conversely the low-value end will be news so customers’ willingness to spend changes as they go along the spectrum.”

The iteration of Stears Premium alongside the introduction of other products Stears Pro and Stears Advisory has seen Stears morph into a data and intelligence company. Macro trends and topics like GDP and inflation drive content on Stears Premium. Stears Pro on the other hand provides more bespoke content around specific issues such as market entry country analysis and digital economy for international organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and the knowledge workers—people need a great deal of data for their work which may include roles such as analysts portfolio managers researchers and economists—that work in them.

But in a bid to support its transition from an insights company to a data company and buoyed by this new investment Stears is planning a strategy modification for the Pro product. According to the company’s COO and data scientist Abdulrahim the data outfit is working with international development institutions and financial institutions to produce proprietary and exclusive datasets that don’t exist anywhere else. Therefore instead of reporting insights from the data it sources Stears wants to collate data engage in deep data analytics and present it to its business customers in various formats.

“An essential part of our business model is pushing out high-value subscription data products. And as we advance we’ll do less custom work for this set of customers and focus more on overall data around the same sector” added Ideh on the direction Stears is taking with its Pro product. “So the difference in output is such that in the past we put out reports but in the future we’re probably going to put out data feeds. So less text-heavy way of publishing and more of forecast and prediction around sectors that matter to knowledge workers and their organizations.”

Stears Advisory — the product where Stears wears its consultancy hat and takes on third-party projects around its core coverage — is taking a rear seat as the company intends to double down on Pro and Premium. CEO Ideh explained that while the Advisory product which he likens to a research and development (R&D) arm sponsored by different partners allows Stears to experiment with data collection and analysis and provides the bedrock to carve out further insights it’s not scalable and lacks the sort of recurring revenue that venture-backed businesses need.

So far the company’s strategy seems to be paying off. Enterprise customers now contribute over 75% of revenues generated up from 45% in 2021. It also expects revenues to double from last year as half-year revenues for 2022 have already surpassed full-year revenues for 2021. This is compared to the 80% revenue growth between FY 2021 and FY 2020.

As a data and intelligence company Stears finds itself in a sweet spot where it is incentivized to pursue political projects that would draw attention if it were a media or tech company. In 2019 the company embarked on one such project as it developed Nigeria’s first real-time election database. Over 2 million Nigerians used it to monitor the general elections. Ideh said his company intends to relaunch the election data site this time with more datasets and functionalities in anticipation of Nigeria’s 2023 elections.

“Bloomberg at its core is a data company; we love how they approach elections and our approach in 2019 was driven by them” said Ideh who has always been vocal about Stears building the Bloomberg of Africa. “This is a big open data effort for us and we are also excited about polling because it is a very important form of data verification currently missing in Nigeria. And so over the election period we will run and push out statistically representative polls on Nigeria using strong data mindsets to get a sense of public opinion issues and achieve more robust results.”

According to Ideh the seed investment will take Stears from a v2.0 a Nigerian insight company to a v3.0 a data company focused on Africa. The company plans to use the investment to enhance its data collection and analytics capabilities hire data scientists data analysts and sector analysts and expand to east Africa through Kenya southern Africa through the eponymous country and north Africa through Egypt.

“Africa is home to the first humans and is now the next frontier for business” said Marlon Nichols co-founder and managing general partner at lead investor MaC Venture Capital on the investment. “Many multinational corporations and governments understand this to be a reality. They also appreciate that several African countries are subject to unique business processes and are primarily cash-based economies which results in understated GDP among other things. Stears is uniquely positioned to provide the proprietary and accurate data needed to unlock trade and deeper business relationships with African countries and companies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwL25pa2UtYWNnLWFpci16b29tLWdhaWFkb21lLWd0eC1ibGFjay1yZWxlYXNlLWluZm_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Nike ACG Zoom Gaiadome GTX ""Black"" Release","Nike ACG‘s Zoom Gaiadome GTX boots were first revealed as an eye-catching FlyEase model exclusive to the Team USA athletes for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

HOUSTON — Gov. Greg Abbott and his opponent for the governor’s seat Beto O’Rourke made stops in Houston on Sunday.

Abbott and O’Rourke are pushing to get supporters out to the polls as well as sway undecided voters.

The November mid-term election is just under 30 days away.

Abbott was at the Hilton Americas alongside Rep. Dan Crenshaw at the annual “Crenshaw Youth Summit” where Abbott made an appeal to the young conservative voters.

""You are proving otherwise the future of America is conservative and you are those conservatives” Abbott said during the fireside chat.

Abbott’s discussion highlighted the ongoing fentanyl crisis migrants and border security.

""Texas is the first and only state to build our own border wall to secure the sovereignty of the great state of Texas and the United States of America” he said.

In a recent sit-down interview with KHOU 11 News during his “college tour” O’Rourke shared similar goals of grabbing the attention of young voters.

On Sunday O’Rourke attended a town hall at the Tidwell Community Center where he answered questions from the community. During the town hall he touched on issues of healthcare equality wages and education reform.

""What about raising the minimum wage at least $15 an hour so you don't have to work two or three jobs ... having the backs of our public-school educators -- show them the respect that they deserve and earn” O’Rourke said",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9nb3Zlcm5vci1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1zbGFtbWVkLW5ldy10di1hZC1kYXplZC1jb25mdXNlZC1kaXJlY3Rvci0xNzUwNTYy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Governor Greg Abbott slammed in new TV ad by ""Dazed and Confused"" director",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/governor-greg-abbott-slammed-new-tv-ad-dazed-confused-director-1750562 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9nb3Zlcm5vci1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1zbGFtbWVkLW5ldy10di1hZC1kYXplZC1jb25mdXNlZC1kaXJlY3Rvci0xNzUwNTYy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlcmFuZXdzLm9yZy9oZWFsdGgtd2VsbG5lc3MvMjAyMi0xMC0xMC90cmFucy15b3V0aC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS10ZXhhcy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWdyZWctYWJib3R00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What life is like for trans youth in Texas after Abbott's calls to investigate gender-affirming care,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlcmFuZXdzLm9yZy9oZWFsdGgtd2VsbG5lc3MvMjAyMi0xMC0xMC90cmFucy15b3V0aC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS10ZXhhcy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWdyZWctYWJib3R00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7FFAAA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlcmFuZXdzLm9yZy9oZWFsdGgtd2VsbG5lc3MvMjAyMi0xMC0xMC90cmFucy15b3V0aC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS10ZXhhcy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWdyZWctYWJib3R00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

As Amneal winds down operations at its oral solids site in Hauppauge New York the company has disclosed 13 job cuts planned to go into effect “on or about December 31 2022” according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notice in the state.

The plant employs a total 89 workers according to the filing with the remaining 76 staffers expected to continue to work through March 2023.

“The business will be restructuring operations of its Hauppauge facility and will be closing the location in March of 2023” the notice continues. The employees are not represented by any union.

Fierce Pharma reached out to Amneal for comment about the plant closure but the company did not respond by press time.

The layoffs appear to be part of a cost-cutting initiative Amneal first rolled out in 2018. In a recent form 10-K the company said that as part of that plan it expected to “reduce its headcount by approximately 300 to 350 employees primarily by closing its manufacturing facility located in Hauppauge NY.”

The Hauppauge plant is one of two Amneal operates in Suffolk County with a specific focus on oral solids production the company says on its website. Aside from a plethora of sites in New Jersey plus a sales and distribution center in Glasgow Kentucky Amneal runs another Long Island manufacturing location in Brookhaven NY where it cranks out oral solids soft gels and high-potency hormonal products.

Across biopharma job cuts have been plentiful in 2022. While especially pronounced in the biotech sector the layoff spree has extended to big-name commercial players too.

Last month a California WARN notice revealed that AbbVie and Bristol Myers Squibb plan to lay off 99 and 261 employees respectively.

Novartis has also revealed sweeping job cuts and recently announced it was closing shop at its Sandoz oral solid generics plant in Wilson North Carolina by the end of 2023. The site’s roughly 246 employees had previously been alerted to the closure a Novartis spokesperson said in an August email.

Elsewhere on the generics front Teva Pharmaceutical is bidding adieu to 305 staffers at its troubled site in Irvine California—also unveiled via WARN notice this summer.

""The Teva Irvine facility will not resume production and the company is either transferring or ceasing production of medicines made at the site"" a Teva spokesperson later confirmed with Fierce Pharma.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9zaHVhY29oZW4vMjAyMi8xMC8xMC90dXJuaW5nLXZlcnktb2xkLWRydWdzLWxpa2UtbWFrZW5hLWludG8tcHJvZml0cy1yZWd1bGF0b3J5LXJlZm9ybS1uZWVkZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turning Very Old Drugs Like Makena Into Profits: Regulatory Reform Needed,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2022/10/10/turning-very-old-drugs-like-makena-into-profits-regulatory-reform-needed/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9zaHVhY29oZW4vMjAyMi8xMC8xMC90dXJuaW5nLXZlcnktb2xkLWRydWdzLWxpa2UtbWFrZW5hLWludG8tcHJvZml0cy1yZWd1bGF0b3J5LXJlZm9ybS1uZWVkZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

A team from Indian School of Business (ISB) won the Accenture B-School challenge 2022. IIM Lucknow and IIM Udaipur were the first and second runners-up respectively. The Faculty of Management Studies team was recognised with a special jury award. Students comprising the top three winning teams have landed a pre-placement interview opportunity with Accenture. Additionally all three teams received prizes cumulatively worth ₹10 lakh.

More than 8400 students from 16 B-schools in India participated in the sixth edition of the challenge on the theme — ‘Modernising industries: Reinvention starts here.’ The month-long competition aims to identify top talent for the digital economy and put a spotlight on the changing business landscape and the actions leaders need to undertake to thrive amid current disruptions.

Stages of competition

The challenge was divided into four stages. The first round featured a rapid-fire quiz to test their analytical skills which was followed by a round of business simulation where students role-played CEOs and shared their perspectives on driving business profitability. Close to 160 teams were short-listed at the end of the second round.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will be forced to spend heavily on capital expenditure due to aggressive spending by its rival the Korean chaebol Samsung's chipmaking division Samsung Foundry according to an analyst. These comments come as TSMC prepares for its third quarter earnings report earlier this week with all eyes on the company as the personal computing industry suffers from macroeconomic shocks and takes down heavy hitters such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) NVIDIA Corporation and Intel Corporation with it.

TSMC's To Defer Capital Expenditure To 2023 In Wake Of Supply Chain Constraints

According to the details an analyst quoted by the United Daily News (UDN) believes that TSMC's capital expenditure in 2023 will touch another record high. This will come despite the firm grappling with cost increases and demand slowdown for its customers which should instead prompt it to spend wisely in capacity in order to ensure that machines are not left idle.

However a key factor in TSMC's capital expenditure decision is Samsung's aggressive spending. The Korean firm whose manufacturing technologies were caught in claims of fraudulent behavior earlier this year was quick to announce 3-nanometer manufacturing earlier this year and followed this up with announcing production for the newer 2-nanomter technology which also meets TSMC's 2-nanometer production timeline.

These announcements will have to be backed up with heavy capital spending and Samsung plans to spend a whopping $355 billion on its semiconductor and biotechnology business over the next five years. Reports have also indicated that the bulk of this spending will be in chip manufacturing particularly due to the high costs of setting up expensive machines and facilities.

Therefore according to today's report TSMC will have to spend aggressively as well not only if it is to maintain its lead in Samsung in the global contract chip manufacturing industry but also if it is to gain a strong foothold in the market for next generation technologies such as 2-nanometer. Both TSMC and Samsung plan to kick. off 2-nanometer manufacturing in 2025 and will have to use advanced chip manufacturing machines for it.

The analyst believes that these factors will compel TSMC to boost its spending next year and some of this allocation will come from this year's spending. Higher costs and an industry downturn will push TSMC to allocate some of this year's spending to 2023 with this year's expenditures amounting close to $40 billion and next year's surpassing $41 billion according to today's report. Investment bank JPMorgan had expected the capital expenditure to sit at $42 this year in a January note.

Capital spending in the semiconductor industry is slowing according to research firm IC Insights. This is mostly due to a slowing macroeconomic environment and oversupply in the industry and in 2023 the research firm believes that the industry will spend $185 billion collectively. This will result in a slower growth rate of 35% over last year's 21% but it still marks the third consecutive year of double digit growth in spending. Spending had dropped in 2019 but picked up afterwards as demand for chip products grew in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic due to record demand for personal computing enterprise and automotive products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC13YXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1NDc5L3NoZW56aGVuLXBsYW5zLXNob3dlci1jYXNoLWxvY2FsLWNoaXAtaW5kdXN0cnktYm9sc3Rlci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC13YXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1NDc5L3NoZW56aGVuLXBsYW5zLXNob3dlci1jYXNoLWxvY2FsLWNoaXAtaW5kdXN0cnktYm9sc3Rlci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shenzhen plans to shower cash on its local chip industry,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC13YXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1NDc5L3NoZW56aGVuLXBsYW5zLXNob3dlci1jYXNoLWxvY2FsLWNoaXAtaW5kdXN0cnktYm9sc3Rlci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC13YXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1NDc5L3NoZW56aGVuLXBsYW5zLXNob3dlci1jYXNoLWxvY2FsLWNoaXAtaW5kdXN0cnktYm9sc3Rlci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7FFA890>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC13YXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1NDc5L3NoZW56aGVuLXBsYW5zLXNob3dlci1jYXNoLWxvY2FsLWNoaXAtaW5kdXN0cnktYm9sc3Rlci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC13YXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1NDc5L3NoZW56aGVuLXBsYW5zLXNob3dlci1jYXNoLWxvY2FsLWNoaXAtaW5kdXN0cnktYm9sc3Rlci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Air Products (NYSE: APD) the world leader in hydrogen production and a first mover developing and executing low carbon hydrogen megaprojects driving the energy transition announced plans to invest approximately $500 million to build own and operate a 35 metric ton per day facility to produce green liquid hydrogen at a greenfield site in Massena New York as well as liquid hydrogen distribution and dispensing operations.

The commercial operation of this facility is targeted to begin in 2026-2027.

In support of this Air Products’ project in July 2022 the New York Power Authority (NYPA) board approved 94 MW of low-cost St. Lawrence hydroelectric power to Air Products for its significant investment and the creation of 90 jobs in New York State.

This project supports New York State’s goal of becoming a Regional Clean Energy Hydrogen Hub as announced by Governor Kathy Hochul in March 2022. New York’s hydrogen hub ambitions directly support the goals of the State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.

Air Products has determined that the market demand warrants the investment in the project assuming the receipt of certain local and state incentives as well as any benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and which are anticipated in the current project budget.

Further to this proposed facility announcement Air Products is also investigating the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen fueling station network in the United States’ northeast region including the ability to serve Air Products’ truck fleet. Air Products has announced plans to convert its global fleet of approximately 2000 trucks to hydrogen fuel cell zero-emission vehicles.

Seifi Ghasemi Air Products’ Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer said:

We are very pleased to announce this proposed project as this shows our commitment to work closely with New York State to support its energy transition program by making real investments and creating highly paid jobs with our Massena green hydrogen project.

“This project is another demonstration of our leadership role in the low-carbon hydrogen and the hydrogen for mobility markets and New York State’s and IRA incentives will continue to encourage hydrogen’s key role and our investment in the energy transition.”

Justin E. Driscoll NYPA Interim President and CEO said:

In supporting Air Products’ expansion in Massena NYPA is furthering New York’s aggressive climate goals and helping to advance the state’s vision of becoming a regional hydrogen hub.

“The St. Lawrence-FDR Power Project is a critical economic development catalyst in the

region — and around the state — and we are pleased to leverage its clean hydropower to strengthen the North Country’s economy.”

The low-carbon intensity liquid hydrogen product from the facility is expected to be sold to the mobility market in New York State as well as other potential northeast industrial markets.

If all the hydrogen is used for the heavy-duty truck market future climate benefits over the project’s lifetime would include avoiding more than six million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is equivalent to the emissions from over 600 million gallons of diesel used in heavy-duty trucks.

Demand for green hydrogen for mobility and industrial applications is expected to grow significantly in the northeast as a result of the New York-led multi-state agreement to develop a proposal to become one of the regional clean hydrogen hubs designated through the federal Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program and New York State’s adoption of a new Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) rule. New York State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act targets include: 40 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions below 1990 levels by 2030 a carbon free electricity system by 2040 and an 85 percent reduction in GHGs below 1990 levels by 2050.

“My family’s had a longstanding connection to the UMass system down on the SouthCoast region” said Stephen Karam. “Beyond civic duty it’s also personal.”

Gov. Charlie Baker appointed Karam a member of the university system’s board since 2017 to the position of chair last month. He succeeded Robert Manning who this year completed the two terms allowed UMass trustees.

Karam’s father Robert Karam and uncle James Karam both also previously served as board chairs for the five-campus UMass system. Robert played a key role in having what was then known as Southeastern Massachusetts University join the system as UMass Dartmouth while James helped establish UMass Law School which is based on the Dartmouth campus.

Stephen Karam the new chair of the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees.

Karam grew up in Fall River and went through the city’s public school system through high school as did his parents and children. He served on the board of trustees for Bristol Community College from 1996 to 2007.

“We are huge proponents of higher education” he said.

""So much more independent"": These Somerset Berkley students are running their own business

Now he works as a principal at Karam Financial Group a firm in Fall River which his father started.

Karam said the university system will face the challenge of a shrinking pool of people looking to attend college in the next four or five years part of a projected national trend that many schools will have to adapt to. And they face the consistent challenge of keeping the public college system as affordable as possible.

But overall the system is in a strong position he said. Enrollment at UMass colleges is on the rise even while national college enrollment is declining. UMass has improved its finances in recent years and become increasingly competitive schools that are now all nationally ranked he said.

“UMass even coming through COVID has never been stronger” Karam said. “We’ve been able to make our five campuses as real destinations for students to enroll.”

Pivot Bio with an office in Ames reported that it tripled its acres covered from 2021 to 2022

The products could be good for the environment. They're also appealing amid high synthetic fertilizer prices

Independent research is limited troubling some soil scientists

AMES – In a cornfield at the Iowa State University Research Park white placards stand every couple of yards.

“Pivot Bio” the first one reads. “Applied Nitrogen Rate 200 Lbs/Acre.”

""160 lbs"" reads the next sign.

""0 Lbs"" reads a third.

The numbers represent the amount of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied to each part of the field according to researchers at Pivot Bio a deep-pocketed startup that aims to upend the crop nutrient business.

The company which started in California and opened an Ames office last summer offers farmers a new source for nitrogen a key nutrient for corn. Nitrogen use has exploded over the last 60 years as farmers have supplied more synthetic fertilizer. The practice drives Iowa's expanding production of food animal feed ethanol starch and other commodity derivatives.

Excess nitrogen fertilizer however creates hazards in the air and water. Prices have also skyrocketed over the last two years squeezing farm profit margins.

Pivot Bio has offered a solution: billions of miniscule gene-edited microbes that cling to a plant's roots pull nitrogen from the air and convert the nutrient to a form the crop can absorb. The company's executives say the product allows farmers to cut back on the amount of synthetic fertilizer they apply to a field without losing yield.

When the product launched in 2018 Pivot Bio told customers they could cut back synthetic nitrogen by 25 pounds an acre. This year company leaders said they had improved gene editing of the microbes enough that farmers could cut back 40 pounds an acre. Eventually the company hopes that farmers won't have to apply nitrogen fertilizer at all.

The pitch has appealed to many farmers because of rising fertilizer costs. Natural gas is the main ingredient in ammonia and urea fertilizers. Driven in part by a drop in the European supply of natural gas the nitrogen fertilizer diammonium phosphate cost $954 a metric ton this April more than triple the $282 two years ago according to Bloomberg News. Other nitrogen fertilizers have followed the same trend.

Spread over a 360-acre farm the price swing since 2020 could cost a farmer an extra $18000. Pivot Bio promises to cut into that pain.

“It’s simple math” spokesperson Tracy Willits said at the company's field outside the research park on a warm September afternoon.

Funding surge marketing blitz for microbe maker

Pivot Bio and other microbial fertilizer companies have won investors’ attention raising $1 billion last year according to the venture capital research firm AgFunder. Established fertilizer players like Nutrien Ltd. and Bayer AG are researching microbial options as well.

Among the startups Pivot Bio is the vanguard perhaps the hottest product in ag innovation next to automated tractors. Since starting in 2011 the company has raised $617 million including a $420 million round last summer with backing from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures Bunge Ltd.’s venture capital arm and Temasek Holdings Ltd. Singapore’s state investment firm.

Pivot Bio has engaged in a marketing blitz in recent years. The company posts frequent Facebook and Twitter ads. It's a sponsor of agriculture podcasts and web shows and the athletics programs at Iowa State University and the University of Iowa. U.S. Rep Randy Feenstra and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley both Iowa Republicans promoted Pivot Bio in August during the annual Farm Progress Show in Boone.

Willits said Pivot Bio received $50 million in revenue this year and was planted on 3 million acres triple its reported footprint in 2021. The company sold out of product “well before planting season"" this year Willits said.

At the beginning of September Pivot Bio promoted a new iteration that farmers can apply directly to seed instead of spraying it into furrows. Willits declined to say how much the company expects its sales to grow this season. But Pivot Bio executives want to increase the number of independent dealers selling their products to 1800 from 1000.

“The farmer demand is intense” Willits said. “And the curiosity about what we’re doing and the value we can deliver to them is quite high. What that says to us is farmers are ready and want more options.”

Yet some outside experts say microbial fertilizers aren’t backed by much independent research. They say Pivot Bio has recently taken to requiring professors to sign nondisclosure agreements that give the company oversight of any published data.

Willits said the nondisclosure agreements are necessary to ""ensure that our product is managed consistently and stewarded according to label directions resulting in high quality data."" She said the company has partnered with 15 universities since 2019 with new study results on the way ""in the coming months.""

“The most critical thing is that we develop relationships with growers and that we prove our ability to perform on their farm” said Pat Yockey a Pivot Bio commercial agronomist. “If we do well we’ll continue to see demand.”

Synthetic fertilizer costly not just in price but also to the environment

Any crop whether it’s corn or tobacco or pears reflects the nutrients it absorbs.

In the 19th century European researchers realized that nitrogen played a particularly important role. But while they could find plenty of nitrogen in the air natural nitrogen in a form that plants could consume was relatively rare spread through animal waste human waste and crop residue.

German scientist Fritz Haber discovered a solution while doing research for the chemical company BASF in 1909. He applied extreme heat and pressure to natural gas and air breaking up tightly bound atoms and joining together hydrogen and nitrogen. The process created ammonium a form of nitrogen that plants could absorb.

German scientist Carl Bosch a BASF employee figured out how to expand Haber's method to an industrial scale. The method became known as the Haber-Bosch process and both men went on to win Nobel Prizes in chemistry.

The process created synthetic nitrogen fertilizer which boosted crop yields. Also U.S. and European militaries used the process to make bombs.

In the years after World War II according to “Enriching the Earth” by Vaclav Smil companies turned U.S. munitions plants into synthetic fertilizer factories. The product helped usher in the “Green Revolution” of the 1960s when food production accelerated.

The popularity of synthetic fertilizer however also came with a steep environmental cost. The manufacturing process emits carbon dioxide. When farmers spread too much synthetic nitrogen — as they often do to assure a strong yield — the crops can’t absorb all the nutrients. Excess nitrogen remains in the soil. Some microbes consume the nitrogen and emit nitrous oxide into the air.

Nitrous oxide has 265 times as much global warming potential as carbon dioxide based on how long the compound remains in the atmosphere and its ability to reflect heat. Researchers at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy Greenpeace and GRAIN concluded last year that the synthetic fertilizer industry warms the planet about 38% more than the commercial aviation business.

Kristie Boering an earth sciences professor at the University of California Berkeley estimates that the amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere increased 5% from 1900 to 1960. From then until 2021 the amount increased 13% ― more than double over the same period. Boering said the rise of synthetic fertilizer explains the difference.

In addition to polluting the air excess nitrogen in the soil is picked up by water that leaches into wells and rivers. The runoff has reached the Gulf of Mexico and created a “dead zone” an area surrounding the mouth of the Mississippi River where algae blooms fueled by excess nutrients suck the oxygen from the water.

“Something’s got to give” said Bill Brady CEO of Boston-based Kula Bio another microbe startup that closed a $50 million funding round in January. “We need the food. But there’s no way we can continue to pollute like that.”

Can microbes transform the fertilizer market?

Companies like Pivot Bio and Kula Bio claim their products can solve the problem. Pivot's microbes “fixate” nitrogen meaning they pull the nutrient from the air and convert it into a form that plants can use. Essentially the tiny bugs are clean fertilizer factories.

The company's scientists edit the microbes' genes to behave the way some already do around legumes like soybeans. Microbes will bind to the roots of those plants. The plants feed the microbes. The microbes in turn give the plants nitrogen.

The microbes don't naturally provide nitrogen to the roots of cereals like rice corn and wheat. Pivot Bio says genetic information tells the microbes not to convert air into nitrogen when they are already surrounded by the nutrient in the soil. Pivot Bio's scientists have changed that gene.

David Kanter vice chair of the International Nitrogen Initiative said decreasing the nutrient's use is as important to staving off the effects of global warming as curtailing car and aircraft emissions. But unlike in Europe he said U.S. regulations around agriculture rarely involve mandates. Policymakers instead rely on incentives to make eco-friendly practices more profitable.

If Pivot Bio can provide a cheaper alternative to nitrogen fertilizers it will have the same incentive effect.

“If (Pivot Bio is) successful it would essentially transform the nitrogen input market” said Kanter who is on the company's advisory board. “Nitrogen in the end would essentially be a supplement instead of being a baseload on the plant.”

Farmers weigh whether data justifies switching products

On his Audubon farm James Nelson was tempted to try Pivot Bio the last three years. But his planter isn't equipped to spray the liquid product into furrows.

With the company now offering a version that puts the microbes directly on seeds Nelson said he will buy the product before next year’s planting season. He plans to try Pivot on a small portion of his farm and cut back his nitrogen fertilizer application to 130 pounds an acre from his usual 170 pounds.

He said Pivot Bio’s advertisements about saving on fertilizer have appealed to him. He is paying about 73 cents a pound for nitrogen this year up from 32 cents two years ago.

More:Gov. Kim Reynolds has controlled $2.7 billion in federal COVID-19 aid. Here's how she's spending it.

His dealer offered to sell him Pivot Bio’s product for $24 an acre about $5.30 an acre less than what he pays for fertilizer. With corn selling for $6.75 a bushel the deal would work for Nelson only if the product doesn’t cost him any yield.

He is skeptical.

“The more I look at it the more I think ‘Why bother?’” he said over the phone in early October taking a break from running his combine in a soybean field. “But I’m still curious.”

According to Pivot Bio company researchers examined the effect of its product on 2400 fields this year. The company said it compared the weight of the biomass and the chlorophyl concentration in the leaves of Pivot Bio-treated corn to those of similar untreated corn. The company said that despite using less nitrogen fertilizer the Pivot Bio-treated corn had 14% more nitrogen in it ― a sign that the plants were healthier.

Aaron Erb a farmer and seed dealer in Wellman said his yields with Pivot are consistent even though he's cut his use of nitrogen. He said Pivot Bio’s research has swayed many of his customers.

“The data is finally enough I suppose to trust it and change their farms over” he said.

Willits the company spokesperson said Pivot Bio has research projects in the pipeline with the University of Georgia Iowa State University and Purdue University. Ecology professor Steven Hall who is conducting the Iowa State research declined to say what he's found so far telling the Des Moines Register that his study is still pending.

University researcher: 'My God. What are you people thinking about?'

Other researchers are dubious. Dave Franzen a North Dakota State University Extension soil specialist said he tried to study Pivot Bio this year after receiving a grant in April. At that point he said dealers told him they were sold out of the product.

He said the company offered to give him the product if he signed a nondisclosure agreement which he declined to do. He is studying two other company's products instead. He said he is “troubled” by Pivot Bio’s popularity among farmers.

“My God” he said. “What are you people thinking about? I’m a scientist. I look at data. I’m not wowed by marketing. But a lot of people are.”

University of Minnesota nutrient management professor Daniel Kaiser meanwhile said he managed to conduct independent research on Pivot Bio in six studies from 2019 to 2021. He said he studied the product without a nondisclosure agreement.

Kaiser criticized the framing around much of Pivot Bio’s advertising. He said he doesn’t believe the product necessarily works even if the crop yield remains stable while farmers decrease their nitrogen fertilizer use. Farmers often overapply fertilizer he said. They may cut back and still see stable yields without Pivot Bio.

To measure the product's performance Kaiser compared fields with much less fertilizer per acre than what a farmer would normally use. In control fields he used only nitrogen fertilizer. In other fields he used Pivot's product and a reduced amount of fertilizer.

In his six studies he concluded that yield increased with Pivot just one time.

“Getting consistency out of it is the main issue” Kaiser said. “It’s kind of in stark contrast to what the company will claim.”

He didn’t study Pivot in 2022 though he wants to return to the product. At the same time he said his contact at Pivot told him this year that the company was changing some practices and that it was no longer engaging with outside research.

“I’d like to be able to see if I can replicate (the positive results) and figure it out” Kaiser said. “There might be specific circumstances where it works. … I don’t know where this is going to go.”

Part of the solution: '23andMe for soil'

In a southeast Ames laboratory white-coated employees pull cups of soil from sacks and drop them into pinky-sized tubes. The tubes are also filled with tiny beaters. The employees place a tray of tubes into a machine.

The machine shakes the trays. Inside each tube the beaters go to work cracking open the cells of the billions of microbes embedded in the soil.

Employees move the tubes to a centrifuge which whirls the tubes in loops like a stomach-churning carnival ride. The dirt sinks to the bottom of the tube. The delicate strands of the microbial DNA float to the top.

Employees clean the DNA and place it in a sequencer a machine that looks like a printer and provides genetic information about the billions of microbes in the samples.

The process unfolds at Trace Genomics a startup that aims to be an important cog in the microbe fertilizer business. The company which started in 2016 describes itself as “23andMe for Soil” a resource for farmers who want to know the genetic profiles of the microbes in their fields.

Not all microbes behave the same said Pat Dumstorff the product lead for Trace Genomics. Knowing what kinds are in different parts of a field will help farmers better understand how much fertilizer to apply.

The company works with agronomists and offers detailed prescriptions. Trace Genomics currently analyzes the DNA of microbes that deliver phosphorous to plants. Dumstorff said the feedback helps farmers decide how much phosphorous fertilizer to buy.

He said the company hopes to offer a similar analysis for nitrogen but the microbes that provide it are more complicated. The company needs more time to learn how to deliver accurate feedback.

“Phosphorous is like checkers” he said. “Nitrogen is like chess.”

The company has managed to capitalize on the recent wave of microbial fertilizers though. Trace Genomics began consulting with businesses researching microbial products last fall.

The company operates a greenhouse at its Ames site where Trace Genomics researchers plant crops with different proposed products. The researchers check the level of nutrients reaching the crops over time.

With efficacy difficult to discern will bad actors emerge?

Verdesian Life Sciences a North Carolina company receives feedback from Trace Genomics about its pending phosphorous product.

Before farmers apply fertilizer plenty of phosphorous already exists in the soil said Kuide Qin Verdesian’s chief science officer. But most of the phosphorous isn’t in a form that plants can consume. The company is experimenting with microbes that are supposed to transform the phosphorous making it consumable by the plants.

The theory is good Qin said. Execution is difficult.

A former scientist for Dow Chemical and Bayer Qin said he is used to researching chemicals like pesticides. Those products generally work in all conditions. If they failed Qin knew within a couple days.

But microbes work more slowly he said. Farmers often don’t know if a product has lived up to a company’s claims until they see the yield at harvest. Microbes don’t work in all conditions either.

They perform their tasks for different lengths of time. They work best at specific stages. They thrive in different environments.

“It’s hard to figure out the efficacy of the product” Qin said.

Prasanna Kankanala the soil science manager at Trace Genomics said the hype surrounding microbial fertilizers concerns her.

Successful products could forever clean up farming. But their appeal ― and optimistic investors' deep pockets ― have the potential to attract bad actors.

She said government agencies don't regulate product purity enough meaning different microbial fertilizers can perform differently with similar advertised ingredients. Businesses can mislead farmers she said. (Pivot Bio follows labeling guidance from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials and receives authorization from state agencies before selling commercially in a jurisdiction Willits said.)

Researchers say the field is fertile for ""snake oil."" Kankanala worries the excitement around microbes will fade if early commercial versions don't work.

""The grower will never trust the product"" she said. ""And the word of mouth is going to spread like wildfire.”

Most Magical Experience – recognising Experience Hosts who through their expertise and passion have the ability to immerse guests in a whole new world

WINNER: New Zealand Nature Highlights Palmerston North

About the Experience: This Magical Experience in Palmerston North was sparked by an idea during lockdown in 2020. Arthur was talking to a friend who worked in Dubai who found it difficult to travel home to California. Instead she connected with friends and family by signing up to a number of online experiences. Arthur then signed up to a number of online experiences himself and thoroughly enjoyed them connecting with a host live who was more than 4000 miles away.

The experience triggered an idea where Arthur said to his wife that it would be cool to curate a farm tour experience and share it with people around the world who were in lockdown due to the pandemic. Arthur pursued this idea as a ‘side gig’ which eventually led him to become an Airbnb Experience Host.

“The live-streaming experience is both entertaining and educational. Different content is curated to ensure different demographics get the most out of the farm tour. For example I share how I care for the farm animals the impact of climate change on farming practices and my life as an immigrant on a lifestyle farm in Country New Zealand. The farm tours are hosted in English or Mandarin enabling me to reach out to a wider audience base in Asia.

Additionally the farm tours are hosted when the weather is great when it is raining and even when it’s pitch black! It can be challenging but it’s about offering a unique experience to guests and to showcase the best of New Zealand to the world!”

Judge Felicity Stevens: “While this experience is about farm life in New Zealand the guests are left feeling like they have met an incredibly kind passionate patient farmer who shows incredible care for his animals and the environment. Arthur sounds like the perfect ambassador for New Zealand farming life. Guests warm to him and love his stories about his life on the farm. Guests also leave feeling like they have learnt more about farming and animals and the environment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvYWlyYm5iLWNlby1zYXlzLWZlZS10cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktaXMtbm93LXRvcC1wcmlvcml0eS_SAVZodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL2FpcmJuYi1jZW8tc2F5cy1mZWUtdHJhbnNwYXJlbmN5LWlzLW5vdy10b3AtcHJpb3JpdHkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb CEO Says He’ll Fix Fees 17 Months After Launching Review,"From a technical standpoint Airbnb already has the ability to show the total price up-front. Clamping down on host-set cleaning fees would create a firestorm — among hosts.

Some 17 months after Global Head of Hosting Catherine Powell designated a team to review Airbnb’s fee structure and the way it displays fees to travelers CEO Brian Chesky tweeted that redesigning pricing for an Airbnb stay is a top priority.

In responding to a fintech investor on Twitter who complained that sometimes Airbnb prices nearly double because of fees when it comes time to pay compared to the initially displayed nightly rate Chesky tweeted Monday: “You are correct — the cleaning fees were never intentionally designed which is why we’re now playing catch up. This is one of my top priorities — we are redesigning how pricing on Airbnb works.”

Chesky’s tweets which kicked off last week with a shoutout to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs about the primacy of user experience came as Airbnb has received a torrent of criticism about its cleaning fees which are set by hosts.

You are correct – the cleaning fees were never intentionally designed which is why we're now playing catch up. This is one of my top priorities – we are redesigning how pricing on Airbnb works — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) October 10 2022

The Wall Street Journal published a story last month Welcome to Your Airbnb the Cleaning Fees Are $143 and You Still Have to Wash the Linens. The story detailed sometimes-outrageously high cleaning fees that come despite the fact that some hosts have lists of chores for guests to perform before checkout including washing dishes taking out the garbage and “being asked to mow the lawn or feed farm animals.”

“You don’t want to wake up at 6 a.m. to do chores when you’re on vacation” the story quoted a Sacramento California school teacher as saying. “This kind of changes the whole vibe. It’s stressful.”

This reporter was once chastised post-stay by a host for leaving some dishes in the sink to soak instead of washing them and for not placing the pool chairs back into the precise position they were in at the beginning of the stay.

Chesky claimed the way fees get displayed on Airbnb just sort of happened organically over the years.

The way fees are displayed (and how pricing works) didn't go through an intentional design process but occurred organically over the course of years. A lot of lessons learned here — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) October 10 2022

After the press release 17 months ago that Powell had picked a team to review Airbnb’s fee policies the company announced more than a year ago in September 2021 that Powell’s team was conducting a “comprehensive review of our platform” and that Airbnb would begin testing new ways to display pricing that would be more transparent to guests.

“In the coming weeks we will be testing a number of different ways to display pricing that have emerged from this review process” Airbnb stated in September 2021. “As part of this test you will see new pricing explanations and in some cases banners denoting upfront pricing where we have the tests running.”

But the process is apparently ongoing almost a year-and-a-half after the review formally began and Chesky tweeted Monday it’s one of his chief concerns.

A Business Issue Not a Tech Obstacle

It wouldn’t be an overly difficult technical issue for Airbnb to show the total charges in initial search results: It already does so in Europe where the European Commission requires it. Instead it is a business issue.

Airbnb has multiple challenges in revamping the way it displays pricing. First Airbnb wants the nightly rate to be competitive with rivals’ rates in search and elsewhere although currently Airbnb’s pricing isn’t transparent because it doesn’t include service fees charged to guests taxes and cleaning charges.

Let’s be clear: Competitors for the most part outside of Europe likewise aren’t transparent up-front about the final price.

Secondly some hosts view cleaning fees – which have been rising because of a slew of factors including the labor shortage and inflation – as a profit center so Airbnb doesn’t want to alienate hosts. There would be an outcry from hosts if Airbnb limits their ability to set cleaning fees.

Chesky tweeted that Airbnb has numerous potential solutions including a filter that would display all taxes and fees “but we are working on more holistic solutions as well.”

Airbnb declined to elaborate on Chesky’s tweets.

Some of the top travel destinations like Amsterdam London New York and Los Angeles gets the brunt of much of the criticism for the sheer size of their operations. In fact New York reportedly now has more Airbnb locations than actual apartments for rent! That’s insane.

The theory is that Airbnb — and other short-term rental companies like VRBO and HomeAway — are converting long-term rentals that would have housed local residents and families and putting them up on the short-term rental market for visitors thus further decreasing an already short supply of housing.

Some data suggests that this change in the renter’s market can potentially be costing renters thousands of dollars as a result of price pressure. Essentially there are less rentals available therefore the ones that do become available have inflated prices. Supply and demand that is drastically hurting the local residents’ pockets.

It’s a tricky knot to untangle though because there are a lot of factors at play in the market. Outside of New York and its insane imbalance of rentals the rise in local prices as a direct cause of Airbnb seems to hover around only one percentage point. It is known though that converting long-term rentals to short-term rentals shrinks a housing market already experiencing historic shortages. But how much companies like Airbnb directly cause a rise in housing prices is hard to measure.

What is clear is that as discontent grows and cities start to take action we may see a shift in the short-term rental landscape over the next few years. Many cities have already passed restrictions against the short-term rental market ranging from near-total-bans to limits on how long a property can be rented to limits on how many people can get licenses to open an Airbnb. I would expect these kinds of restrictions to continue to get even tighter in the coming years.

""This little cafe in the Latin Quarter of Paris is a marvel"". ""Tips to feel like a real Berliner"". With this type of claim more and more collaborative economy platforms such as Airbnb are contributing to creating and projecting the image of tourist destinations in the digital world.

Paradoxically although with their narrative they try to foster a perception of authenticity of not being a tourist but just another local in reality according to the conclusion of a study led by researchers from the New Perspectives in Tourism and Leisure (NOUTUR) group of the UOC's Economics and Business Studies they take advantage of the identities of destinations and their communities and commodify them without taking into account the needs of the inhabitants of the neighborhoods they advertise. The consequence is that they end up contributing to further overcrowding of already saturated tourist destinations.

""We have seen that Airbnb is one of the most relevant actors today when it comes to attracting tourists to a city. And it achieves this above all through its users and especially the hosts who become prescribers and sell you the image of the neighborhood where you will go which is where the platform has business"" says Lluís Garay a researcher at NOUTUR professor at the UOC's Faculty of Economics and Business and co-author of the study which is published in the International Journal of Tourism Research.

A Big Data Analysis of Airbnb

The NOUTUR group has been studying for years the impact that these online tourism platforms and especially Airbnb have on the cities they advertise. In this new work they focus on analyzing how specifically this platform creates images of tourist destinations. To find out they have applied a methodology they developed in previous work and have analyzed a huge volume of data from more than 24000 descriptions that Airbnb users themselves have made of some 500 urban neighborhoods spread across cities in the northern hemisphere between 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically they dissected the cognitive and affective attributes of destination descriptions and sorted them by category and found that the images of cities projected by Airbnb guides - a series of pages showing the best-known neighborhoods of major tourist destinations often based on comments posted by guests and hosts - are the main authenticity claim to convince tourists to visit a city by becoming a resident.

Bonding Experts

""Airbnb has been particularly astute at using host-created guides with which to build its own narrative about global urban neighborhoods and to forge affective attachments to places"" says Soledad Morales academic director of the university master's degree in Sustainable Tourism and ICT and a member of NOUTUR.

""Under the label of recommendations the company simulates a trusted environment in which owners talk to potential tourists apparently without intervention from the company. But these platforms turn hosts into 'ambassadors' and prescribers of their brand and philosophy as well as the creators of the affective bond with destinations which is the main key for the tourist to revisit the destination in the future"" adds this researcher.

Interestingly Airbnb does not work with guides for all destinations but only for neighborhoods that are in the most visited cities in the world already saturated by tourism. ""It is a colonialist vision it mainly projects the neighborhoods of cities that are among the twenty most visited in the world and geographically located in the global north excluding Africa for example"" highlights Morales.

Stereotyped Images of Destinations

Another of the main results of this study is that much of the image projected of these tourist destinations reproduces stereotyped forms of tourism which homogenizes the cities which tend to have the same stores and establishments in the center.

Likewise one of the results that most surprised the researchers is that Airbnb has not included a single direct reference to safety in its guides or descriptions. On the contrary especially during the pandemic the platform's strategy was to emphasize the reputation of neighborhoods and remind users of the universe of consumption they can access.

More than a complaint say the authors of this work the results of the research should challenge users and hosts but also the platforms to reflect on the role they can play as instigators of tourist awareness. ""Platforms could contribute to making the traveler more aware of the impacts they generate in the destination"" Garay points out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY291cGxlLWJ1aWx0LWFpcmJuYi11bmRlcmdyb3VuZC1ob21lLW5vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLW1vdW50YWluc2lkZS0yMDIyLTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Couple Built Airbnb Home Nestled Into a North Carolina Mountainside,"Mike and Caroline Parrish founded a vacation treehouse community in Asheville North Carolina.

But security experts told SC Media that last week’s attacks on state government sites and today’s DDoS attacks on U.S. airports could be followed by broader more serious attacks.

In a Tweet Monday John Hultquist vice president of intelligence analysis at Mandiant said both the state government and airport attacks ""are what we make of them"" describing DDoS impact superficial and short-lived but highly visible. ""My only concern here is that we may be entering a new phase of increased targeting in the U.S. that might include more serious incidents"" the tweet continued. ""Time will tell.”

The LAX airport said in a statement that FlyLAX.com was partially disrupted early this morning. The service interruption was limited to portions of the public-facing FlyLAX.com website only and no internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions. The information technology team at LAX has restored all services and is investigating the cause.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport added that its atl.com website is now up and running after the DDoS incident. The Atlanta airport said an investigation into the cause of the incident is under way – and at no time were operations at the airport impacted.

LAX also said it notified the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the agency was aware of reports of DDoS attacks targeting multiple U.S. airport websites and is coordinating with potentially-impacted entities and offering assistance as needed.

Ivan Righi senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows pointed out the Killnet asked its supporters to join in on the attacks posting a list of domains to be targeted on its Telegram channel. In total the group mentioned 49 domains belonging to airports all across the country.

Specifically Killnet targeted airports in the following states: Atlanta Alabama Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi and Missouri.

“At this time it's unknown how successful these attacks were” Righi said noting that the attacks began with a DDoS attack on the Chicago O'Hare International Airport where the group stated its motivation to target ‘American's civilian network sector’ which the group deemed to be not secure.

""Killnet's targeting of the United States and its critical sectors is not surprising"" he added. ""The group has been targeting critical sectors in NATO countries since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war and it will likely continue.”

The attacks on the airports were announced by Killnet at 12:50 p.m. CEST or 6:50 a.m. EST on the killnet_reservs Telegram account; that was one hour before the first airport Chicago O’Hare was attacked. Pascal Geenens director of threat intelligence at Radware said only seven minutes after killnet_reservs published the list of targeted U.S. airport websites NoName057(16) created a new invitation only Telegram channel named ‘DDosia Project’ and reposted the list in their newly-created channel.

“It’s important to note that the objective of the attacks was to disrupt the public websites of the airports through DDoS attacks” said Geenens. “There’s no indication that the actors were trying to impact the operations of airports or disrupt air traffic. Disruptions through DDoS attacks are temporary in nature so as soon as the attacks stop access to the websites should recover.”

Alon Nachmany Field CISO AppViewX added that following the attack Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have their websites running through Cloudflare while FlyLAX.com still operated off of an Nginx webserver. There are many vulnerabilities associated with Nginx he added but it and Apache are the most common web servers around. “Both are open-sourced so any patches need to be developed by the community so often these patches take time” Nachmany said.

Most sites that go down from DDoS attacks don't have adequate DDoS resiliency in place said Sean Lyons senior vice president and general manager infrastructure security solutions and services at Akamai. He pointed to three recommendations. First review critical subnets and IP spaces ensuring that they have mitigation controls in place. Second deploy DDoS security controls in an “always-on” mitigation posture as a first layer of defense to avoid an emergency integration scenario and to reduce the burden on incident responders. And third proactively pull together a crisis response team and ensure runbooks and incident response plans are up to date.

CISA issued Alert AA22-110A just six months ago calling Killnet out by name and describing the tactics the group typically uses also warning of similar upcoming attacks after they launched a DDoS attack on Bradley airport in March.

“Today's attack is evidence of the importance of collaborative approaches to cybersecurity and heeding warnings that come from those in the know” said Chris Grove director cyber security at Nozomi Networks. “It’s fortunate that the operations of these airports weren’t impacted but assuredly that will change in the future as the assailants attempt more brazen attacks with larger impact.""

CISA also has an excellent Quick Guide that explains best practices for managing DDoS attacks and good site hygiene to make sure sites are not vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks using various IP protocols.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Nevada lithium facility is ramping up to double its production to meet demand.

""We produce around 5000 tons of lithium per year here today. That equates to about 80000 vehicles"" said Meredith Bandy vice president of investor relations & sustainability. ""We are expanding at 10000 tons per year.""

News 4-Fox 11 was the only Nevada TV station to tour the Silver Peak facility near Tonopah Nevada. The company has locations around the world.

The Silver Peak location was first used for lithium production from brine in 1966 by Foote Mineral Company. Albemarle acquired the site in 2015.

Albemarle's Nevada location is one of the largest producers of lithium in the world and is only one of the lithium and production operations in North America.

""It means we actually start with the raw material the natural resource. We can take it all the way to that salable commercial product "" said Karen Narwold Albemarle’s executive vice president & chief administrative officer.

The company employees 79 to 90 people most of them from the local area near Tonopah. The average yearly salary is $102000.

""I had a buddy who lived out here and told me that the workout here was pretty solid and paid well so I moved out here all the way from Michigan"" said employee Keenan Kinder.

Here's how the lithium extraction works: Very salty brine water is pumped up from 70 wells. It's four times saltier than the ocean and can't be used for drinking water or even irrigation. That brine water contains lithium. The mixture sits in holding ponds as the Nevada sun evaporates the liquid. In 18 to 24 months the concentrated lithium can then be extracted. Lithium is a white powder.

The company produces lithium carbonate at the Nevada facility for industrial use -- things like glass appliances and even soles of running shoes. Other lithium is sent to Albemarle's facility in North Carolina to convert it to lithium hydroxide for batteries.



""In the US Europe and then other parts of Asia for our customer base"" said Bandy.

Blue aqua ponds are spread over a very large area of land on the property. Albemarle said they're very mindful of the environmental impact and said it's minimal.

""We need to produce the lithium the world needs to combat climate change to transition to clean transportation. At the same time we understand we have an environmental footprint that needs to be managed and we take that very seriously"" said Bandy.

The life of the Nevada lithium facility will last another 20 to 30 years. After the company is done with the land it must be restored to it's original state.

In the meantime the company is working on it's footprint by contracting with other companies to recycle the expired batteries and use the lithium for future use. Albemarle is also looking for nontraditional resources like the clay that contains lithium on Nevada's site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvbGl0aGl1bS1taW5pbmctY2xheXRvbi12YWxsZXktbmV2YWRhLWx1bmEtcHVyZS1lbmVyZ3kvMTAyNDMyNDMwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lithium may hold the key to our energy future.

He was 81 and had Parkinson’s disease.

The company’s former chairman and CEO was born in 1940 and grew up in a Philadelphia suburb where his first exposure to real estate came from his father the Wall Street Journal reported. Toll’s father was a real estate broker who bought cheap real estate bonds acquired property and owned apartment buildings during the Depression.

Toll earned an undergraduate degree at Cornell University and a law degree back home at the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1960s. But it didn’t take long for Toll to tire of practicing law in Philadelphia and turn his eyes to real estate.

Toll and his younger brother Bruce co-founded Toll Brothers in 1967 and started by building two model colonial-style homes in suburban Philadelphia. Soon after Toll had contracts to build 20 more homes.

The company’s first homes were worth around $17500 but the brothers were advised by their real estate-savvy father to construct nicer homes that could fetch around $25000. “Those houses today sell for a million dollars” Bruce Toll told the Journal.

The housing development firm went public in 1986 and expanded from the Northeast to the West Coast Southeast Texas and other areas of the country.

Toll who served as the company’s chairman and CEO until 2010 believed that it was the kitchen and master bedroom suite that sold a home. He was known for keeping a pitchfork in the corner of his office to remind people to be careful when buying land Toll Brothers chairman and CEO Doug Yearley told the publication.

Toll would use the Socratic method in staff meetings and advised managers not to travel on Mondays so that they could go over weekend sales and discuss other projects. The Monday meetings would often keep Toll in the office past midnight according to Yearley.

Toll didn’t foresee the significant decline in housing and land prices that began in 2006 after home prices more than doubled in parts of the country during the early 2000s. The company was able to push through the bursting of the bubble in part because of the company’s strong financial position and focus on luxury homes.

Forbes estimated Toll’s net worth at $1.1 billion. He is survived by his wife Jane his brother Bruce five children and 12 grandchildren.

So while brands want to be active in video games on influencer-driven streaming video platforms like Twitch and in metaverse-like online games like Roblox it can be hard for marketers to measure ROI in these spaces.

However there is brand awareness value in being a pioneer in experimental media channels said Raj Pudipeddi chief product and marketing officer and APAC managing director for Align Technology the parent company of Invisalign.

And for Invisalign like with other early-adopter brands the opportunity in new gaming and metaverse channels has more to do with driving awareness than increasing incremental sales.

“Our intent is to create great immersive experiences that will eventually translate to consideration interest and closure” Pudipeddi said.

Awareness first

For the past few years Invisalign has tried to raise its profile among young people by experimenting with ad placements on Twitch and building a network of influencers that swear by its alternative to braces. (After all if you’re going to live in front of a webcam it doesn’t hurt to have a straight smile.)

Although these types of campaigns lack closed-loop measurement capabilities brands should have a general understanding of how brand lift helps drive business outcomes Pudipeddi said.

“We have attribution models from consideration or interest all the way to what happens in a doctor’s office” Pudipeddi said. “A user cannot get Invisalign unless a doctor examines the patient and prescribes the treatment. So you’re trying to initiate that dialogue [with doctors].”

Because Invisalign has studied its awareness-to-adoption pipeline its current focus for emerging media channels is to increase awareness among new audiences Pudipeddi said.

“Seventy percent of patients in the US are still treated with wires and brackets” Pudipeddi said. “We’re focusing on how to maximize engagement and interest because once we do that we have a pretty good idea of what will happen downstream.”

Dental arcade

Invisalign’s latest campaign in the gaming/metaverse space centers on Roblox’s Livetopia role-playing game.

Livetopia now features an Invisalign-branded dentist’s office where gamers can play minigames that emphasize points of differentiation between Invisalign’s product and braces.

In one minigame called The Big Game players must score a touchdown while dodging opponents. The game features two gameplay modes. In Braces mode the opposing team pursues the player avatar more aggressively (to evoke how food particles get stuck to braces). But in Invisalign mode players get a speed boost from “Invisalign Confidence” and it’s much harder for the opposing team to tackle them.

The other game Movie Night places players in a virtual movie theater loaded with snacks and concessions. The point of the game is to eat a set number of snacks but the player can’t eat any of the food on display until they pick up an Invisalign power-up.

Both of these minigames were designed with input from Roblox game developers and Invisalign’s creative partners. When players win either game they collect a virtual coin that can be redeemed for an Invisalign-branded outfit or other virtual goods for their avatar.

Invisalign is also using the relationships it has built with influencers like Charli D’Amelio and Lana Rae to drive audiences to its branded Roblox experience as part of its omnichannel “Drama Free” campaign.

Test and learn

Because gaming-related and metaverse-ish activations and even influencer campaigns are still experimental Pudipeddi said brands should take a “test-and-learn” approach rather than apply their existing playbooks.

“This is a first-ever play for us so we didn’t know what to do from a media reach and frequency standpoint” Pudipeddi said. “We said ‘First let’s create an experience that’s interesting and engaging. And then we’ll learn from it.’”

Invisalign has already taken a few lessons from its early forays into gaming and the metaverse Pudipeddi said. “You have to stay focused on your points of differentiation and the key messages you want to deliver” he said.

And by experimenting with different gameplay experiences Invisalign is learning what resonates better with its target audience. For example the Movie Night minigame seems to be attracting more interest from players so the brand is working with its game developers to understand why Pudipeddi said.

By emphasizing points of differentiation between its product and braces through immersive gameplay experiences and influencer testimonials Invisalign hopes to plant a seed of awareness that could grow into consideration and eventually a purchase. But Pudipeddi said closed-loop attribution and ROI tracking metrics are not immediate priorities.

“It’s more a question of charting new waters” he said. “Is this truly incremental? We’ll find that out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZGVudGlzdHJ5LmNvLnVrLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvYWxpZ24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LWludmlzYWxpZ24tcGFja2FnZS1mb3ItY29ycmVjdGluZy1tYWxvY2NsdXNpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Align announces Invisalign package for malocclusions - Dentistry,"10 October 2022

Align Technology has introduced Invisalign Moderate package a treatment for doctors to correct mild-to-moderate malocclusions.

Align Technology has announced that the Invisalign Moderate package will be launched in the UK and Ireland later this year.

Doctors can consider it as an option for patients for whom the Invisalign Comprehensive package is more than what is clinically required. ​

Three key elements

The Invisalign Moderate package is a maximum 20-stage clear aligner treatment option within the Invisalign system product portfolio.

It is designed for doctors to treat mild-to-moderate indications such as crowding and spacing anterior posterior issues and vertical discrepancies.

The Invisalign Moderate package includes the three key elements that power the Invisalign system:

Smartstage technology to program each tooth movement in a certain sequence at the right time to achieve greater outcomes and treatment predictability Smarttrack material Align’s own patented aligner material that provides gentle more constant forces to improve control of tooth movements Smartforce features attachments and features designed into the aligners deliver the precise forces when needed to achieve more predictable tooth movements.

The Invisalign Moderate package also includes customisable options such as compliance indicators precision cuts bite ramps and interproximal reduction (IPR) such as the Invisalign Comprehensive package only with fewer stages as the treatment can be completed in five to 12 months on average.

An essential part

Markus Sebastian executive vice president and managing director EMEA at Align Technology commented: ‘Mild-to-moderate malocclusions are among the most prevalent in the general population.

‘Thanks to the Invisalign Moderate package Invisalign trained doctors will be able to offer more treatment options to their patients.

‘It provides greater flexibility to help doctors tailor their treatment based on the unique needs of their patients.’

Lee Taylor vice president marketing EMEA at Align said: ‘The addition of the Invisalign Moderate package can benefit patients who were under the impression that they were not eligible for an Invisalign treatment.

‘It is an essential part of the Invisalign portfolio between Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Comprehensive.’

Invisalign Moderate was launched as pilot program in 2020.

Dr Sinem Ceylanoglu who partipcated in the pilot commented: ‘I have been using the Invisalign Moderate package for two years and it works very well with patients.

‘In some restorative cases for adults that require a relatively short treatment of 16-18 to 20 aligners this is a very good option to get patients engaged and compliant.

‘Teens are also good candidates for the Invisalign Moderate’ package: they feel motivated by the shorter duration of the treatment and stick to it more easily.’

The Invisalign Moderate package will be available in the UKI France Italy Germany Portugal and Spain later this year.

Investors learn how you can back Health Transformers through the StartUp Health Moonshots Impact Fund.

StartUp Health is proud to introduce our next Impact Board member Sue Siegel. Most recently as Chief Innovation Officer at GE and CEO of GE Ventures & Healthymagination Siegel focused on growth and innovation initiatives. She has been a longtime health warrior for a variety of different causes and hopes to use her experience in mentorship to empower Health Transformers at StartUp Health.

Q&A

Can you tell us what your current role is and what projects you are working on?

I serve on the boards of Illumina Align Technology Nevro and Bakar BioEnginuity Hub. I am a Trustee of the Kaiser Family Foundation and Chair of the Board of MIT’s The Engine an accelerator for tough tech startups. I teach at MIT’s Sloan School of Management and I do advisory and mentorship work.

During my 30-plus years in the workforce I have had the privilege of learning at a variety of excellent companies such as Bio-Rad DuPont and Amersham. I had the opportunity to lead Affymetrix a young genomics company through an explosive growth phase that helped shape the evolution of the burgeoning genomics industry — a heady entrepreneurial experience. That led me to become a general partner at a leading investment fund in Silicon Valley investing in precision and digital health companies. Then I joined GE to continue my innovation learning. Throughout all of that I loved helping others on their growth journeys and now I look forward to dedicating some energy to helping entrepreneurs develop as they scale their exciting innovative companies.

What do you feel has been a throughline for your professional narrative?

There are two things. One is the pursuit and absolute love of innovation. I so enjoy learning about “the next new thing” — and sometimes helping to bring it to fruition. That involves a mix of incredible highs and lows lots of risk-taking and trying one’s best to be patient (not as we know a common attribute among entrepreneurs).

The second is engaged leadership and developing people to help them reach their potential. That has brought me more joy than I can tell you. Watching new leaders grow through their toughest challenges supporting their efforts to shape a solution and go after it and celebrating their successes — love that!

What goes into being an effective mentor?

I’ll share what I’ve learned over time: Mentorship involves listening carefully to what the mentee’s challenges and motivations might be. Sometimes those are hard to discern because an entrepreneur is facing so much at once. Good mentors share hard realities tell mentees things that others won’t and help them think through and clarify priorities. Too often if they’re CEOs or founders people tell them what they think they want to hear. A true partner will give them perspectives on their impact — how their decisions impact others and how their presence is felt across their ecosystem. Additionally mentors focus on their mentee’s leadership development and personal growth.

What does it take in the real world to affect change in health? What kinds of innovations truly move the needle in healthcare?

Healthcare is such an important field. It impacts everyone. But true impact in healthcare takes patience. Getting any particular innovation to become part of the standard of care certainly does.

I’ve had the privilege of participating in a whole new industry as it was being created: genomics which I’ll use as an example. The human genome was actively being sequenced in the late 1980s and 1990s; it’s been about 40 years since that started and the first draft only came in the year 2000. Because we were unlocking our molecular basis our code we all hoped it would cure disease more quickly. Well it’s taken a bit longer than we expected but over the last few years there has been a plethora of new diagnostics and therapeutics. The world of precision health is no longer just a dream it has become reality. And we have only just begun.

What’s needed now is to bring convergent expertise to the table: development regulatory policy and reimbursement strategy to name a few. For the problems these moonshot entrepreneurs are attacking their brilliance grit time and investment — plus the strong teams they are building — will all be needed in order to make it happen.

You’re a very busy person and could be involved in any initiative. Why join the StartUp Health Impact Board and support StartUp Health’s global army of entrepreneurs?

It always comes down to people. People are what makes the difference. When I met Steve Krein and Unity Stoakes I immediately knew they were strong entrepreneurs. They were on a mission to create impact and value. They had this vision that I thought was crazy at the time but they have systematically put the foundation in place and have proceeded to build up each of the moonshots. I’ve admired how they have built the StartUp Health team and brought in high-quality leaders advisors and incredible entrepreneurs. It’s great to be able to participate and contribute.

Is there an area of health and innovation where you feel like there’s a gap in innovation? Or do you see great potential for opportunity?

Within the StartUp Health context that’s like asking who’s your favorite kid! The reality is that all StartUp Health moonshots are important. Thank goodness all that power of entrepreneurial talent is being focused on them.

But if there’s one area of extraordinary need it’s the world of mental health especially Alzheimer’s. With the evolving world demographics and the prevalence of Alzheimer’s increasing at an unprecedented rate we need solutions urgently. To stand a chance against this debilitating scourge we need the kind of risk-taking “we can conquer anything” attitude that entrepreneurs bring. I’m thankful that the StartUp Health crew had the courage to pick it as a moonshot.

A lot of our entrepreneurs are struggling week to week and it can be very challenging. Can you offer any words of wisdom about thinking long term?

I’ve been there! Having run companies at different phases of evolution I understand the challenges these leaders face day to day. One thing I learned is that leaders should welcome the insights of trusted partners those they can turn to help them think through the long term who they can ask to share their perspectives. Partners who can ask the right questions like: What are you not thinking about because you’re so deep into your issue du jour? What have others come up against along their growth journeys — and how have they overcome each hurdle? What talent is needed to achieve your vision? What personal development areas could you work on that could accelerate your company’s growth? How should you think about your financing strategy for the long term?

This is what I want to tell entrepreneurs: Engaging with a couple of experienced partners can help you and your company grow help you prioritize your efforts to achieve your long-term vision and help prepare you and your team for the road ahead.

With everything going on in your life how do you make sure you stay grounded?

Hmm. Along the way I’ve learned that there are a few things I need to do:

prioritize time with my husband sons extended family and friends

ensure I’m learning in all that I do

incorporate healthy habits like hiking as much as I can

find ways to collapse categories like hiking while offering mentorship

laugh as often as possible!

And finally there are a couple of things I tell colleagues that I’m lucky enough to mentor to be mindful of — and that I strive to follow myself:

seek impact not glory

assume noble intent

Those are some ways I use to try to stay grounded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2RlbnRhbC1icmFjZXMtbWFya2V0LXNpemUtdG8tZ3Jvdy1ieS11c2QtMS04NS1ibi1nbG9iYWwtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1zdXBwbGllcy1tYXJrZXQtdG8tYmUtcGFyZW50LW1hcmtldC0tLXRlY2huYXZpby0zMDE2NDM2NDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dental Braces Market Size to Grow by USD 1.85 Bn Global Healthcare Supplies Market to be Parent Market - Technavio,"NEW YORK Oct. 10 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The global dental braces market has been categorized as a part of the global healthcare supplies market.

Coming in at a lower price than than the company's flagship handset the Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) costs $600.

The 6.4-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display has a 120Hz refresh rate 240Hz touch response and an optical fingerprint scanner.

NEW ORLEANS – The Manning Award sponsored by the Allstate Sugar Bowl has named eight quarterbacks as its “Stars of the Week.” College football fans can now go to the Allstate Sugar Bowl Facebook page to vote for what they think was the best performance from this past weekend. When voting closes on Thursday at 11 a.m. (Central) the top vote-getter will be announced as the Manning Award Quarterback of the Week.

VOTE HERE!

The Manning Award was created by the Allstate Sugar Bowl in 2004 to honor the college football accomplishments of Archie Peyton and Eli Manning. It is the only quarterback award that includes the candidates’ bowl performances in its balloting. Since the Manning Award started recognizing Stars of the Week in 2011 464 different quarterbacks from 129 schools have been recognized. Sixty-seven players from 66 different schools were honored during the 2021 season.

This week’s eight Manning Award Stars of the Week are:

Trenton Bourguet Arizona State (15-of-21 182 yards 3 TDs 1 INT QBR: 93.9)

Bourguet a former walk-on comes off the bench for the first significant action of his career and tosses three touchdown passes including the go-ahead delivery in the fourth quarter as the Sun Devils shock No. 21 Washington 45-38 in Pac-12 play.

Todd Centeio James Madison (28-of-37 394 yards 4 TDs 0 INT QBR: 82.2)

Centeio tallies his season-best for passing yards completions and attempts as he connects on a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns to lift the undefeated Dukes into the AP Top 25 for the first time in history with a 42-20 Sun Belt road win over Arkansas State.

Max Duggan TCU (23-of-33 308 yards 3 TDs 1 INT QBR: 83.8)

Duggan who also runs for 55 yards and a touchdown throws three second-half touchdowns including the game-winning 24-yard TD connection with 1:36 to go as TCU takes down No. 19 Kansas 38-31 in a Big 12 road game.

Quinn Ewers Texas (21-of-31 289 yards 4 TDs 1 INT QBR: 92.3)

Ewers returns after missing three games due to injury and tallies career-highs in nearly every category as he leads the Longhorns to a 49-0 crushing of archrival Oklahoma in a Big 12 showdown.

C.J. Stroud Ohio State (21-of-26 361 yards 6 TDs 1 INT QBR: 97.9)

Stroud ties the school record for single-game touchdown passes – his third time with six in a game to set a Big Ten record – as he leads the Buckeyes to a 49-20 Big Ten blowout of Michigan State on the road.

Dorian Thompson-Robinson UCLA (18-of-23 299 yards 4 TDs 1 INT QBR: 94.9)

Thompson-Robinson who also runs for a touchdown connects on a 70-yard TD hook-up in the fourth quarter to help the undefeated Bruins pull away from No. 11 Utah in a critical 42-32 Pac-12 victory.

Clayton Tune Houston (36-of-57 366 yards 3 TDs 1 INT QBR: 69.6)

Tune connects on two touchdown passes in the final 1:17 as the Cougars erase a 19-point fourth-quarter deficit in a thrilling 33-32 AAC road win over Memphis.

Kurtis Rourke Ohio (24-of-27 427 yards 3 TDs 0 INT QBR: 95.4)

Rourke who notches his fourth 300-yard game of the season connects on a pair of third-quarter touchdowns to break open the Bobcats MAC showdown with Akron in a 55-34 win.

While the Manning Award selected 30 quarterbacks for its preseason Watch List additional quarterbacks are expected to be added to the Watch List later in the season. Ten finalists will be selected and the winner is scheduled to be announced following the College Football Playoff National Championship.

In its first 18 years the Manning Award has recognized the top names in college football. It has honored quarterbacks from 13 different schools and from four different conferences. The Southeastern Conference (Bryce Young Joe Burrow Mac Jones Johnny Manziel Cam Newton JaMarcus Russell and Tim Tebow) leads the way with seven Manning Award honorees while the Big 12 Conference (Kyler Murray Baker Mayfield Vince Young Colt McCoy and Robert Griffin III) has had five winners. The Atlantic Coast Conference (Deshaun Watson twice Matt Ryan and Jameis Winston) has had four Manning Award winners. Alabama (Bryce Young and Jones) joins LSU (Burrow and Russell) Oklahoma (Murray and Mayfield) and Texas (McCoy and Vince Young) as the only schools with two different winners.

All the Manning Award winners follow in the footsteps of the Mannings themselves. In college Archie Peyton and Eli Manning combined for over 25000 passing yards and 201 touchdowns while playing in 10 bowl games and earning four bowl MVP awards. Archie was the No. 2 pick in the NFL Draft while both Peyton and Eli were selected No. 1 overall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9taWtlLWd1bmR5LXJldmVhbHMtaGUtb25jZS1pbnRlcnZpZXdlZC1mb3ItYS1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWpvYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mike Gundy Reveals He Once Interviewed For A Surprising Job,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/college-football/mike-gundy-reveals-he-once-interviewed-for-a-surprising-job on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9taWtlLWd1bmR5LXJldmVhbHMtaGUtb25jZS1pbnRlcnZpZXdlZC1mb3ItYS1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWpvYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The Alphabet Workers Union whose members include both direct employees and subcontracted staff for Google’s parent company claims that two workers at a data center in Council Bluffs Iowa were terminated for discussing their working conditions and because of their affiliation with the labor organization according to documents viewed by Bloomberg.

Another worker at the site faced retaliation for having a role in the union according to the complaint which was filed on Wednesday against Google and Modis an information-technology firm that serves as a subcontractor.

Labor groups have been pushing to make inroads this year in big tech companies long seen as resistant to union organizing. In addition to Google Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. have faced labor campaigns in recent months -- with mixed results.

In another complaint filed with the NLRB on Wednesday two contract security guards working at Google data centers in North and South Carolina allege that they lost their security clearances after discussing working conditions. The workers said they had spoken out about a lack of benefits such as sick days and parental leave and have been unable to work without their security clearances.

The cases appear to be the first in which Alphabet Inc. workers were fired for their union membership according to Parul Koul a Google software engineer and the executive chair of AWU a so-called minority union that doesn’t have collective bargaining authority but advocates on behalf of workers. Google is named in the complaints as a “joint employer” or a company with sufficient control over a group of workers to be legally liable for their treatment.

Google didn’t have an immediate comment. Modis which is owned by Adecco Group AG didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Claims filed with the NLRB are investigated by regional officials. If they find merit in the allegations and can’t secure a settlement they issue a complaint on behalf of the labor board’s general counsel which is considered by an agency judge. Those judges’ rulings can be appealed to the NLRB members in Washington and then to federal court.

The agency has the authority to order companies to reinstate fired workers and change policies but generally can’t hold executives personally liable for alleged wrongdoing or issue any punitive damages.

Last year another NLRB complaint filed by AWU on behalf of a subcontracted Google data-center worker in South Carolina led to a settlement. As part of that agreement the tech giant promised to obey federal law by not silencing workers about their pay.

The treatment of the workers in Council Bluffs violates that settlement AWU alleges. In June one of the workers Eli Cave who uses they and them pronouns suggested a walkout to protest a new timekeeping system that they feared could lead to lost wages. Shortly thereafter a manager said Cave’s actions “could be considered insubordination” and threatened to put Cave on a performance improvement plan according to a statement of facts in the case viewed by Bloomberg.

In July two other workers at the site Dustin Sommers-Hehn and Leilani Morton met in the data center’s common area to discuss working conditions according to the statement of facts. Later that week management gave Sommers-Hehn a “final warning” for having a “union meeting” and told Morton that discussing unions was forbidden the document states. Sommers-Hehn and Morton learned in August and October respectively that their contracts wouldn’t be renewed.

The other complaint filed Wednesday is tied to security guards at Google contractor Allied Universal. Earlier this year Allied workers realized they weren’t receiving key benefits such as sick days special leave for Covid-19 and parental leave though they were guaranteed under Google’s minimum benefits standards for US contractors according to the complaint.

Allied rolled out some benefits in September after a petition circulated by employees attracted hundreds of signatures workers said. Cynthia West who was working as a security guard in North Carolina said she helped organize the petition but she feels she has paid a steep price. Shortly after accepting a new job at another Google contractor on the site she learned that she had lost her security clearance.

A representative for Allied didn’t have an immediate comment.

Although she was employed by Google’s contracting firms West said that the client bears responsibility for working conditions on the site.

“The client does or should have some culpability for that” said West 37 who is cited by the AWU complaint. “If they don’t know they need to know.”

Another worker who is part of the complaint against Google and Allied Heather Smith said she had spoken out about the lack of benefits and also advocated on behalf of a pregnant colleague.

In late September she learned she had lost her security clearance. “It was a blow out of nowhere” said Smith 31. “I was terminated without them actually saying ‘terminated.’”

The tough year-over-year comparisons currency headwinds and moderation in ad growth remained a drag. However Monness analyst Brian White maintains a Buy recommendation on GOOGL stock as the company’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. Moreover his price target of $145 represents 46.9% upside potential.

White said that the internet giant is poised to gain from “long-term digital ad trend.” Further the “shift of workloads to the cloud and benefit from digital transformation” will accelerate its growth.

Alphabet’s continued investments in AI (artificial intelligence) cloud and search provide a solid base for long-term growth. Meanwhile growing deal volume in the cloud business and large addressable market will support its growth.

While Alphabet’s long-term prospects remain solid White is skeptical about regulatory headwinds. For instance TipRanks’ data shows that GOOGL stock’s legal & regulatory risks account for 22.6% of its total risks. Further its legal & regulatory risks are higher than the sector average of 20.2%.

Is GOOGL Stock a Buy Hold or Sell?

On TipRanks Alphabet stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys and two Hold recommendations. Further analysts’ average price target of $142.16 implies 44.1% upside potential.

While analysts are bullish about GOOGL’s prospects hedge funds have a negative outlook. Hedge funds sold 132.1 million GOOGL shares last quarter. Further Alphabet stock has a Neutral Smart Score of 6 out of 10 on TipRanks.

Conclusion

The ongoing macro headwinds impacting advertising spending adverse currency movement and pressure on near-term earnings could restrict the upside in GOOGL stock. However momentum in its cloud business strength in google search digital transformation growing engagement in short-form YouTube videos and recovery in ad spending will support its long-term growth.

Before we can connect people to timely information and resources we need to understand their intent when they turn to Search. Earlier this year we shared our goal to automatically and more accurately detect personal crisis searches on Google Search with the help of AI. This week we’re rolling out this capability across the globe. This change enables us to better understand if someone is in crisis then present them with reliable actionable information. Over the coming months we’ll work with partners to identify national suicide hotlines and make these resources accessible in dozens more languages.

Beyond the immediate needs related to mental health crises people want information along their mental health journey no matter what it looks like — including content that can help them connect with others with similar experiences. To better support these needs YouTube recently launched its Personal Stories feature which surfaces content from creators who share personal experiences and stories about health topics including anxiety depression post-traumatic stress disorder addiction bipolar disease schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

After looking at the best cheap micro-cap and mid-cap stocks out there let’s turn our attention to cheap blue-chip stocks.

Typically blue chips or shares in venerable well-established companies aren’t cheap. That’s not to say they are usually overvalued or that investing in blue-chips results in subpar returns if you do not buy them at a discount.

As the famous Warren Buffett quote goes “it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But what if you can buy a “wonderful company” at a more-than-fair price? There may be the opportunity for even more substantial long-term returns. First market conditions normalize resulting in discounted blue chips returning to fair prices. Then steady gains from price appreciation and dividends over a longer timeframe.

So what are the best cheap blue-chip stocks out there today? Consider these seven each a high-quality business currently trading at a low valuation.

BTI British American Tobacco PLC $36.81 GOOG GOOGL Alphabet $99.57 $98.68 IBM IBM $118.82 JPM JPMorgan Chase & Co. $105.98 PFE Pfizer $42.32 VZ Verizon Communications $36.85 XOM ExonnMobil $101.03

British American Tobacco PLC (BTI)

Blue-chip tobacco stocks like British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI) trade at low valuations even in a bull market. This of course is due to the industry’s cash cow product cigarettes being in secular decline. There is high uncertainty as to whether “big tobacco” can still thrive in a post-cigarette future.

Yet recently BTI stock has fallen to a meager price. Today you can buy this global tobacco giant (whose brands include Camel and Newport) for only 8.1x forward earnings. Besides being cheaper than the overall market BTI is also cheaper than peer Altria Group (NYSE:MO) which trades for around 8.6x forward earnings.

Not only that unlike Altria which lost billions on its Juul Labs investment British American Tobacco has demonstrated success in diversifying its product mix beyond cigarettes. This may leave it well-positioned to maintain (and grow) its high-yield dividend of 7.99%.

Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL)

It may be a relatively young company and may not pay a dividend but it’s apt to say Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a blue-chip stock. This is due to several factors including a deep economic moat high operating margins and a strong balance sheet.

Story continues

You may agree that GOOG stock is a blue-chip yet disagree that it’s one of the cheap blue-chip stocks. I’ll agree with you that this stock is not “undervalued” on an absolute basis as it trades for 18.8x earnings in-line with major indices like the S&P 500

However Alphabet’s current earnings multiple may overestimate how long its main digital ads business remains in a slump and underestimate the company’s potential to re-accelerate earnings growth. Shares have strong rebound potential once the digital ad market recovers and Alphabet’s other growth catalysts start to play out.

IBM (IBM)

While Alphabet is an ascending tech blue-chip IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a blue-chip tech “dinosaur.” At least that’s still the market’s perception of this more than century-old technology company.

Trading for 19.3x earnings and with a forward dividend yield of 5.44% critics of this stock will warn you that it’s a value trap and possibly a yield trap. Yet despite the poor performance of “Big Blue” over the past decade (down nearly 38.5%) the next ten years could be much more stellar for IBM stock investors.

Why? Chalk it up to its in-progress transformation into primarily a hybrid cloud computing company. Through bolt-on acquisitions IBM continues to bulk up its presence in the hybrid cloud space. Steadily helping it become a faster-growing company this could result in a move to substantially higher prices for IBM stock in the coming years.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)

As InvestorPlace’s Joel Baglole recently discussed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been hammered by the market’s worries about a recession. These worries have outweighed the tailwind for this banking giant which is the sharp rise in interest rates which points to increased profitability.

However one can argue that these recession worries are already fully-factored into the valuation of JPM stock. Shares in the money center bank currently trade for 9.7x the estimated 2022 earnings. However this valuation doesn’t look at first glance as a big discount towards the low end of its valuation over the past five years.

If JPMorgan Chase can weather today’s economic storms and capitalize on the current rising rate environment future operating results could be stronger-than-expected. One bank stock analyst (Citi’s Keith Horowitz) anticipates this. A series of earnings beats could enable JPM to rise on a re-rating.

Pfizer (PFE)

If searching for cheap blue-chip stocks on a screener chances are one of the first ones you’ll find is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The pharmaceutical giant trades at a super-low valuation (only 8.28x earnings) although there is a caveat.

You can say earnings in 2021 and 2022 were “boosted” by the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine which the company co-developed with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX). With the vaccination wave long since passed Pfizer’s earnings are set to drop.

However even with an expected drop in earnings per share (or EPS) from $6.49 to $5.09 next year PFE stock is still cheap. Based on next year’s estimates Pfizer trades for 8.5x earnings. There may be room for shares to move higher towards a valuation on par with other pharma stocks. Pfizer’s peers trade at a valuation closer to ten times earnings.

Verizon Communications (VZ)

Rising interest rates have put pressure on telecom stocks which investors buy mainly for their high dividends. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) may not be as popular as AT&T (NYSE:T) among dividend investors yet this factor has pushed this “Baby Bell” nearly 28% lower year-to-date.

If rates keep rising VZ stock will likely slide lower. However if you’re bullish rates aren’t going much higher from here and are looking to scoop up dividend stocks at attractive valuations now may be the time to buy.

Verizon’s forward dividend yield currently comes in at around 7.08%. That’s only slightly less than AT&T’s current forward yield around 7.43%. Not only that as I’ve argued previously VZ beats T stock in areas like dividend coverage and dividend growth. Trading for only 7.4x earnings while higher than AT&T’s current multiple of 5.6x VZ is cheap even among cheap blue-chip stocks.

ExxonMobil (XOM)

Up until the start of this month ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) like other oil stocks was pulling back. This was in tandem with the slide in crude oil prices due to concerns that a recession-driven drop in demand would outweigh the impact to supply caused by Russia’s Ukraine invasion and subsequent sanctions.

However so far in October oil (and XOM stock) have started to bounce back. Hopes of oil prices “returning to normal” have been dashed as OPEC and its allies have agreed to production cuts. This could counter any impact on demand from a recession enabling prices to stay high.

In turn enabling ExxonMobil’s current level of profitability to continue. Currently trading at a discounted valuation of 11x earnings in anticipation of a drop in oil prices XOM could move higher due to multiple expansions. The company’s capital allocation plan may also help move the needle over a longer timeframe.

The cases appear to be the first in which Alphabet Inc. workers were fired for their union membership according to Parul Koul a Google software engineer and the executive chair of AWU a so-called minority union that doesn’t have collective bargaining authority but advocates on behalf of workers. Google is named in the complaints as a “joint employer” or a company with sufficient control over a group of workers to be legally liable for their treatment.

Google didn’t have an immediate comment. Modis which is owned by Adecco Group AG didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Claims filed with the NLRB are investigated by regional officials. If they find merit in the allegations and can’t secure a settlement they issue a complaint on behalf of the labor board’s general counsel which is considered by an agency judge. Those judges’ rulings can be appealed to the NLRB members in Washington and then to federal court.

The agency has the authority to order companies to reinstate fired workers and change policies but generally can’t hold executives personally liable for alleged wrongdoing or issue any punitive damages.

Last year another NLRB complaint filed by AWU on behalf of a subcontracted Google data-center worker in South Carolina led to a settlement. As part of that agreement the tech giant promised to obey federal law by not silencing workers about their pay.

The treatment of the workers in Council Bluffs violates that settlement AWU alleges. In June one of the workers Eli Cave who uses they and them pronouns suggested a walkout to protest a new timekeeping system that they feared could lead to lost wages. Shortly thereafter a manager said Cave’s actions “could be considered insubordination” and threatened to put Cave on a performance improvement plan according to a statement of facts in the case viewed by Bloomberg.

In July two other workers at the site Dustin Sommers-Hehn and Leilani Morton met in the data center’s common area to discuss working conditions according to the statement of facts. Later that week management gave Sommers-Hehn a “final warning” for having a “union meeting” and told Morton that discussing unions was forbidden the document states. Sommers-Hehn and Morton learned in August and October respectively that their contracts wouldn’t be renewed.

The other complaint filed Wednesday is tied to security guards at Google contractor Allied Universal. Earlier this year Allied workers realized they weren’t receiving key benefits such as sick days special leave for Covid-19 and parental leave though they were guaranteed under Google’s minimum benefits standards for US contractors according to the complaint.

Allied rolled out some benefits in September after a petition circulated by employees attracted hundreds of signatures workers said. Cynthia West who was working as a security guard in North Carolina said she helped organize the petition but she feels she has paid a steep price. Shortly after accepting a new job at another Google contractor on the site she learned that she had lost her security clearance.

A representative for Allied didn’t have an immediate comment.

Although she was employed by Google’s contracting firms West said that the client bears responsibility for working conditions on the site.

“The client does or should have some culpability for that” said West 37 who is cited by the AWU complaint. “If they don’t know they need to know.”

Another worker who is part of the complaint against Google and Allied Heather Smith said she had spoken out about the lack of benefits and also advocated on behalf of a pregnant colleague.

In late September she learned she had lost her security clearance. “It was a blow out of nowhere” said Smith 31. “I was terminated without them actually saying ‘terminated.’”

The tough year-over-year comparisons currency headwinds and moderation in ad growth remained a drag. However Monness analyst Brian White maintains a Buy recommendation on GOOGL stock as the company’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. Moreover his price target of $145 represents 46.9% upside potential.

White said that the internet giant is poised to gain from “long-term digital ad trend.” Further the “shift of workloads to the cloud and benefit from digital transformation” will accelerate its growth.

Alphabet’s continued investments in AI (artificial intelligence) cloud and search provide a solid base for long-term growth. Meanwhile growing deal volume in the cloud business and large addressable market will support its growth.

While Alphabet’s long-term prospects remain solid White is skeptical about regulatory headwinds. For instance TipRanks’ data shows that GOOGL stock’s legal & regulatory risks account for 22.6% of its total risks. Further its legal & regulatory risks are higher than the sector average of 20.2%.

Is GOOGL Stock a Buy Hold or Sell?

On TipRanks Alphabet stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys and two Hold recommendations. Further analysts’ average price target of $142.16 implies 44.1% upside potential.

While analysts are bullish about GOOGL’s prospects hedge funds have a negative outlook. Hedge funds sold 132.1 million GOOGL shares last quarter. Further Alphabet stock has a Neutral Smart Score of 6 out of 10 on TipRanks.

Conclusion

The ongoing macro headwinds impacting advertising spending adverse currency movement and pressure on near-term earnings could restrict the upside in GOOGL stock. However momentum in its cloud business strength in google search digital transformation growing engagement in short-form YouTube videos and recovery in ad spending will support its long-term growth.

Before we can connect people to timely information and resources we need to understand their intent when they turn to Search. Earlier this year we shared our goal to automatically and more accurately detect personal crisis searches on Google Search with the help of AI. This week we’re rolling out this capability across the globe. This change enables us to better understand if someone is in crisis then present them with reliable actionable information. Over the coming months we’ll work with partners to identify national suicide hotlines and make these resources accessible in dozens more languages.

Beyond the immediate needs related to mental health crises people want information along their mental health journey no matter what it looks like — including content that can help them connect with others with similar experiences. To better support these needs YouTube recently launched its Personal Stories feature which surfaces content from creators who share personal experiences and stories about health topics including anxiety depression post-traumatic stress disorder addiction bipolar disease schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Or follow us on Google News

In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg News republished by Autoblog George Hotz the serial entrepreneur who founded self-driving startup Comma.ai has this to say about autonomous cars: “It’s a scam. These companies have squandered tens of billions of dollars.” In 2018 analysts put the market value of Waymo LLC then a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. at $175 billion. Its most recent funding round gave the company an estimated valuation of $30 billion.

The definitive book on the effort to bring autonomous cars to market is Autonomy written by Lawrence Burns who headed the early efforts by Google to develop the technology. It’s a fascinating tale filled with multiple twists and turns as the team struggled to find the answer to cars that drive themselves.

But despite all the money thrown at the problem by Google Uber Tesla Zoox Cruise and countless others autonomous cars are no closer to reality today than they were 5 years ago and many of those companies are running for the exits looking to cut their losses if they can.

Anthony Levandowski was part of the team at Google headed by Lawrence Burns. For a decade he was one of the brightest stars in the field of autonomous driving before he disgraced himself by suddenly quitting his job at Waymo and jumping to Uber. What followed was a giant lawsuit between Waymo and Uber and several convictions for stealing trade secrets for Levandowski. Ultimately he was pardoned by Donald Trump at the urging of Peter Thiel. Now he’s running a startup that is developing autonomous trucks for industrial sites. Levandowski says for the foreseeable future that’s about as much complexity as any driverless vehicle will be able to handle. “You’d be hard pressed to find another industry that’s invested so many dollars in R&D and that has delivered so little. Forget about profits — what’s the combined revenue of all the robo-taxi robo-truck robo-whatever companies? Is it a million dollars? Maybe. I think it’s more like zero.”

Tesla of course has played a big role in the self-driving world first with its Autopilot technology and later with something it bills as “Full Self Driving” a now $15000 add-on that our own Fritz Hasler says is not worth the money even in its latest iteration that was just released by Tesla. The company has done a number of zigs and zags of its own over the years publicly breaking with Mobileye and its camera-based system to embrace radar. Now it has transitioned away from radar and gone back to emphasizing cameras again. The only thing it won’t do is use lidar because CEO Musk sees it as unnecessary and costly. He probably also doesn’t want his car crapped up with ugly bumps and bubbles and who can blame him? Teslas are blessed with timeless designs thanks to Franz Von Holzhausen. Adding lidar would ruin their appearance.

A favorite industry myth is that humans are terrible drivers but it’s not even close to true says Bloomberg. Throw a top-of-the-line robot at any difficult driving task and you’ll be lucky if the robot lasts a few seconds before crapping out. “Humans are really really good drivers — absurdly good” George Hotz says.

Fatal accidents are largely caused by reckless behavior — speeding drunks texters and people who fall asleep at the wheel. Although most of the accidents reported by self-driving cars have been minor the data suggests that autonomous cars have been involved in accidents more frequently than cars driven by humans with rear-end collisions being especially common. “The problem is that there isn’t any test to know if a driverless car is safe to operate” says Ramsey an analyst at Gartner a market research firm. “It’s mostly just anecdotal.”

Connected Cars May Be The Answer

Much of the hype and hoopla about autonomous cars is focused on how they will make driving safer. There’s no question that people kill themselves and others at an alarming rate while driving. The World Health Organization says about 1.3 million people die from traffic-related injuries each year. And yet if you study that last paragraph the primary causes of road deaths are factors that impair the ability of drivers to do what they usually do quite well — excessive speed intoxication texting or falling asleep at the wheel.

According to the New York Times there is a new technology coming available that could address many of those human failings. It is called C-V2X which stands for cellular vehicle–to–everything technology. It allows vehicles to communicate with each other and with the surrounding environment which could reduce collisions considerably.

With V2X technology a car whose sensors or cameras detect a pothole in the roadway will be able to notify their drivers giving them time to take evasive maneuvers. Highway workers will be alerted to an oncoming vehicle that’s traveling too close to them. School bus drivers will be warned against letting children off if a vehicle fails to stop. Bicyclists and drivers will be made aware of each other before possible collisions.

“While passive safety such as seat belts and active safety from such things as lane departure warning has improved occupant safety fatalities outside the vehicle are growing” said Anupam Malhotra senior director of connected services for Audi of America. “We’re now working to provide cooperative safety sharing safety-related information with others.”

Audi is working with bicycle and equipment manufacturers to offer V2X transponders for cyclists and expects to begin offering V2X in its 2025 model year vehicles. “We’re currently including V2X in the development of our vehicle architecture as we can’t wait and we need to be ready” said Mark Dahncke Audi of America’s director of product communications. Ford is working on something similar.

Connected cars will use LTE cellular technology to communicate with each other directly. Eventually the system will switch to 5G standards allowing for faster communication. Pedestrians bicyclists highway workers and emergency vehicles will all be able to be part of the communication network. Best of all the technology is expected to be inexpensive costing manufacturers much less than lidar sensors and mobile supercomputers that autonomous cars rely on.

The Takeaway

V2X systems hold great promise but the focus needs to be on getting drunks texters and speeders off the road. The ability to detect someone who is inebriated or drug-impaired exists today but is not used. Manufacturers insist it is hard to make it work accurately and yet they expect us to believe they can make a car that will drive from LA to New York City and park itself without human intervention? Come on. Stop taking us for idiots and get it done.

Same with texting. iPhones now know when we are driving and disable themselves until they can be used safely. Speeding is something that all modern cars can control. Some may whine that they don’t want nanny cars but driving on public roads is a privilege not a right. If you want to speed join a motorsports facility that offers track days. Otherwise understand that when you use a public street public safety takes precedence over your dream of being a NASCAR driver.

How simple would it be to have a system that immobilizes a car unless a licensed driver is at the wheel? People without a license or a suspended license have no business driving. Period. Freedom does not imply the ability to maim or kill other human beings. Do whatever you wish on your own personal private property but if you expect society to build public roads public safety is more important than personal liberty.

There are so many ways driving can be made safer and it doesn’t require massive investments or hugely expensive options to make safe driving a reality. The dream of autonomous cars is an illusion at least for the foreseeable future. It works in limited cases on known routes that don’t involve left turns against traffic. Let’s deal with the possible not the fanciful.

Highway deaths are a clear and present danger but those who want to fix the problem with autonomous driving systems are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. The solutions are right under our noses. Let’s use them to end the carnage on our streets and highways.

The investment is also intended to drive innovation across the industry and encourage more public charging infrastructure which will help enable the broader transportation industry to more quickly reduce emissions.

The company is already using thousands of zero-emission vehicles across its European operations and this investment will add thousands more accelerating Amazon’s progress toward becoming net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

“Our transportation network is one of the most challenging areas of our business to decarbonize and to achieve net-zero carbon will require a substantial and sustained investment” said Andy Jassy Amazon CEO. “Deploying thousands of electric vans long-haul trucks and bikes will help us shift further away from traditional fossil fuels—and hopefully further encourage transportation and automotive industries in Europe and around the world to continue scaling and innovating as we will have to work together to reach our climate goals.”

Investment brings more electric delivery vans e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries to cities across Europe

Amazon has more than 3000 electric vans delivering packages to customers across Europe and with the investment announced today expects to grow its fleet to more than 10000 by 2025.

Amazon has launched micro-mobility hubs in more than 20 cities across Europe including London Munich and Paris and expects to double that figure by the end of 2025. Micro-mobility hubs are smaller centrally-located delivery stations. In Europe’s traditionally dense cities the hubs enable Amazon to operate new delivery methods such as e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries to bring packages to customers more sustainably. Micro-mobility hubs take traditional delivery vans off the road which alleviates traffic congestion in city centres and improves air quality.

In addition to these new vans and micro-mobility hubs and vehicles Amazon will also invest in thousands of chargers across its European facilities. The investment will allow the company and its partners to improve fleet charging hardware.

Amazon scales up fleet of electric heavy goods vehicles and expands critical infrastructure to decarbonize long haul trucking

Long haul transportation is a hard-to-decarbonize sector due to the size and weight of the trucks and trailers and the long distances they need to travel. Electric heavy goods vehicles (eHGVs) are a promising technology but eHGV production and charging infrastructure availability are limited. Amazon today has five eHGVs on the road in the UK and will have 20 on the road in Germany by the end of this year.

Amazon is using its size and scale to help spark the scaling of eHGV production so Amazon and others can more quickly transition away from diesel trucks. With the investment announced today Amazon expects to purchase and roll out more than 1500 eHGVs in its European fleet in the coming years.

To power its eHGVs Amazon will build hundreds of specialized fast chargers across its European facilities allowing the company to charge the vehicles in approximately two hours.

Amazon said Monday it plans to spend €1 billion or $972 million on electric vehicles for its European fleet.

The investment would increase the company’s fleet to at least 10000 electric delivery vans by 2025 up from the 3000 it already operates and more than 1500 long-haul electric trucks. It is part of Amazon’s goal to produce net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

Amazon said it also expects to deliver more packages via e-cargo bikes and on foot using centrally-located delivery stations it is calling “micro-mobility hubs.” The company said it already operates such hubs in 20 major European cities including London Munich and Paris.

“In Europe’s traditionally dense cities the hubs enable Amazon to operate new delivery methods … to bring packages to customers more sustainably” said the company’s statement. Amazon expects to double the number of those hubs by the end of 2025.

Amazon (AMZN) said the investment will help drive innovation across the industry and encourage more public charging infrastructure which will enable the broader transportation industry to more quickly reduce emissions.

“Our transportation network is one of the most challenging areas of our business to decarbonize and to achieve net-zero carbon will require a substantial and sustained investment” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. “Deploying thousands of electric vans long-haul trucks and bikes will help us shift further away from traditional fossil fuels.”

Numerous automakers are ramping up production plans for electric delivery vehicles. One of them is electric truck upstart Rivian in which Amazon was a major early investor. Rivian announced last month it had signed a “memorandum of understanding” with Mercedes to work together on production of electric vans in Europe.

Delivery vehicles which run short routes on regular schedules are relatively easy to fully recharge nightly at a company’s warehouse or depot.

But electric semitrucks are more of a challenge as they tend to be on long-distance routes that make efficient recharging difficult. Tesla (TSLA) which has planned to introduce an electric semi for years is set to deliver its first one to Pepsi in December CEO Elon Musk said last week.

Our analysis focuses on four biomes (referred to as regions in the rest of the text) accounting for nearly all soybean area in Brazil: the Pampa the Atlantic Forest the Cerrado and the Amazon (Supplementary Section 1). Soybean production is negligible in the Pantanal and the Caatinga so these two regions were excluded from our analysis. We focused on soybean-based systems in Brazil either those that include one crop per year (single soybean) or those including a second-crop maize. In the latter system soybean is sown in September–October and maize is sown right after the soybean harvest in late January–February. Single soybean is common in the Pampa where the drier climate does not allow double cropping. In contrast higher precipitation allows double cropping in the Amazon the Cerrado and most of the Atlantic Forest (Supplementary Section 2).

Recent trends in yield area and production for soybean and second-crop maize were derived from official statistics for the 2007–2019 period16. We fitted linear models to derive the annual rate of yield improvement and harvested area for soybean and second-crop maize separately for each region (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Land use change arising from soybean expansion was estimated using data from the MapBiomas project (v.5.0)10 (Supplementary Table 1). Our estimation of land use change accounted for the time lag between land conversion and the beginning of soybean production which can include transitional stages such as the cultivation of upland rice or short-term pasture-based livestock systems42. To account for this we looked at the new land brought into soybean production during the 2008–2019 period and we analysed how much of this land was under a different land use type (forest savannah grassland pasture or other crops) in 2000 (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Estimation of yield potential and yield gaps

We used results on yield potential for Brazil that we generated through the Global Yield Gap Atlas project43 using well-validated process-based crop models and the best available sources of weather soil and management data. Briefly we selected 32 sites to portray the distribution of the soybean harvested area within the country following protocols that ensure representativeness and a reasonable coverage of the national crop area44. The 32 sites collectively accounted for half of the soybean harvested area in Brazil. These sites were located within agro-climatic zones accounting for 86% of the national soybean production and accounted for 72–92% of the soybean area in each region. Following protocols that gave preference to measured data at a high level of spatial and temporal resolution45 we collected databases on weather soil management and crop yields for soybean for each site and also for second-crop maize at those sites where double-cropping is practised (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Section 3).

Yield potential was simulated for widespread cultivars in each region using the CROPGRO soybean model embedded in DSSAT v.4.546 and the Hybrid-Maize model47. Both models simulate crop growth and development on a daily time step. Growth rates are determined by simulating both CO 2 assimilation and respiration with partitioning coefficients to different organs dependent on developmental stage. The model phenological coefficients were calibrated to portray the crop cycle of the most dominant cultivars in each region in Brazil. We used generic default coefficients for growth-related model internal parameters such as photosynthesis respiration leaf area expansion light interception biomass partitioning and grain filling. In all cases simulations of yield potential assumed the absence of insect pests weeds and diseases and no nutrient limitations. In simulating yield potential both models account for solar radiation photoperiod temperature and the timing and amount of rainfall as well as soil properties influencing crop water balance.

We first evaluated the CROPGRO and Hybrid-Maize models on the ability to reproduce measured phenology and yields across 40 well-managed experiments located across the four regions. The models showed satisfactory performance at reproducing the measured values (Extended Data Fig. 3). We then simulated soybean yield potential for the dominant agricultural soils at each site (usually two or three) as determined from the soil maps generated by the Radambrasil project48. The simulations were based on long-term (1999–2018) measured daily weather data retrieved from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology49. Soybean yield potential was simulated for each year of the time series. We also simulated yield potential for second-crop maize for those sites where double-cropping is practised. To do so we used sowing dates and cultivar maturities that maximize the overall productivity of the soybean–maize system; these sowing dates and cultivar maturities are within the current ranges in each region2128. To estimate the average yield potential for each site we weighted the simulated values for each soil type by soil area fraction at each site. In all cases the simulations assumed no limitations to crop growth due to nutrient deficiencies or incidence of biotic stresses such as weeds insect pests and pathogens. The results were upscaled from site to region and then to country following van Bussel et al.44. Briefly the average yield potential for each region was estimated by averaging the simulated yields across the sites located within each region weighing sites according to their share of the soybean area within each region. A similar approach was followed to upscale yield potential from region to the national level. Details on crop modelling data sources and upscaling are provided in Supplementary Section 3.

The average farmer yield was calculated separately for soybean and second-crop maize on the basis of the average yield reported over the 2012–2017 period for the municipalities that overlap with each site weighing municipalities on the basis of their share of the soybean or maize area within each site16. Including more years before 2012 would have led to a biased estimate of average actual yield due to the technological yield trend in Brazil. Average farmer yields were estimated at the region and country levels following the same upscaling approach as for yield potential. Finally the exploitable yield gap was calculated as the difference between attainable yield and average farmer yield. The attainable yield was calculated as 80% of the simulated yield potential which is considered a reasonable yield for farmers with adequate access to inputs markets and technical information (Supplementary Section 2).

Assessing scenarios of intensification and land use change

We explored three scenarios with different soybean and maize yields and areas by 2035 and assessed their outcomes in terms of production land use change and GWP (Supplementary Table 4). A 15-year future timespan is long enough to facilitate the implementation of long-term policies investments and technologies devoted to closing the exploitable yield gap and to implement land-use policies but it is short enough to minimize long-term effects from climate change on crop yields and cropping systems. In the BAU scenario historical (2007–2019) trends of soybean and second-crop maize area and yield (Extended Data Fig. 1) remain unchanged in all regions between the baseline year (2019) and the final year (2035). Likewise soybean area expands following the same pattern of land use change observed during 2008–2019 (Extended Data Fig. 2).

To explore the available opportunity for increasing production on the existing production area we considered an NCE scenario in which there is no physical expansion of cropland while full closure of the exploitable yield gap occurs in the regions where the current yield gaps are small (the Pampa and the Atlantic Forest) and 50% closure of the exploitable yield gap takes place in regions where the current yield gaps are large (the Amazon and the Cerrado) (Supplementary Table 4). These rates are comparable to historical yield gains in the Pampa and the Atlantic Forest. A scenario of full yield closure in the Amazon and the Cerrado would have been unrealistic as it would have required rates of yield improvement that are three to four times higher than historical rates much higher than those in the Pampa and the Atlantic Forest and well beyond those reported for main soybean-producing countries. In the case of second-crop maize we assumed full closure of the exploitable yield gap by 2035 because historical rates of yield improvement are adequate to reach that yield level. Regarding second-crop maize area we projected the proportion of double-cropping to increase from the current 47% (Amazon) 39% (Cerrado) and 31% (Atlantic Forest) to 100% 70% and 50% respectively as determined on the basis of the degree of water limitation in each region (Supplementary Section 4).

Finally we explored a third scenario of intensification plus target area expansion (INT) in which identical yield gain rates and the adoption of double-cropping equivalent to those in the NCE scenario were assumed but with physical expansion of the soybean–maize system allowed in low-C ecosystems (that is pastures and grasslands). In this scenario soybean expansion is limited to 5% of existing pastures and grasslands in the Pampa the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado (total of 5.7 Mha) as a result of a parallel intensification in the pasture-based livestock sector that frees up land for soybean production. The latter would require an increase of current stocking rates not only for freeing up 5% of the area for soybean cultivation but also to meet the projected 7% beef production increase during the study period (2020–2035)17. Hence an overall 12% increase in stocking rates would be required within our 15-year timeframe which is a reasonable target as reported in previous studies and based on current trends in stocking rates16293233.

Another assumption is that the yield potential of pasture and grasslands converted for soybean production is similar to that in existing soybean areas in each region. Cropland expansion into grassland and pastures was allowed in all regions except for the Amazon to prevent ‘leaking’ effects and the impact of road development on land clearing5051. Similarly the conversion of area cultivated with food crops for soybean production was not allowed to avoid the negative impact of indirect land use change52.

Estimation of GWP and gross income

We estimated GHG emissions including carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxides (N 2 O) associated with land conversion (GHG LUC ) and crop production (GHG PROD ) for the baseline year (2019) and for the three scenarios by year 2035 (BAU NCE and INT). GHG LUC includes emissions associated with changes in C stocks from aboveground and belowground biomass when land is converted for soybean production (GHG BIO ) as well as GHG emissions derived from changes in soil organic C (GHG SOC ). For each land use type annual GHG BIO was estimated on the basis of the difference between C stocks of the land use type that was converted for production (Supplementary Table 5) and depending on the scenario and region the average C stocks of the new cropping system535455:

$${\mathrm{GHG}}_{{\mathrm{BIO}}} = {\sum} {\left( {{\mathrm{TDM}}_i-{\mathrm{TDM}}_{{\mathrm{crop}}}} \right) \times A_i}$$ (1)

where i is the land cover type TDM is the total dry matter (tC ha−1) in land cover type i and in cropland (crop) and A i is the annual area converted from land use type i for soybean cultivation (Supplementary Table 4). C stocks for single soybean and soybean–second-crop maize systems were assumed at 2 and 5 tC ha−1 respectively535455. Changes in SOC stocks were estimated following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 guidelines54 available country-specific emission factors56 and the SOC values estimated for each region5758:

$${\mathrm{GHG}}_{{\mathrm{SOC}}} = {\sum} {\left( {{\mathrm{SOC}}_{{\mathrm{REF}}i} \times F_{{\mathrm{LU}}}} \right) \times A_i}$$ (2)

where SOC REF is the SOC stock for mineral soils in the upper 30 cm for the reference condition (tC ha−1)57 in land cover type i (Supplementary Table 5) and F LU is the stock change factor for SOC land-use systems for a particular land use (Supplementary Table 4). Because no-till is the predominant soil management strategy in Brazil59 we used F LU = 0.96 for natural vegetation converted to no-till annual crop production and F LU = 1.16 for pasture and grassland converted to no-till annual crop production56. Because we wanted to assess the full impact of the three scenarios (BAU NCE and INT) on GWP we assigned all GHG BIO and GHG SOC derived from land conversion to the first year after land conversion and expressed them as CO 2 equivalents by multiplying changes in C stocks by 3.67.

Annual GHG emissions derived from soybean and second-crop maize production (GHG PROD ) were calculated for each scenario and included those derived from manufacturing packaging and transportation of agricultural inputs fossil fuel use for field operations soil N 2 O emissions derived from the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer and domestic grain transportation. For the baseline year (2019) annual GHG emissions from N phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers and other inputs (lime pesticides and fuel) were calculated on the basis of current average input rates for soybean and second-crop maize in each region as derived from the crop management data collected for each region (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Section 3.4). To calculate GHG emissions associated with manufacturing packaging and transportation of N P and K fertilizers and lime we used specific updated emissions factors for South America60 selecting those fertilizer sources that are most commonly used for soybean and second-crop maize production: urea (N) monoammonium phosphate (P) and potassium chloride (K). Our calculations also included the extra lime application that is needed to correct soil acidity in converted areas. Emission factors associated with seed production pesticides and diesel were derived from ref. 61. Soil N 2 O emissions derived from N fertilizer application were calculated assuming an N 2 O emission factor of 1% of the applied N fertilizer on the basis of the country-specific emission factor62. Emissions derived from domestic grain transportation for each region were estimated using the GHGs per ton of grain as reported by previous studies for each region63. We assumed that inputs other than nutrient fertilizer will not change relative to the baseline in the BAU scenario. In the INT scenario applied inputs were calculated on the basis of those reported for current high-yield fields where the yield gap is small. We estimated fertilizer nutrient rates for the three scenarios following a nutrient-balance approach that depends on the projected yield for each scenario (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Section 3.4).

GHG PROD in the baseline year (2019) and for the three scenarios in 2035 (BAU NCE and INT) was estimated for each region by multiplying the emissions per unit of area by the annual soybean harvested area summing them to estimate GHG emissions at the national level. Overall 100-year GWP was estimated as the sum of GHG LUC and GHG PROD  both expressed as CO 2 e to account for the higher warming potential of CH 4 and N 2 O which are 25 and 298 times the intensity of CO 2 on a per mass basis respectively. The gross income was estimated for each scenario by multiplying the annual crop production by the average price for soybean and maize grain during the past ten years (US$453 and US$184 per t for soybean and maize respectively1). Finally to combine the environmental and economic impacts into one metric we calculated the GWP intensity as the ratio between GWP and gross income.

A nationwide shortage of meter bases had some local home sales on hold and hundreds of people in Mid-Missouri on waiting lists.

Electric meters need to slide into meter base boxes before they can supply power.

Supply chain disruptions made some meter bases unavailable.

Boone County Home Builder Matt Cavanaugh works with commercial and residential properties.

Cavanaugh got an email saying the 400-amp meter base typically supplied by Boone Electric Cooperative was unavailable.

Boone Electric eventually supplied the meter base to Cavanaugh after putting him on a waiting list.

Cavanaugh said the waiting list was about 6 to 8 months.



Cavanaugh said “That’s a problem if you’re building houses trying to get them sold get an occupancy permit to get them off your construction loan and things like that. It definitely shuts down the process if you don’t have the ability to get power to your house.”

Boone Electric Manager of Member Services Laura Baker said her company had a limited supply of meter base boxes for people on a waiting list unlike before when a member could come anytime and pick them up.

Baker said “Once they are on that list we verify that their permits are good to go and they are ready for the 400-amp meter base. Once we have one in stock and everything has been checked out then we give them a call and tell them to come pick it up and pay for it.”

City of Columbia Water & Light officials continue to provide electric service to new developments at this time.

Columbia Utilities Spokesman Matt Nestor said providing service in a timely manner will not be possible in the near future because of supply chain shortages.

Nestor said transformers currently had delivery times of more than a year.

Ameren Missouri Spokesman Jeff Trammell said Ameren did not use 400-amp meter boxes so it’s not an issue for them.

Cavanaugh said electrical supply shortages will get worse before they get better.

“The lead times are just getting longer and longer"" said Cavanaugh. ""It’s double and triple of what I ever thought possible four years ago.”

Cavanaugh said most electrical supplies had doubled in price if you can find them.

Meter bases that were $50 were now likely to be closer to $100.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The investment supports American’s science based targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035 and ultimately its commitment to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. This investment makes American the first U.S. airline to make two direct investments focused on the development of both hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and the future of hydrogen distribution logistics.

Universal Hydrogen’s fuel distribution network uses modular hydrogen capsules that are handled like cargo eliminating the need for new fueling infrastructure at airports and speeding up fuel loading operations. Universal Hydrogen anticipates starting hydrogen deliveries for regional aircraft in 2025 with plans to expand its services to larger single aisle aircraft — first for auxiliary power in the late-2020s and then as a primary fuel by the mid-2030s. Because these segments represent two-thirds of aviation emissions — and with green hydrogen being a true zero-carbon fuel — these advances put aviation on a path to meet Paris Agreement emissions targets.

“This technology has the potential to be a game-changer on the industry’s path to zero-emission flight” said American’s Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr. “As the world’s largest airline American has a responsibility to exercise leadership in making aviation sustainable. Our investment in Universal Hydrogen represents a vote of confidence for green hydrogen as a key element of a sustainable future for our industry.”

American joins Airbus Ventures GE Aviation and Toyota Ventures as well as several major hydrogen producers and aircraft lessors as strategic investors in Universal Hydrogen.

“Together with our investors we are putting together the end-to-end value chain to make hydrogen aviation a near-term commercial reality” said Paul Eremenko co-founder and CEO of Universal Hydrogen. “This move by American is a strong signal that customers want a true zero-emissions solution for passenger aviation and are willing to back tangible pragmatic steps to get there quickly.”

But as the threat of climate change driven by carbon pollution becomes more dire and as technological advances make wind solar and battery storage ever cheaper options for powering homes and business states corporations and voters are increasingly pushing to aggressively decarbonize the grid.

Power generation resulted in more than 1.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and accounted for about a quarter of all U.S. carbon emissions. Transportation contributes another 27% and policies to speed up electric vehicle adoption including in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rely on the electricity needed to charge all those battery-powered cars being produced cleanly.

Thirty states and Washington D.C. have active renewable or clean energy requirements and three other states have voluntary renewable energy goals per the National Conference of State Legislatures. And major corporations — from Amazon Target and Microsoft to Boeing and Google — are also increasingly becoming major green power consumers.

That collective momentum has led to a flood of renewable energy development — thousands of projects billions of dollars in capital and thousands of jobs — but getting that electricity to customers is more complicated than just building solar panels and wind turbines.

Millions of American electric customers are in territories managed by entities called regional transmission organizations or independent system operators which are tasked with managing the flow of electricity across the grid running electric markets ensuring reliability and overseeing new interconnections.

And while grid operators say they’re doing their best to manage the renewable transition while ensuring reliability and keeping costs stable critics contend they’ve been caught flatfooted and are only just now coming to grips with the new demands of a changing power system on their markets and interconnection queues. That’s creating a bottleneck that’s holding up thousands of projects that could help create a cleaner and more resilient grid and tripping up state clean power goals.

Running the grid

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) created standards for regional transmission organizations in a 1999 order in part to spur better regional grid management and more competitive wholesale electric markets.

There are currently seven regional transmission organizations or independent system operators operating in the United States right now. The biggest PJM is one of the largest wholesale electric markets in the world and coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of 13 states and Washington D.C. a territory that numbers 65 million people. Roughly two-thirds of American electric customers live in an area where service is managed by a regional transmission organization (RTO) or an independent system operator (ISO) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In the West and Southeast customers are generally served by traditional utilities that are typically vertically integrated (meaning they’re responsible for generating transmitting and distributing electricity to their customers) who do their own planning and trade power with each other but not as part of an organized market like in an RTO said Seth Blumsack a professor of energy policy and economics at Penn State.

The differences between an RTO and ISO are largely technical with the FERC setting out specific requirements for RTOs.

“They functionally do the same thing nowadays” said Jeff Dennis managing director and general counsel of Advanced Energy Economy a trade group that represents more than 100 companies working in energy efficiency demand response energy storage solar wind hydro nuclear electric vehicles biofuels and smart grid technologies.

“There are sort of three reasons they matter: markets transmission and reliability” said Casey Roberts a senior attorney with the Sierra Club who focuses on regional transmission organizations. “Those markets and how they’re designed determine what revenue generators earn and how often they run.”

Because they’re charged with managing the grid and ensuring reliability RTOs and ISOs also oversee new connections for power generators. And across the country they’ve been buried in the past several years by an avalanche of interconnection requests mostly from wind and solar and increasingly battery storage developers in part spurred by how cheap those generation sources have become and also as a result of states’ clean energy policies.

“A number of these RTOs have decision systems that were designed for a bygone era of the grid” Blumsack said. “They were sort of designed when your market participants were transmission owners big generation owners utilities. As you have mandates for new technologies and all these new market actors emerging it’s been hard for some RTOs to integrate them.”

The queue blues

The most conspicuous example of that dynamic has been the interconnection queues in which thousands of projects mostly wind and solar languish while waiting for approval to connect to the grid. There’s been little regional and interregional transmission expansion in the past decade said John Moore director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Sustainable FERC Project. For example wind energy is abundant in parts of the Midwest and West but it needs long-range transmission lines to get it to population centers that comprise the bulk of the electric load.

“With all of those pressures on the grid it was to some extent predictable but unfortunate that we’re at this point — with a big backlog and delays for renewable projects” Moore said.

Developers also in many cases can’t get good information on the costs of that connection and any associated grid upgrades they’ll be required to pay for prior to application Roberts and other critics say leading to developers filing for multiple projects just to find the best place to site a single solar array for example.

“Usually developers don’t start putting steel in the ground until they have the results of their interconnection study” Roberts said. “Sometimes the interconnection costs can be more than 50% of the project cost.”

Many grid operators have struggled to manage their interconnection queues. For example the Midcontinent Independent System Operator or MISO which encompasses parts or all of 15 states stretching from Minnesota to Louisiana has hundreds of mostly wind and solar projects in its interconnection queue that amounted to a capacity of more than 118000 megawatts as of Sept. 19. However MISO got an interconnection reform plan approved by the FERC earlier this year that is intended to streamline the process.

But nowhere has the problem been more pronounced than within PJM which is headquartered near Philadelphia.

“They exist in many many places in the country” said Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy. “PJM has just been the worst example in recent years.”

As of early September PJM had more than 2500 projects in the queue with a total capacity of more than 22500 megawatts according to Ken Seiler PJM’s vice president of planning. For some perspective that’s more than the maximum output of all the power generation in the PJM region right now (about 185000 MW).

“Here’s the crazy thing about the interconnection backlog that PJM finds themselves in” said Lorig Charkoudian a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates whose district is just outside Washington. “PJM would tell you that what they do what they take pride in is they forecast and they plan. Here we have a situation where you could have absolutely forecast this moment if you wanted to.”

Charkoudian an economist points to examples like PJM rules that have since been overhauled but initially penalized renewable energy sources trying to participate in PJM’s capacity market. She also criticized the grid operator’s previous restrictions on battery storage as hindering Maryland and other states with aggressive plans to decarbonize.

“You knew this moment was coming you had a structure in place that was unworkable.

Forecasting is what you do. Fix it. And fix it 10 years ago” she said.

Reforms to the rescue?

PJM and other RTOs say they are.

“The existing planning queue was designed to process larger centralized generation resources that were far fewer in number” said Seiler the PJM vice president of planning. “It was also not designed to weed out the many speculative projects that may not have the financing or other means necessary to bring the project to completion.”

A new interconnection process developed by a PJM task force starting in 2021 has been filed for approval with the FERC and will shift to a “first-ready first-served basis rather than first come first-served.” The new framework also includes a “cluster” approach to studying interconnection costs reducing the number of additional studies required when projects are modified and streamlining interconnections for projects “that do not contribute to the need for network upgrades.”

“Along with the process revisions PJM studied more projects than all other RTOs combined in 2020 leading to 30000 MW worth of generation completing the study process and having executed final agreements in hand. Despite this only 1500 MW worth of generation has gone commercial in 2022 as developers face additional challenges beyond the interconnection study process” Seiler said.

For some renewable developers environmental advocates and state politicians though it’s an imperfect fix. For one PJM is proposing to freeze its queue for two years to work through the backlog creating delays for projects that haven’t been filed yet. (By comparison MISO is pushing to cut its interconnection application process to about a year without any freeze on new requests.) Going forward PJM envisions processing new interconnection requests within two years.

In comments to the FERC the Organization of PJM States which represents state public service commissions in PJM territory called the reforms a “step in the right direction” and a “considerable improvement to the existing processes which is hindering some states’ ability to achieve their policy goals.”

However while the group encouraged FERC to approve the plan it said it was “deeply concerned that even under PJM’s proposed reforms a project entering the queue today may not be able to achieve commercial operation until nearly 2030.”

‘A potential roadblock’

Aside from the queue problems critics say capacity markets like PJM’s intended to ensure there’s enough available electricity to handle spikes in load are tilted toward fossil fuel generators and allow old inefficient and polluting power plants to limp along rather than be retired as well as charge electric customers for capacity they don’t need.

“In terms of what the role is RTOs are both critically important for the clean energy transition but also without reform of their markets a potential roadblock to the clean energy transition” Dennis said.

RTO markets Dennis said were designed 20 to 25 years ago around the generation of the time primarily coal gas and nuclear power plants.

“The resources that we will rely on in the future have different technical and operating characteristics” he said. “That’s really where we are in a market like PJM. We’re trying to evolve these rules.”

Seiler the PJM vice president said the organization is “committed to a reliable energy transition as cost-effectively and reliably facilitating state decarbonization policies (and other state policies) through our competitive markets operations and planning processes.

“This is at the heart of almost everything we do today.”

‘Steps in the right direction’

For renewable energy developers and advocates though there are signs that RTOs are working better with states to help them meet their goals.

MISO recently approved more than $10 billion for 18 transmission projects comprising more than 2000 miles of transmission line in the upper Midwest including in Michigan Wisconsin Illinois Indiana Iowa Minnesota Missouri and the Dakotas. The plan “represents the most complex transmission study effort in MISO’s history” the grid operator said and will provide a host of benefits for the grid.

“Carbon-free and clean energy goals set by MISO member utilities state and municipal government policies and customer preferences continue to drive growth in wind solar battery and hybrid projects” MISO said. “As the region faces both a changing resource fleet and increased prevalence of extreme weather events the ability to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed most becomes paramount.”

PJM also reached a novel deal with the Board of Public Utilities in New Jersey which has set an ambitious goal for offshore wind energy development (7500 megawatts by 2035) that will allow a “first-of-its-kind competitive transmission process” administered by PJM which is expected to drive down costs of getting that wind-generated electricity to customers as long as New Jersey handles the bill within its own borders.

“The provision enables a state or group of states to propose a project to assist in realizing state public policy requirements as long as the state (or states) agrees to pay all costs of any state-selected build-out” PJM said in a news release.

Then there’s what Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy called an “aggressive agenda” by the FERC itself to help smooth the renewable transition for grid operators and developers alike.

A recent FERC order for instance directs RTOs and ISOs to remove barriers to electric market participation for energy storage a crucial technology to balancing the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.

And two other proposed major rules deal with transmission and interconnection respectively.

“Who pays for transmission is one of the biggest barriers to getting transmission built” Dennis said. “FERC is trying to streamline that by determining who the beneficiaries are in a standardized way.” The hope is the change will head off one of the most common objections by states to new transmission — that their residents are paying for it without getting enough benefit Dennis said.

The proposed interconnection rule is aimed squarely at expediting the queue backlogs for connecting new electric generation to the grid.

“At the end of 2021 there were more than 1400 gigawatts of generation and storage waiting in interconnection queues throughout the country. This is more than triple the total volume just five years ago. Projects now face an average timeline of more than three years to get connected to the grid” FERC said in a June news release.

The main components are:

a “first-ready first-served” cluster study process in which large interconnection studies encompassing multiple generating facilities rather than individual ones

imposing firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete studies on time

allowing multiple generators to share a single interconnection request and co-locate on a shared site.

better modeling for how “non-synchronous” generating facilities like wind solar and storage will actually perform when they connect to the grid.

“They’re definitely both steps in the right direction” said Roberts the Sierra Club attorney. “It’s really important for FERC to set a baseline for transmission and interconnection that will work better for consumers. “",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vY29tbW9kaXR5aW5zaWdodHMvZW4vbWFya2V0LWluc2lnaHRzL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL25hdHVyYWwtZ2FzLzEwMTAyMi11cy1wb3dlci10cmFja2VyLXNvdXRoZWFzdC1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1wcmljZXMtZmFsbC1vbi1tb250aC1yaXNlLW9uLXllYXItdHJhY2tpbmctbmF0dXJhbC1nYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US POWER TRACKER: Southeast electricity prices fall on month rise on year tracking natural gas,"For access to all regions in the US Power Tracker series subscribe to Platts Dimensions Pro.

Southeast US day-ahead bilateral power indexes in September fell about 19% from August but up by more than 60% from September 2021 largely because of gas price trends.

Florida power indexes weakened faster as Hurricane Ian crushed power demand in the last week.

November power forwards fell in September with a similar widening spread between Florida and other Into Southern indexes but remained significantly higher than November 2021 forwards in September 2021 S&P Global Commodity Insights data shows.

Day-ahead on-peak bilaterals averaged in the mid- to high $90s/MWh in September down from about $116.50/MWh to $121/MWh in August but up from about $55 to about $60.50/MWh in September 2021.

Ian's impact

Hurricane Ian made landfall shortly after 3 pm on Sept. 28 as a Category 4 hurricane packing 155 mph winds and storm surges ranging as high as 18 feet across significant stretches of the Florida Gulf Coast ultimately cutting power to about 2.8 million of the state's 11 million electricity customers of whom 20000 remained without service as of 1 pm ET Oct. 10.

Florida power day-ahead on-peak indexes averaged $60/MWh Sept. 28-30 compared with the $104.49/MWh for the rest of September a decrease of 42.6%. As context the Into TVA day-ahead on-peak index was $59.50/MWh Sept. 28-30 compared with $102.10/MWh for the rest of the month a 41.7% decrease.

Power demand in the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council which covers all of the state except the Panhandle fell to 25.3 GW Sept. 29 down 18.6 GW or 42.4% from the recent peak of 43.8 GW Sept. 26 according to US Energy Information Administration data.

Weather vs. fuel effects

For the month FRCC loads averaged 32.9 GW in September S&P Global data shows which is up 5.6% from 31.1 GW September 2021 but down 8.7% from 36 GW in August.

Florida's population-weighted cooling degree days in September averaged up 4.9% from September 2021 but down 13.5% from August CustomWeather data shows.

In the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's SERC region formerly known as the Southeast Electric Reliability Council loads averaged 77.8 GW in September up 0.4% from 77. 5 GW in September 2021 but down 12% from 88.4 GW in August according to S&P Global data.

In Georgia which lies near the center of the SERC region September's population-weighted CDDs averaged 9.3% higher than September 2021 but almost 35% below August.

At the Florida Gas Zone 3 pipeline spot natural gas averaged $8.468/MMBtu in September up 65.3% from September 2021 $5.122/MMBtu but down 14% from $9.845/MMBtu in August.

At the Transco Zone 4 pipeline which is important for Into Southern power pricing spot gas averaged $8.307/MMBtu in September up 65% from $5.035/MMBtu September 2021 but down 14.5% from $9.714/MMBtu in August.

Generation mix

Gas-fired generation maintained its leading share across the Southeast approach 80% in FRCC and approaching 39% in the SERC region according to Energy Information Administration data that S&P Global collected. FRCC's August share was 76.7% and September 2021 share was 75.8%. SERC's August share was 40.4% in August and 34.6% in September 2021.

Nuclear power came in second in both regions with 8.3% in FRCC and 31% in SERC followed by coal-fired generation at 6.4% in FRCC and 21.4% in SERC.

FRCC's August nuclear share was 11% and September 2021 share was 9.2%. FRCC's coal-fired share was 6.6% in August and 9.9% in September 2021.

SERC's August nuclear share was 29.6% and September 2021's was 30.6% SERC's coal-fired share was 21.9% in August and 25% in September 2021.

Forward markets

In forward markets Florida November power averaged $81.05/MWh in September down 14% from $94.25/MWh in August but up 66.7% from the $48.65/MWh that November 2021 power averaged in September 2021.

Into Southern November power averaged $92.45/MWh in September down 6.7% from August's $99.10/MWh but up 97.5% from the $46.80/MWh that November 2021 power averaged in September 2021.

Florida Gas Zone 3 November gas averaged $8.456/MMBtu in September down 9.8% from August's $9.375/MMBtu but up 60.8% from the $5.258/MMBtu that November 2021 gas averaged in September 2021.

Transco Zone 4 November gas averaged $8.34/MMBtu in September down 10% from August's $9.268/MMBtu but up 60.5% from the $5.197/MMBtu that November 2021 gas averaged in September 2021.

The National Weather Service's latest forecast for November December and January calls for enhanced chances—33% to 50%—for above-normal temperatures across most of the region with the greatest chances along the Gulf and South Atlantic coasts. The rest of the Southeast has even chances for above- and below-normal temperatures in the forecast issued Sept. 15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9yZXBvcnQtc2F5cy1tYW55LXV0aWxpdGllcy1hcmUtc2xvdy13YWxraW5nLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1nb2Fscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report says many utilities are slow-walking clean energy goals • Louisiana Illuminator,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9yZXBvcnQtc2F5cy1tYW55LXV0aWxpdGllcy1hcmUtc2xvdy13YWxraW5nLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1nb2Fscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC894F8B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9yZXBvcnQtc2F5cy1tYW55LXV0aWxpdGllcy1hcmUtc2xvdy13YWxraW5nLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1nb2Fscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFyeW1lZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lbmVyZ3ktZXF1aXR5L3Bvd2VyLWJ5LXRoZS1wZW9wbGUtbmF0aXZlLWVuZXJneS1zb3ZlcmVpZ250edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With renewables Native communities chart a path to energy sovereignty,"This article is part of our weeklong series Power by the People: Clean Energy from the Grassroots.

To Robert Blake a tribal citizen of the Red Lake Nation of Ojibwe people solar power isn’t just a tool to escape energy poverty. It’s the key to ​“energy sovereignty” — a way for his people to regain control over their own energy decisions and continue to be stewards of the land they’ve lived on for centuries.

Blake’s solar company Solar Bear — pronounced Gizis-o-makwa in the Ojibwe language — has led the construction of the tribal nation’s first two solar installations a 70-kilowatt system on the roof of the Government Center in the town of Red Lake Minnesota and a 240-kilowatt system at a workforce development center named Oshkiimaajitahdah or New Beginnings in the nearby town of Redby. It’s planning 20 more commercial-building solar systems along with a 13-megawatt solar farm.

Solar power is cheaper over the long run than utility electricity in the area which is important for a community where the median per capita income is about $10000 and 45 percent of children live in poverty. ​“We see a high density of energy poverty” Blake said with families often forced to choose between paying their power bills or buying food.

Solar development also means economic opportunity. The Red Lake Indian Reservation with a population of about 5500 has an unemployment rate of 24 percent. Most of the available jobs are linked to tribal government and most revenue is generated by Red Lake’s casinos. ​“We wanted to create jobs entrepreneurship opportunities” Blake said.

The ecological benefits of solar power are significant too for a tribe that has lived on the same 1260 square miles of land since the 18th century. High levels of mercury from more than a century of coal power plant emissions have polluted the nearby Great Lakes and have been detected in the fish in the community’s namesake body of water Red Lake home to the country’s largest and oldest commercial walleye fishery. The tribe has fought the construction of fossil fuel pipelines across its land which bring the risk of catastrophic explosions and oil spills as well as worsening climate change.

Blake views the fossil-fuel energy system as part and parcel of an ​“extractive and predatory” economic system one that threatens not just the communities and ecosystems directly harmed by it but the entire planet. Native people can now ​“take back these profits take back these resources and start taking care of the planet and taking care of our communities” he said.

On the Red Lake reservation that means creating a tribal utility and other structures to manage the tribe’s own energy affairs he said. In March for example the Red Lake Nation won federal approval for the first-ever Tribal Energy Development Organization a structure that gives it more freedom to negotiate land leases and energy agreements.

But it also means helping other tribal nations and Indigenous communities develop energy sovereignty he said. That’s the goal of Native Sun Community Power Development a nonprofit Blake founded that’s working on creating pan-tribal clean energy and electrification projects such as an electric-vehicle charging partnership between the Red Lake reservation and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

It’s also the purpose of the Indigenized Energy Initiative a nonprofit that’s brought together tribal leaders including Blake Chief Henry Red Cloud of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Tribe Otto Braided Hair of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and Cody Two Bears of the Standing Rock Sioux.

These tribal leaders have organized projects like the 300-kilowatt community solar array built on Standing Rock land which grew out of Two Bears’ work organizing protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe’s 1.25-megawatt White River Community Solar project in the heart of eastern Montana coal country.

Though there are enormous fossil fuel resources beneath North American native lands Indigenous people have more often been exploited than uplifted by fossil fuel development and they’ve been left out of the expansion of modern energy systems said Chéri A. Smith founder and CEO of Indigenized Energy and a descendant of the Mi’kmaq Tribe of present-day Maine and the Canadian Maritime provinces. About 14 percent of households on Native American reservations lack electricity access compared to about 1.4 percent of U.S. households on average. On some reservations like the Pine Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Lakota in South Dakota that rate is closer to 40 percent.

With the threat of climate change bearing down it’s become clear that fossil fuel development is not a viable way to expand economic and energy equity said Smith who was just named a 2022 MIT Solve Indigenous Communities Fellow. ​“We are gathering experts Native and non-Native — that’s what it takes to get this done until these tribes are truly sovereign.”

Tribal energy past and future

Tribal energy development is nothing new. From the coal mines of Navajo Nation to the oil fields of the Alaska North Slope many tribal nations have been in the energy business for decades. There are tribal-run hydroelectric projects and biomass-to-energy plants. And as solar and wind power have become the cheapest and fastest-growing sources of electricity generation tribes have begun to develop those resources as well.

The Moapa Indian Reservation home of the Moapa Band of Paiutes became host of the first utility-scale solar project built on tribal land to sell its power outside its borders in 2017. That’s when First Solar completed its 250-megawatt plant about 30 miles northwest of Las Vegas Nevada and then sold it to Capital Dynamics.

More solar and wind development is sure to follow given the enormous renewable energy potential across the country’s tribal lands. A 2018 report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory identified that 5.4 percent of total U.S. solar potential and 7.8 percent of total wind potential are within tribal borders. Those ratios rose to 11.5 percent and 16 percent respectively when land within 10 miles of tribal borders was included.

But with this potential comes great responsibility — to protect the land and to ensure that development benefits rather than exploits the people living on it. ​“If this transition isn’t done by Native people for Native people it can be just as extractive as fossil development” Smith said.

One of the first priorities of tribal nations is breaking the cycle of energy poverty in tribal communities she said — ​“discriminatory practices forcing people to choose between heating and eating.”

Tribal communities often face much higher-than-average energy costs because of their relative isolation from the power grids that serve more densely populated areas or their dependence on trucked-in heating fuels.

Navajo (Diné) tribe member Wahleah Johns director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs said that decades of neglect from private utilities as well as discriminatory programs created by the New Deal–era Rural Electrification Act left many Native communities disconnected from the country’s broader energy system.

Native Renewables an off-grid solar power nonprofit that Johns led before joining DOE has calculated that many families in the Navajo Nation pay between $150 and $700 per month on fuels to power heating and generators.

Even where grid connections exist Smith said many residents of reservations like Standing Rock and Northern Cheyenne are ​“charged twice as much if not more for their electrons as people living right down the road” because of discriminatory rate structures she said. The impact of those higher rates is compounded by poorly built and insulated homes using out-of-date heating systems she added.

Tribal organizations are taking a multipronged approach to solving these inequities. Red Cloud Renewable Energy Center the organization founded by Chief Henry Red Cloud constructs and trains Native workers on sustainable and energy-efficient building practices and solar air heating systems as well as installing solar PV arrays.

Some tribes such as the Navajo Nation have formed their own utilities to build infrastructure and control cost and rate structures. That’s what Blake is proposing for the Red Lake reservation: ​“We want to protect our communities against these predatory energy companies that are preying on Native people” he said.

That can mean making some hard choices. Blake recounted the Red Lake reservation’s decision to reject an offer from Enbridge the Canada-based fossil fuel pipeline operator to pay the tribe $55 million for rights to build a pipeline across tribal lands. ​“For a frontline community to say no to that kind of money is incredible” he said.

But the risks of expanding fossil fuel infrastructure on tribal lands outweigh the benefits he said. Clean energy by contrast is falling in cost and offers resiliency when extreme weather threatens the reliability of the power grid he said.

“We need more distributed energy resources not only in tribal communities” he said.

Building out clean energy while restoring tribal lifeways

Tribes in the Pacific Northwest are also rejecting the old paradigm of dirty energy infrastructure in favor of a restorative approach to energy development.

Native groups and conservationists have for decades called for breaching the four hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River to restore fish runs that have sustained Pacific Northwest tribes for millennia but are now endangered. These plans gained traction last year when U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson an Idaho Republican and Rep. Earl Blumenauer an Oregon Democrat put forth a $33 billion plan to breach the dams and replace the roughly 5.3 gigawatts of power those dams generate with alternative resources.

Whether to breach the dams remains a highly controversial question however with energy experts providing contradictory views on how dam removal will affect the cost of energy now supplied by the greater Columbia River Basin’s hydroelectric complex of which the Snake River dams are a part.

Last month the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission representing four tribes with treaty rights to healthy Snake River fisheries released a comprehensive Tribal Energy Vision that lays out a plan it says combines clean reliable and affordable energy with a much greater role for tribes in building that future.

One key point raised by the Tribal Energy Vision is that the region can’t continue to ​“add solar and wind and use the hydro system as a battery” said Chris Golightly a policy analyst who contributed to the report. In simple terms operating the region’s dams to store hydropower for the hours or seasons when wind and solar power are scarce is incompatible with legally binding requirements to operate the dams to allow fish populations to recover she said.

The broader implication said Jeremy FiveCrows the council’s communications director is that energy planning cannot be separated from its environmental or ecological impacts.

“There’s a way to make this energy transition beneficial to the environment not just for climate impacts but for a much more sensible and sustainable way to operate the river system” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJ5bGFuZG1hdHRlcnMub3JnLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvZm9yLW9mZnNob3JlLXdpbmQtYXNwaXJhdGlvbnMtdG8tYmVjb21lLXJlYWxpdHktdHJhbnNtaXNzaW9uLWh1cmRsZXMtbXVzdC1iZS1jbGVhcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For offshore wind aspirations to become reality transmission hurdles must be cleared,"President Biden’s administration laid out ambitious additional goals last month to boost offshore wind power generation one of the American renewable energy industry’s emerging wide open frontiers.

The federal announcements come as coastal states across the country increasingly are setting offshore wind energy targets seeking to capture not just clean energy but the potentially big economic benefits of their ports serving as hubs for the vessels blade manufacturing cables and other infrastructure needed to get turbines that are more than 850 feet tall installed miles out at sea.

But amid news releases touting megawatt targets and jobs there’s been less attention on the challenge of bringing all that electricity ashore and connecting it to a grid that was designed to bring power to the coast not the other way around.

“It is so exciting to see the goals put forward and it’s a great signal and clear signal to the industry” said Maddy Urbish head of government affairs and market strategy for New Jersey at Ørsted North America. The Danish company a world leader in offshore wind currently has 5000 megawatts of projects under development or under construction in U.S. waters including one of the two projects on tap off the coast of Ocean City.

“So that’s incredibly encouraging and exciting for the industry. When we get down to the challenges we see from the grid it becomes immediately less sexy” Urbish said.

A sea change

With nearly 95500 miles of coastline and steady wind resources offshore developers like Ørsted see vast potential in the U.S. market. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that domestic offshore wind generation potential is roughly equal to double the nation’s total electric demand. What’s more about 80% of U.S. electric load is in coastal or Great Lakes states near offshore wind resources.

“We’ve significantly increased our workforce here in the U.S. and that’s in direct response to the potential here” Urbish said. “The U.S. is a key market for Ørsted at this point.”

New Jersey just announced a new 11000 megawatt offshore wind target the largest in the country. Virginia’s Dominion Energy is pushing to get its 2600 megawatt commercial project finished by 2026 and the state wants a total of 5200 megawatts by 2034. Maryland has approved more than 2000 megawatts of offshore wind capacity. North Carolina has a goal of 8000 megawatts by 2040.

Massachusetts is contracting for 5600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. Maine says its initial goal of 5000 megawatts by 2030 is “not realistic at this point” but still considers offshore wind “one of our state’s largest untapped clean energy resources.” Louisiana with a large skilled offshore oil and gas workforce that is partially repositioning for offshore wind aims for 5000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035 in its most recent climate plan.

And the new federal Inflation Reduction Act undoes a Trump administration moratorium on federal offshore wind leases in the Southeast potentially opening up new opportunities for Georgia the Carolinas and Florida though the Sunshine State’s potential is seen as limited because of a lack of strong sustained winds near the coast.

However getting all that power to electric consumers will require billions in upgrades to the electric grid and a whole lot better regional planning by states and grid operators experts say.

“Offshore wind is big” said Simon Mahan executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association a trade group for large renewable energy and energy storage companies. “When you bring it ashore it’s gonna have an effect on nearby generation regardless of market structure. They’re the size of nuclear reactors. … So it’s really important to do good studies.”

‘A big job’

Until fairly recently renewable energy advocates say there’s been less emphasis by policymakers and grid managers on transmission infrastructure upgrades and the comprehensive regional planning needed to make mass offshore wind a reality though the federal government and states are starting to come to grips with the scope of the problem.

“There needs to be a lot more done than what’s being done right now and people are starting to realize that” said Walt Musial principal engineer and offshore wind platform lead at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “The integration of this is going to be a big job and something we have to start working on soon. These transmission projects can take longer to build than the plants themselves.”

With relatively small stand-alone wind projects it’s often feasible for developers to find their own solutions to interconnection said Mike Jacobs a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists who focuses on renewable energy and the electric grid. Indeed wind developers with projects farther along in the pipeline can take advantage of old thermal generation sites — like Ørsted plans to do with the former B.L. England coal-fired power plant in Upper Township New Jersey south of Atlantic City — as points of interconnection because of the existing grid infrastructure there.

But with the potential scale of American offshore wind energy and the huge targets proposed by states like New Jersey project-by-project transmission solutions won’t work Jacobs said.

“Now you talk about 1000 megawatts at a time. And New Jersey wants 10 of those. The transmission needed to be upscaled on shore is significant and needs to reach further inland” he said. “The cable you brought to the nearest connection point from water to land is going to run into something that’s going to be inadequate and needs to be upscaled.”

In Maryland it isn’t clear yet where the electric cables from the two pending offshore wind projects will land onshore — though both developers are looking at locations in Delaware to connect the transmission lines to the grid.

‘Better than nothing’

That means billions of dollars in upgrades that will be necessary to accommodate the offshore wind buildout contemplated by state and federal leaders and debates about planning and cost allocation involving regional transmission operators which run much of the U.S. electric grid. In Virginia Dominion Energy the state’s largest utility estimates the transmission upgrades required as part of its $10 billion 2640 megawatt wind installation will be about 16% to 17% of the total project cost a company spokesman said.

PJM Interconnection which runs the electric grid in all or parts of Maryland Delaware Illinois Indiana Kentucky Michigan New Jersey North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Tennessee Virginia West Virginia and the District of Columbia estimated that injecting offshore wind generation (it studied scenarios ranging from 6416 megawatts up to 17016 megawatts) into the existing onshore transmission system as well as meeting other renewable energy goals of the states it serves would require anywhere from $627 million in a short-term scenario to as much as $3.2 billion in long-term scenarios per a study released last year. That study only examined upgrades that would be necessary to existing infrastructure not any “sea-to-shore or any offshore transmission networks.”

“They do require a fair amount of upgrades to the traditional land based transmission system” said Ray DePillo director of development for offshore wind for PSE&G New Jersey’s largest utility. “That’s a lot of megawatts to put into a single point or multiple points into the transmission system.”

PSE&G has partnered with Ørsted on Coastal Wind Link a series of offshore stations that will connect multiple wind farms to the grid at a single onshore point rather than having every offshore wind farm connect using its own cable.

That proposal is among a series of transmission bids New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities will consider under a deal it reached with PJM Interconnection. Generally PJM would be responsible for planning transmission upgrades and allocating costs to accommodate individual offshore wind generation projects as part of the interconnection process.

But with a giant backlog in PJM’s interconnection queue driven by a flood of new renewable projects and an interconnection review overhaul underway New Jersey and PJM negotiated the State Agreement Approach which “enables a state or group of states to propose a project to assist in realizing state public policy requirements as long as the state (or states) agrees to pay all costs of any state-selected build-out.” PJM in turn has run a solicitation for transmission bids on the state’s behalf in coordination with the N.J. Board of Public Utilities. It received more than 80 proposals ranging in cost from $1.2 billion to more than $7 billion depending on various scenarios PJM said though those costs don’t necessarily include onshore upgrades. The board will ultimately decide what gets built.

“New Jersey came to realize that if they wanted to do this large and fast they had to take the matter into hand” Jacobs said.

In short New Jersey ratepayers will shoulder the cost of the transmission upgrades themselves even though those grid improvements may have broader benefits for reliability beyond the state’s borders.

“This is a good news and bad news story” Jacobs said. “The benefits from New Jersey doing this will flow beyond New Jersey. … What we’re doing is having the states fill a gap that was not expected and should not need to be done.”

Rob Gramlich founder and president of Grid Strategies a consulting firm called the solution “highly suboptimal.”

“But I agree with New Jersey that although it’s suboptimal it’s better than nothing” he said.

At the heart of the friction is the traditional guiding principle of interconnection that new generators should pay for the transmission upgrades necessary to connect them to the grid because grid managers like PJM haven’t generally looked for broader benefits to the system critics say.

That model was tolerable when the new generators were large gas power plants that could be sited close to existing interconnection points and high voltage lines but not so much now with hundreds of smaller more diffuse solar and wind projects that are trying to connect to the grid Gramlich added.

“The flaws of that system are now quite evident to everybody” he said.

Tackling transmission

A new proposed rule by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aims to better quantify the broader benefits of transmission upgrades which some renewable energy proponents say could grease the wheels for the buildout required to decarbonize the grid. And the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act includes $100 million specifically earmarked for offshore wind transmission planning modeling and analysis.

“The fact of the matter is we need more studies we don’t know what we don’t know” said Mahan of the Southern Renewable Energy Association. “The IRA funding is there to help solve some of this problem.”

There are ongoing studies as well.

Melinda Marquis offshore wind grid integration lead at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory is leading a Department of Energy study expected to be finished next year that will identify the optimal interconnection points along the Atlantic coast. It’s one of several seeking answers to how best to incorporate offshore wind into the grid Marquis said and states like New York which is pushing for 9000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035 have done their own studies.

“The way offshore has been deployed in the North Sea in England for instance is the same way the very early offshore wind plants in the U.S. are developing. That is where each offshore wind plant builds one radial connection to shore. … So each developer is picking the cheapest best place to inject the power” Marquis said. “There’s a limited number of points of interconnection along the Atlantic.”

Right now there aren’t many incentives for developers to share interconnection and transmission infrastructure Marquis said. Her group’s study will quantify costs under various build-out scenarios compare different transmission technologies explore implications for grid reliability and examine effects on marine life and fisheries.

“The ocean is really a pretty crowded place” she said adding that the study is incorporating data on marine sanctuaries national wildlife refuges reefs sea floor sediment shipping lanes fishing grounds and military areas among others.

“We hope that the results of our study will be very helpful for the people who make decisions about the way transmission is expanded how it is built and we hope this will lead to a very resilient reliable grid with a very low cost to the ratepayer that minimizes impact on marine species and the marine environment” Marquis said.

She noted that representatives from major U.S. utilities and grid operators are participating in the study.

“The Department of Energy really understands this and they’re funding us to tackle this” she said.

‘All of the above’

Meanwhile similar to New Jersey other states are realizing the importance of taking the lead on transmission planning. New York wants offshore wind projects connecting to shore to be “meshed ready” which means being able to share sea-to-shore connection infrastructure among different offshore wind plants rather than each one having a separate connection to shore. PJM says it’s talking with other states about how to upgrade transmission to meet their energy goals.

“We have had exploratory discussions with our states to pursue similar goals like NJ but nothing formalized yet” Ken Seiler vice president of planning said last month adding that the grid operator is at work on the second phase of a regional wind study “meant to identify regional transmission solutions to offshore wind and all other renewable portfolio development planned for by the states.”

PJM’s counterpart in the middle of the country MISO which covers an area stretching from Minnesota to Louisiana says its transmission planning has been all land-based and there are no offshore wind projects in its interconnection queue.

“However MISO is equipped to study and evaluate any offshore projects that may be submitted in the future” Brandon Morris a spokesman for the organization said.

And last month five New England states issued a joint “request for information” seeking comments from offshore wind developers the electric transmission industry and others “regarding changes and upgrades to the regional electric transmission system needed to integrate renewable energy resources including but not limited to offshore wind resources as well as significant other new renewable resources” into the grid.

“I think this happens with all of the above to use an energy cliche” said Jacobs. “We will have some of the developers go ahead because they’re impatient and find the opportunities to build their own connections. We will have an institutional approach where we get the federal government and the regional operators to do what they are mandated already to do which is plan for a reliable consumer friendly open access system. All this will happen because the states will present a credible threat to these institutions that are supposed to be doing it in the first place.”

Josh Kurtz contributed to this report.

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify the costs of upgrading the PJM transmission system to accommodate offshore wind as identified in a 2021 report by the grid operator. The cost estimates included other renewable energy goals by states not just offshore wind.

This will mean that alongside other information they will be required to file their profit and loss (P&L) accounts [1].

While more small businesses than ever are producing P&L statements for members this change will make the practice universal among businesses. But compiling P&L statements is more than just an administrative task it is an important step in setting or adjusting your business strategy.

In this article we’ll look at how businesses are using their P&L accounts to help drive smarter business strategy that increases profits and helps drive growth.

Why SMEs need a profit and loss statement

In the UK all registered companies with a turnover of more than £10.2 million and a balance sheet of more than £5.1 million are legally required to file annual accounts with Companies House that include a balance sheet directors’ report and P&L account. Companies House recently announced that it will change the rules to include businesses that fall under the threshold in the legal requirement [2].

A profit and loss account is a financial statement that outlines a company’s revenues expenses and profits over a specific period of time usually a quarter or financial year. It is important because it provides an overview of your company’s financial health and profitability.

According to Neil Hutchings director of corporate finance with Albert Goodman they can also be vital in other ways. “They allow you to see changing trends around margins demand pricing and revenue” he says.

Understanding your P&L account

The main items captured in your company’s P&L account are listed below.

Sales and revenues

This captures any income generated by your company through selling products or services but might also include revenue from investments interest or affiliated companies. “If your P&L shows an increase in sales of a particular product or service this could help you to change strategy to increase prices without necessarily becoming uncompetitive” says Hutchings.

Operating costs

This will generally list costs in your accounts by broad category. Tracking this part of the P&L account helps business owners to understand where costs are rising or falling and how those changes affect operating profits.

“P&L accounts can be whatever you want them to be"" says Hutchings. ""Although you’ll submit an abbreviated version to Companies House your own P&L account can drill down into whatever categories and details are useful to you in making strategy.”

Common cost categories listed under operating costs on a P&L account will include:

Cost of goods sold: raw materials shipping and other costs involved in selling your product or service.

Office and administrative costs: stationery postage office equipment technology.

Overheads: this can include utilities and rent.

Payroll: your P&L account might break down expenses for contractors and freelance staff.

Loans and interest: if your business makes payments to loan accounts these will usually be listed in the P&L account.

Operating profit

The P&L account will deduct expenses from revenues to show the business’ operating profit before taxes (these will be listed separately). Understanding operating profit is vital to gauging the health of your business and to spot potential dips in profit that could affect the company’s ability to function.

What you can learn from a P&L account

By tracking your P&L account over a period of multiple months or quarters business owners can track trends over time. For example is a dip in profits just a normal seasonal variation or a sign that your marketing strategy isn’t delivering?

P&L accounts can also be a useful way to benchmark your company’s performance against industry averages. By comparing P&L forecasts against the actual results of other companies businesses can identify areas they might need to improve or focus on. For example is the business spending too much on overheads compared to other businesses in the sector? Does this suggest a need to reduce energy consumption or move to cheaper premises?

Ben Austin CEO of digital marketing agency Absolute Digital Media finds this benchmarking exercise hugely valuable. ""If one of our costs starts to spiral outside of industry norms it’s a sign to look at whether we need to renegotiate terms or look at whether we need that particular product” he says.

Your P&L account is also an important document when approaching potential partners investors or buyers of your business. “If you’re talking to potential investors or looking to raise cash to help your business grow then you need to be able to show that you have good profit margins that your growth is increasing on a particular curve and you’re investing enough to keep your business competitive” says Hutchings.

How to use your P&L account to make smart decisions

To really make the most of your P&L accounts it’s important to check them regularly.

“Our P&L account is generated quarterly but we’re pulling reports and looking at P&L at least monthly if not daily"" says Austin.

Absolute Digital Media holds a monthly finance meeting attended by the CEO finance manager and finance director. “We look at the P&L accounts and see whether our budget forecasts are realistic in light of those numbers” says Austin. “We work in an industry where things can change very rapidly and a client might pull a budget or we might pick up new clients. Our P&L tracks that and those monthly meetings are an opportunity to see if we need to adjust our annual forecast for spending on things like marketing recruitment or software platforms.”

When the P&L accounts show that revenues are falling this is the sign for Austin and his departmental heads to review strategies.

“As a small company we’re always looking to identify ways that we might improve profitability and where our costs might be increasing in ways we can mitigate” he adds. ""The bank account can be really misleading if we’ve just taken a big payment on an account. The P&L account is a much more useful way to set strategy.”

P&L accounts can also identify when it’s a good time to invest. Several years ago Austin’s team was approached by a potential new customer looking for a number of services including some that Absolute Digital Media didn’t offer. “Because we were constantly tracking P&L we could see that we had a bump in revenue over the usual"" says Austin.

""We felt more confident investing in building those new services and that allowed us to then sign a substantial contract with the customer.”

View the current offers here.

Many years ago there was really only one major rewards credit card that cost more than around $100 per year — and that was the ubiquitous Platinum Card® from American Express. If you wanted to get into a Centurion Lounge — which at the time was in a league of its own — you didn't leave home without it.

But that was then. Now many rewards credit cards cost several hundred dollars per year and one cobranded Marriott credit card the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card just bumped up its annual fee from an already-high $450 per year to a somewhat jaw-dropping $650 per year (see rates and fees).

But here's potentially the even crazier part than the $200 increase for a hotel credit card — now I want the card even more.

And no this is not because of some weird and deranged desire to have the most premium of credit cards in my wallet. It's because it would now save me more money than it ever could have before.

Here's how that math works out — and why I now really want to get my hands on the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant.

Instant Marriott Platinum status

I travel a lot but with a largely remote job two kids a spouse a dog and a cat back home I don't live for months of the year on the road. This makes keeping top-tier elite status in multiple programs somewhere between a stretch and an impossibility. It was simpler during the heart of the pandemic as qualification criteria were relaxed but as that phase is ending it's become tough once again.

On paper Marriott requires eligible 50 nights in a hotel per year to earn and maintain Platinum status. But there are ways to reduce that true number down such as by getting a 15- to 25-night head-start on elite status by having a personal Marriott card such as the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Card — and potentially another 15 elite nights credited by holding a small-business card such as the Marriott Bonvoy Business® American Express®.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

I've currently got a couple of Marriott credit cards — but both are of the small-business variety so I only get 15 nights per year credited out of the 50 I need. It's October already and I'm currently just at 30 nights out of 50 needed for 2022 receiving 15 nights from one of my cards and the other 15 from paid stays. Frankly I'm not sure how I'm going to close the gap fully without wasting money (or points) and time on stays I don't really need. But because I can't pull myself off the status hamster wheel odds are high I'll try and find a way if I have to.

However if I was able to add the Bonvoy Brilliant to my arsenal my Marriott elite status work would be done — not just for this year — but every year.

TPG values Marriott Platinum status at $2475. I'm not sure that's my own personal valuation based on my travel patterns but I'd say I get well over $1000 in tangible value out of having the status every year between the additional points earned on paid stays the breakfast benefit lounge access and suite upgrades.

Here's an entire article I wrote on why I want to keep Marriott Platinum status for as long as possible.

While Marriott Platinum status admittedly doesn't matter much at a random Fairfield Inn it makes a whole lot of difference somewhere like the St. Regis New York the Autograph Collection property in Vail or even the Swan Reserve at Walt Disney World. And while I don't have those higher-end Marriott stays all the time I do usually have a few a year where status makes a big difference in terms of breakfast amenities and suites.

SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Frankly because I know I'll get my money back from the elite benefits the Platinum status alone would be worth a $650 fee without worrying about earning it.

Value to me: $1000.

$300 in dining credits

It's true that $650 is a whole lot of cash each year for one credit card — even if it does unlock Platinum perks.

Fortunately it isn't really that high of a true cost if you use the built-in $300 in dining credits. While these are perhaps not quite as easy to use as the former $300 in Marriott credits that could be used all at once we all still have to eat and as long as you have a system to remember to spend $25 on dining each month on the card it drops the true out-of-pocket cost from $650 to $350.

My trick to using these sorts of monthly dining credits is to load our Chick-fil-A app with $25 each month at the beginning of the month. Then when it's our turn to get the nugget tray for school parties or we just are craving some Chick-n-Minis we are good to go.

You could presumably do it with Starbucks too if that's more your jam. Or just remember to use the card when you go out to eat.

Value to me: $300.

An annual night worth 85000 points

Another perk that makes me really want the revamped Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card more than ever is the annual award night which is now worth 85000 points (instead of the previous 50000 points). Of course it's also true that Marriott's program is now charging more for some properties than it used to so you probably need the higher-value certificate just to book what you want in some cases.

Be that as it may I'd love to get my hands on a Marriott 85000-point certificate. Since you can add up to 15000 Marriott points to a certificate you can pick from most Marriott properties around the world that cost up to 100000 points with the certificate and a ""top off.""

RITZ-CARLTON NOMAD

I'd try to find nights where I could use the certificate at a hotel such as the new Ritz-Carlton New York NoMad which otherwise would be well out of my price league at $1500 or more most nights. I'd say that's more than getting your money's worth if you can cash in for something like that. (Even though Ritz-Carlton is quite weak when it comes to Marriott Platinum perks.)

Value to me: $400.

150000 bonus Marriott points

Last but certainly not least if you get the Amex Bonvoy Brilliant card before Jan. 11 2023 you can also get a 150000-point Marriott welcome bonus as long as you spend $5000 on the card in the first three months. That's a nice shot of points that can be used in an almost endless number of ways.

I'd probably earmark them for either an eventual (fingers-crossed) one-day blowout return to the Maldives or similar for a big round number birthday ... or use them in a bit more practical fashion for several nights on a Disney trip with a stay at the Walt Disney World Swan Dolphin or Swan Reserve hotels. There's really no wrong way to use welcome bonus points.

CHRIS DONG/THE POINTS GUY

I've recently bought Marriott points at 0.83 cents each so I think the TPG valuation of 0.84 cents each is about right on the money for this one.

Value to me: $1260.

Bottom line

Being pretty realistic about what these perks are worth now on the Bonvoy Brilliant I think I'd easily get over $2900 in value from having this card in the first year including the welcome bonus points. I'd also say ""thank you very much"" for the 150000 bonus points although that honestly wouldn't be the main reason for me to get the card since it's a one-and-done opportunity.

I'd be keeping the card for the $1700 in ongoing real-world value I assign to the benefits other than the welcome bonus. Just not having to worry about how I'd hit Marriott Platinum status each year would be a treat.

So yeah it probably sounds crazy at first glance but as soon as I'm in a position to apply for my next credit card I'd love it if I were able to get the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant. Yes the fee is higher than ever — by a lot. But at least for me it's also a better overall deal than ever before.

The World Economic Forum is an independent not-for-profit organisation committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business political academic and other leaders to shape global regional and industry agendas.

Amex GBT’s initial participation will focus on the development of sustainable travel initiatives through the Forum’s Mobility Platform.

“Travel is a force for good. It is the engine room of the global economy driving trade and growth. It drives social progress by bringing people together – connecting communities helping to bring down barriers and build respect and understanding. For the world to continue enjoying these benefits we must address the impact of travel-related carbon emissions on the environment” said Paul Abbott CEO of Amex GBT.

Creating a greener airspace for the future

One area of Amex GBT's key areas of focus in the forum will be the Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative which aims to accelerate use of sustainable aviation fuel stimulating demand and lowering the price differential with traditional jet fuels.

The travel management company last summer announced it was working with Accenture and Shell on a blockchain-based platform for SAF purchasing and both Accenture and Shell also are mobility platform partners in the WEF.

Other areas of focus for Amex GBT include the First Movers Coalition a public-private partnership that includes the U.S. State Department and several other countries and companies working to create demand for clean technologies in industries with high carbon emissions; and Target True Zero which is working to promote deployment of hydrogen- and electricity-fueled aviation technologies.

“Governments and companies must therefore work together to tackle this challenge head on. The World Economic Forum can bring the right people to the table.

American Express National Bank Member FDIC began in 1850 as a freight forwarding company and slowly transitioned into the financial market while maintaining a reputation of trust and commitment with its customers.

Many of the company’s credit card offerings are specifically designed for balance transfers giving Card Members access to promotional interest rates for periods ranging from 12 to 15 months.

As Federal Reserve interest rate hikes lead to higher interest charges options for reducing credit card interest rates are quickly becoming more appealing.

What Is an American Express Balance Transfer?

A balance transfer is the process of transferring a credit card balance from one card to another essentially using one credit card account with more appealing terms to pay off another account to save money in the long run.

An American Express balance transfer is the same but it specifically entails paying off debt held at outside lenders using an American Express® credit card. Card Members cannot transfer a balance from one American Express account to another.

How To Do an American Express Balance Transfer

American Express offers balance transfers for new and existing customers. Those interested in transferring a balance to the lender should follow the steps below.

How To Do a Balance Transfer to a New American Express Card For those who don’t have an American Express credit card or have one that doesn’t offer balance transfer capabilities the best option is to apply for a new card specifically designed for this feature and transfer balances during the application. Here’s how it’s done: Compare Options. American Express offers various credit cards with promotional periods for balance transfers. However each comes with a different promotional period fee structure and rewards program. Be sure to find the option that’s the best fit for you. Click “Apply Now.” Navigate to the blue “Apply Now” button below the balance transfer offer you’re interested in. Fill Out the Application Accurately. Be sure that everything on the application is accurate. Provide Balance Transfer Details. Provide the details of the balances you’re interested in transferring on the application. If your application is approved American Express will automatically move forward with the transfers.

How To Do a Balance Transfer to an Existing American Express Credit Card Existing American Express® Card Members may enjoy promotional interest rates when they transfer balances to their accounts. Here are the steps to doing so: Log In Online. Begin by logging into your online account management dashboard. Check Eligibility. If a balance transfer offer is available American Express will clarify that information in the account management dashboard including availability and terms. Request a Transfer. If a balance transfer is available you should follow your online account management dashboard steps to tell American Express which balances you’d like to transfer.

Keep in mind that most American Express balance transfers take between five and seven business days to complete the process. However in some cases the transaction may take up to six weeks to complete. It’s important for borrowers to continue making payments on their existing cards until their transfers are complete to avoid any late payment fees or damage to their credit scores.

What Happens After a Cardholder Requests a Balance Transfer?

When a Card Member requests a balance transfer from American Express the lender reviews the application to determine the customer’s eligibility. If the Card Member is eligible for the transfer American Express pays off balances with outside financial institutions and adds them to the current balance on the Card Member’s account plus any applicable transfer fees.

The company typically charges a balance transfer fee amounting to $5 or 3% of the transaction amount whichever is greater.

Things To Know Before You Transfer Balances

Balance transfers and the 0% interest rates they typically come with are enticing but there are a few things to consider before taking advantage of this type of transaction:

Pay attention to the length of the promotional period which can vary wildly from one offer to the next. Any remaining balance associated with the balance transfer will be charged the standard rate of interest when the promotional period expires so you should compare your card’s standard interest rates to balance transfer offers especially if you don’t think you can pay the balance off entirely during the promotional period. Balance transfer fees at American Express are typically 3% of the transaction amount or $5 whichever is greater.

Final Take

An American Express balance transfer can make it easier to pay down debt thanks to promotional interest rates. Borrowers should strongly consider comparing offers today to avoid the increasing cost of rising interest rates.

The case highlights what the United Nations and others describe as a rising tide of young men and women being lured into — and trapped in — brutal online scam operations across the Mekong region of Southeast Asia.

The Malaysian International Humanitarian Organization says the number of nationals stuck in Laos is based on reports from some of the trapped victims it and two other Malaysian rights groups have been in contact with by phone and text over the past few months plus a few who have managed to escape or negotiate their release.

“They’ve been tortured mentally and physically” the group’s secretary-general Hishamuddin Hashim told VOA.

Hishamuddin said the victims are typically lured to Laos with social media ads for well-paid IT or casino jobs only to be lockup up on arrival and forced to run a range of online love and investment scams on targets across the region and around the world depending on their language skills. He said the victims report being watched around the clock by guards posted throughout the fenced-off compounds including some with guns on the ground floors.

“If they don’t want to work they will be beaten.... Some of them [have] been electrocuted … by electric shock” he added all “to force and to punish those who cannot achieve the target and those who want to return back to [their] home country.”

Besides forcing the victims to cheat unwitting targets out of their money Hishamuddin added some of the criminal syndicates are demanding ransoms ranging from $50000 to $100000 from the trapped workers’ families for their release. He said the Malaysian government refuses to pay the ransoms as a matter of policy though he knows a few families that have paid partial deposits on demanded sums only to then lose contact with their children and their captors.

Hishamuddin said the rights groups have passed what they know onto Malaysian authorities which have been in contact with their counterparts in Laos.

Malaysian authorities did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment and a spokesman for the Lao government refused to be interviewed.

Hishamuddin said the Malaysians are trapped in compounds across Laos. While the victims don’t always know exactly where in Laos they are he estimates that about half of them are likely being held inside the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in the country’s northwest on the border with eastern Myanmar and northern Thailand.

The Golden Triangle SEZ has been an alleged hotbed of transnational organized crime for years. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the man who runs it Chinese national Zhao Wei in 2018 placing him at the heart of a crime network laundering money for Myanmar drug lords and trafficking in everything from drugs to wildlife and people.

Zone officials did not reply to VOA’s requests for an interview but Zhao has previously denied the allegations.

The Golden Triangle SEZ also gets repeated mention in the U.S. State Department’s latest Trafficking in Persons report released in July. It says Lao authorities helped repatriate dozens of foreign nationals being forced to work inside the zone in 2021 and launched a special investigation into labor trafficking there early this year.

Winrock International however a U.S.-based aid group that runs development projects around the globe says the Anti-Trafficking Department of the Lao government’s Ministry of Public Security is still debating whether to even post police officers at the zone.

“Things go slow here” the head of Winrock’s anti-trafficking projects in Laos Xoukiet Panyanounvong told VOA.

Hishamuddin whose group works specifically on migrant labor and trafficking issues said he had heard reports of Malaysians trapped in Laos before but never as many as 700 at once.

The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime a non-government research group based in Switzerland says the figure is plausible.

Lindsey Kennedy a consultant for the Global Initiative told VOA that the group’s researchers visited the Golden Triangle zone in May and believe thousands of people were being held against their will inside a single compound they found there.

“Volunteer rescue organizations have also told us that there are many similar options [operations] throughout the country including in Vientiane” she added citing the Lao capital. “It is unclear how many of the people trapped are Malaysians but a significant number of Malaysian people have been previously discovered at identical scam centers in Cambodia and Myanmar.”

These scam centers have been around for years but Kennedy said they mushroomed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her group estimates they’ve now ensnared tens of thousands of young men and women across the Mekong region. Cambodia recently started cracking down but Kennedy said it remains to be seen whether that will drive the criminal groups that run them out of business or merely out of the country to elsewhere including Laos. Her group’s research has found some of the same people behind multiple special economic zones and casino towns hosting these centers in Cambodia Laos Myanmar and the Philippines.

Researchers and rights groups are convinced the trafficking could not be happening without government corruption.

Despite the U.S. sanctions Zhao is pouring millions of dollars into expanding the Golden Triangle zone with the Lao government’s blessing. On October 1 the government even awarded him the state’s “Medal of Bravery Second Class” for “his efforts and contribution to national defense and national public security” local media reported.

“His continued operations do tend to suggest that he operates with political protection” Kennedy said.

“There must be some people on higher level benefit from this” Hishamuddin agreed. “These criminal people they cannot do this without support by high-level authorities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtlbm5lZHkuc2VuYXRlLmdvdi9wdWJsaWMvMjAyMi8xMC9rZW5uZWR5LWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLWV4cGVydHMtZnJvbS1hcm91bmQtdGhlLWdsb2JlLWluLW5ldy1vcmxlYW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kennedy addresses environmental experts from around the globe in New Orleans,"NEW ORLEANS – Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) today addressed environmental and health experts from around the globe at the 42nd International Symposium on Halogenated Persistent Organic Pollutants in New Orleans. The group of scientists meets annually to discuss environmental pollution methods of pollution prevention human exposure and the health effects of pollutants among other topics.

The Louisiana State University (LSU) Superfund Research Program hosted the event in the U.S. for the first time in more than a decade.

“I am proud to welcome scientists and researchers from around the world to Louisiana as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act starts to do its work protecting our jobs and environment” said Kennedy.

Background:

Kennedy led the effort to pass the AIM Act into law with overwhelming bipartisan support. The law helps U.S. industry transition away from hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and drives more investments in American-made next-generation coolants that are better for the environment cheaper for consumers and good for the economy.

The AIM Act is expected to create 150000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs including 33000 new manufacturing jobs in places like Louisiana. This will also help protect the more than 1.3 million jobs in the heating ventilation air-conditioning and refrigeration sector.

American companies have been at the forefront of developing HFC alternatives for years and the AIM Act helps promote U.S. leadership in the innovation and manufacturing of these products.

Using these next-generation coolants is also expected to save American businesses and consumers billions of dollars in energy costs over the next 10 years. This would cut costs for Americans during historic inflation pressures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVGVjaG5vbG9neS9jeWJlcmF0dGFja3MtcmVwb3J0ZWQtdXMtYWlycG9ydHMvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTEyODc5NjXSAVlodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9UZWNobm9sb2d5L2N5YmVyYXR0YWNrcy1yZXBvcnRlZC11cy1haXJwb3J0cy9zdG9yeT9pZD05MTI4Nzk2NQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyberattacks reported at US airports,"The attacker was within the Russian Federation according to a senior official.

Some of the nation's largest airports have been targeted for cyberattacks Monday by an attacker within the Russian Federation a senior official briefed on the situation confirmed to ABC News.

Importantly the systems targeted do not handle air traffic control internal airline communications and coordination or transportation security.

""It's an inconvenience"" the source said. The attacks have resulted in targeted ""denial of public access"" to public-facing web domains that report airport wait times and congestion.

Over a dozen airport websites were impacted by the ""denial of service"" attack John Hultquist head of intelligence analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant told ABC News. That type of attack essentially overloads sites by jamming them with artificial users.

""Killnet"" a pro-Russian hacker group is believed to be behind the attack according to Hultquist. While similar groups have been found to be fronts for state-backed actors Hultquist said there is no evidence the Russian government was involved in directing this attack.

The attacks were first reported around 3 a.m. ET when the Port Authority notified the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that the LaGuardia Airport system had been hit. LaGuardia has been restored but other airports around the country have subsequently been targeted.

The FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency part of the Department of Homeland Security each said they were aware of the attacks.

The websites for Des Moines International Airport Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Chicago O'Hare International Airport appeared impacted Monday morning.

Later Monday Denver International Airport the third busiest airport in the country was attacked and continues to be attacked according to an airport spokesperson.

""Similar to many other U.S. airports DEN’s website has been targeted"" the spokesperson told ABC News. ""The attacks began around 11 a.m. this morning and they continue. The attackers are attempting to overwhelm our website so that it becomes unavailable to the public.""

""At this time the attacks have not been impactful though we are closely monitoring these attacks and any others. We are also sharing information on these attacks with TSA CISA and other airports"" the spokesperson added.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport reported around 10:30 a.m. ET that its site is back up and running and that ""at no time were operations at the airport impacted.""

""Early this morning the FlyLAX.com website was partially disrupted"" LAX said in a statement to ABC News. ""The service interruption was limited to portions of the public facing FlyLAX.com website only. No internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions.""

LAX said its website was back up and running a little before 1 p.m. ET.

The group ""Killnet"" has been active since the beginning of the war in Ukraine targeting Ukrainian allies and recently claiming credit for taking down government websites in the U.S. They operate internationally and have been known to carry out attacks across Europe according to cybersecurity experts.

In this file photo taken on Aug. 10 2022 passengers look at flight departure information boards in the West Gates expansion area at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images FILE

Engineers and programmers are actively working to close backdoors that allowed the attacks and shoring up more critical computer infrastructure.

Jamming attacks like the one seen Monday morning are highly visible but largely superficial and often temporary Hultquist said.

""We are pretty clear it's a Russian cyber group that claimed responsibility"" Sen. Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. said Monday going on to connect the attacks to the Ukrainian bombing of a bridge in Crimea over the weekend. ""We are asking our authorities to confirm who did it and then take the appropriate strong action so the Russians know they cannot get away with this. Putin has a lot of nerve after his brutal vicious war against the Ukrainian people to now say he has the right to retaliate because they protected themselves with a bridge is outrageous.""

The system is an advanced force protection measure advertised as quick to relocate set up and scuttle.

“This system was built to be truly expeditionary so it can move with forces on the move” Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose told Defense News ahead of the company’s announcement.

“It is a trailerized version that can be set up very quickly ... but from the time that it is operating it’s providing a fully autonomous bubble of protection around that force” he added.

The original Sentry uses Anduril’s Lattice artificial intelligence software and a variety of radars and electro-optical infrared and radio frequency sensors to identify detect and track objects ― and then pass that data to command-and-control nodes. Brose said Sentry can detect drones of varying sizes from small quadcopters to large fixed-wing aircraft.

According to the company Mobile Sentry can be positioned set up and made ready in less than 20 minutes by one operator with no specialized training or support. It can operate for 100 hours on a full tank of diesel or jet fuel.

The new system uses a ruggedized trailer Brose said is easily towable even while off road behind a military vehicle or a commercial pickup truck. It fits inside a C-17 or C-130 aircraft and can be carried inside or sling-loaded by a CH-47 heavy-lift helicopter.

Anduril began supplying the stationary towers in 2020 to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the southern border. For Mobile Sentry the company envisions the Army Marine Corps special operations forces and elements of the Air Force as potential customers.

It “meets the need that the force has right now in terms of something that is highly expeditionary just highly modular very open” Brose said. “These are the kinds of things that we hear directly from the United States Army that they need both now and in the future ― a platform on which you can build and upgrade.”

Like the original it’s marketed as customizable with a variety of sensors payloads and communications components for autonomous security and countering drones at forward-deployed military bases borders oil and gas fields or other critical infrastructure. The heart of the system is its Lattice software.

Mobile Sentry wouldn’t be the only American-made vehicle-mounted surveillance system to launch this year. Teledyne FLIR Defense unveiled its Lightweight Vehicle Surveillance System in February which also advertises a counter-drone capability.

AWK has announced that its unit New Jersey American Water will invest $10 million to replace nearly 4 miles of aging water mains in the Leonardo section of Middletown NJ.



New Jersey American Water will replace the old water mains installed during the 1930s with new 6- and 8-inch ductile iron mains. The proper upgrade and maintenance of water mains will ensure an adequate potable water supply for its customers.



The company has been upgrading and maintaining its water and wastewater infrastructure methodically by replacing old water mains. It plans to remove all aging lead and galvanized service lines by 2031 and provide high-quality services to 2.8 million people in the state.

Aging Infrastructure – A Concern

Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. Per the ASCE finding due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance 2.1 trillion gallons of treated water is lost every year in the United States. It is evident from the findings of ASCE that a substantial portion of the U.S. water infrastructure has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. The repair and upgrade of miles of aging pipelines are essential to maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water services.



Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water pipelines and wastewater pipelines respectively to meet the demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure like overhead storage tanks and water purifying units needs maintenance at proper intervals.

Utilities Making Systematic Investment

Given the above-mentioned scenario it is evident that systematic investment to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure and make provisions for adding new infrastructure will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging water infrastructure.



American Water plans to invest $13-$14 billion between 2022 and 2026 and $28-$32 billion between 2022 and 2031 to upgrade and strengthen the existing water and wastewater infrastructure. Water utilities like California Water Service Group CWT Essential Utilities WTRG and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructures.



California Water Service has more than $1 billion in capital expenditure planned for 2022-2024. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CWT’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 14.3%. The current dividend yield of California Water Service is 1.9%. California Water Service currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).



Essential Utilities aims to invest $3 billion through 2024 to strengthen water and natural gas operations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG’s 2022 and 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 6.7% respectively. The long-term (three to five years) earnings growth of WTRG is currently pegged at 6.1%. The current dividend yield of Essential Utilities is 2.8%. Essential Utilities currently has a Zacks Rank #2.



Middlesex Water plans to invest $229 million during 2022-2024 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure to provide services to customers in a safe reliable and efficient manner. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSEX’s 2022 and 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 15.5% and 10.5% respectively. MSEX’s current dividend yield is 1.5%. Middlesex Water currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller sent a video alert to township residents early Saturday evening declaring: ""We have declared a state of emergency for Montclair ... prohibiting the non-essential use of water.""

Spiller said that the township has tapped into other municipalities' water supply lines to help meet Montclair's needs. Without doing so the mayor says the township would have run out of water at midnight Friday.

Montclair has connected with Cedar Grove Verona Clifton and New Jersey American Water Company.

Montclair has reached out to the Bergen County Office of the Emergency Management to supply water tankers in the event that the Montclair Fire Department has to battle a fire.

The township has also reached out for state and federal assistance.

""One of the biggest challenges and that we need your assistance with is water use reduction"" Spiller said.

""If any of the measures that we have taken or certainly any of the things we are trying to do fail the outcome would likely be a loss of water pressure resulting in a low pressure boil-water scenario a non-drinkable water declaration ... or just no water at all coming out of the water pipes"" Spiller said.

Spiller said that he has heard that there are has not been significant progress in fixing the water main break.

Glen Ridge disaster and emergency

Also on Saturday the Glen Ridge Emergency Management Coordinator Ann Marie Morrow released a proclamation of local disaster/emergency.

""The entire Borough of Glen Ridge shall be declared under a State of Emergency to avoid any non-essential use of water and shall use water only when absolutely necessary"" Murrow wrote in the proclamation.

Murrow noted that the borough is ""suffering a reduction in water supply and may suffer continued loss of water pressure"" as the New Jersey District Water Supply Commission works to repair ""a leak to its 72-inch aqueduct in Nutley.""

Bloomfield has boil-water advisory

Bloomfield also has a boil-water advisory — even if residents are not experiencing low pressure.

Residents who are experiencing full loss of water should notify the engineering department at 973-680-4009.

The investment supports American’s science based targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035 and ultimately its commitment to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. This investment makes American the first U.S. airline to make two direct investments focused on the development of both hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and the future of hydrogen distribution logistics.

Universal Hydrogen’s fuel distribution network uses modular hydrogen capsules that are handled like cargo eliminating the need for new fueling infrastructure at airports and speeding up fuel loading operations. Universal Hydrogen anticipates starting hydrogen deliveries for regional aircraft in 2025 with plans to expand its services to larger single aisle aircraft — first for auxiliary power in the late-2020s and then as a primary fuel by the mid-2030s. Because these segments represent two-thirds of aviation emissions — and with green hydrogen being a true zero-carbon fuel — these advances put aviation on a path to meet Paris Agreement emissions targets.

“This technology has the potential to be a game-changer on the industry’s path to zero-emission flight” said American’s Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr. “As the world’s largest airline American has a responsibility to exercise leadership in making aviation sustainable. Our investment in Universal Hydrogen represents a vote of confidence for green hydrogen as a key element of a sustainable future for our industry.”

American joins Airbus Ventures GE Aviation and Toyota Ventures as well as several major hydrogen producers and aircraft lessors as strategic investors in Universal Hydrogen.

“Together with our investors we are putting together the end-to-end value chain to make hydrogen aviation a near-term commercial reality” said Paul Eremenko co-founder and CEO of Universal Hydrogen. “This move by American is a strong signal that customers want a true zero-emissions solution for passenger aviation and are willing to back tangible pragmatic steps to get there quickly.”

Associated Press

RICHMOND Vt. — Residents of a small community in Vermont were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels  giving rise to worries about their children's dental health and transparent government — and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation.

Katie Mather who lives in Richmond a town of about 4100 in northwestern Vermont said at a water commission meeting this week that her dentist recently found her two kids' first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but noted that her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town's water should be doing the trick.

Her dentist ""was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met which they were not"" Mather said. ""It's the fact that we didn't have the opportunity to give our informed consent that gets to me.""

The addition of fluoride to public drinking water systems has been routine across the United States since the 1940s and 1950s but still doesn't sit well with some people and many countries don't fluoridate water for various reasons.

Critics argue that the health effects of fluoride aren't fully known and that its addition to municipal water can amount to an unwanted medication; some communities in recent years have ended the practice. In 2015 the U.S. government lowered its recommended amount in drinking water after some children got too much of it causing white splotches on their teeth.

While such splotches are primarily a cosmetic problem the American Dental Association notes on its website that fluoride — along with life-giving substances including salt iron and oxygen — can be toxic in large doses. But in the recommended amounts fluoride in water decreases cavities or tooth decay by about 25% according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which reported in 2018 that 73% of the U.S. population was served by water systems with adequate fluoride to protect teeth.

Town official explains his reasoning

Kendall Chamberlin Richmond's water and wastewater superintendent told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level nearly four years ago because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels.

He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China — an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years. And he said he doesn't think the state's recommended level of fluoride is warranted right now.

""My duty is to take reasonable care and judgment for the protection of public health safety and the environment of my customers"" he said adding that ""to err on the side of caution is not a bad position to be in.""

Chamberlin did not respond to an Associated Press email seeking comment.

Two of the three fluoride additives U.S. water systems can use do come from China because they have no domestic manufacturers but all are subject to stringent standards testing and certification to ensure safety CDC spokesperson Tracy Boehmer said in an email. Spokespeople for the Vermont Department of Health concurred that all additives must meet those national standards.

Chamberlin's decision flabbergasted residents and doctors.

""For a single person to unilaterally make the decision that this public health benefit might not be warranted is inappropriate. I think it's outrageous"" retired Dr. Allen Knowles said at the Sept. 19 meeting. ""Fluoride again is one of the most successful and important public health measures that has ever been undertaken in this country.""

Which states have the least amount of residents with fluoridated water?

Most water naturally contains some fluoride but typically not enough to prevent cavities. The mineral was first added to public water in Grand Rapids Michigan in 1945. Now it's commonplace although more prevalent in some states than others; Oregon New Jersey and Hawaii have the lowest percentage of residents with fluoridated water according to the United Health Foundation.

Fluoride is also added to toothpaste and other topical products and is in some foods.

In sparsely populated and largely rural Vermont 29 of the 465 public water systems voluntarily fluoridate and just over half of residents served by a public system get fluoridated water according to the Vermont Department of Health. The state's standard level is based on federal recommendations. Towns that fluoridate must maintain levels within the state's recommendations and submit monthly reports to the state Health Department.

Robin Miller the director of the Office of Oral Health said she didn't realize the town's fluoride number had been consistently low for so long until March this year. After a site visit by the state in April the levels did not improve so Miller contacted the Richmond town manager in June who requested she attend the meeting in September she said.

At the second meeting Monday Chamberlin – who doesn't live in town and appeared online – read a statement of apology.

""Words cannot express how sorry I am for causing this controversy"" he said. ""Believe me when I say I have always only had good intentions based on a misunderstanding. I promise I will make sure nothing like this ever happens again.""

Now under a partnership with Bayer the drug has snagged a global first-in-class nod in China.

Hua’s dorzagliatin is a glucokinase activator (GKA) and the Chinese green light ends a 10-year drought in Type 2 diabetes in terms of no medicines with new mechanisms of action entering the market the company said (PDF) Sunday. The drug is allowed for use either alone for new patients or in combination with metformin for treatment-experienced patients.

Through a 2020 deal Hua has teamed with Glucobay maker Bayer for local commercialization of dorzagliatin now bearing the brand name HuaTangNing. The company has also tapped state-owned Sinopharm for distribution. But heavy price cuts on older diabetes meds lack of a clear path to the U.S. and EU markets and competition from experienced players like Novo Nordisk have put a big question mark on dorzagliatin’s commercial potential.

Hua’s founder and CEO Li Chen Ph.D. brought dorzagliatin into the fold from Roche where he had worked for 18 years before building Hua around the GKA med. Glucokinase is a regulating sensor of blood glucose levels. The med attracted some investor heavyweights including ARCH Venture Partners whose co-founder Robert Nelsen is still Hua’s chairman.

But the GKA field has seen plenty of failures. These include another Roche candidate piragliatin which was terminated after phase 2 showed liver toxicity. AstraZeneca’s AZD1656 Amgen’s AMG 151 and Merck’s MK-0941 are other GKA meds that didn’t pass muster in clinical trials.

Related 10 biotechs to know in China

Dorzagliatin’s data from two phase 3 trials conducted in China also weren’t very impressive. The SEED trial showed dorzagliatin monotherapy lowered blood sugar levels as measured by HbA1c by 1.15% after 24 weeks of treatment versus 0.58% for the placebo group. In the DAWN study the dorzagliatin-metformin combo lowered Hb1Ac by 1.02% after 24 weeks versus 0.66% in the metformin control group. The magnitude of improvements was rather modest compared with drugs like Novo’s GLP-1 star med Ozempic.

Dorzagliatin’s approval comes as China has significantly squeezed the prices of older diabetes meds. In fact Bayer’s Glucobay—sold in the U.S. as Precose—was among the most severely hit by China’s price-cutting scheme. Sales of Glucobay plunged in 2020 after Bayer slashed its price by 90% to win supply contracts under China’s volume-based procurement program. What’s more Chinese authorities recently managed to get dozens of widely used insulin products to lower their prices by an average of 48%.

China represents a large diabetes market. The country had an estimated 140 million diabetes patients in 2021 half of whom were not diagnosed or treated according to Hua. But relatively small efficacy and the availability of cheap options could make commercial life hard for dorzagliatin despite additional marketing help from Bayer.

Still Hua seems heavily invested in dorzagliatin. Almost the company’s entire pipeline revolves around the GKA but those efforts remain in early-stage testing.

Under dorzagliatin’s development program there’s a clinical trial-enabling study for diabetic kidney disease early combination studies with Merck & Co.’s DPP-4 inhibitor Januvia Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s SGLT-2 med Jardiance and insulin. The company also looks to branch out of diabetes. Clinical trial-enabling studies are being conducted for dorzagliatin in combination with Takeda’s Actos in NASH and with a GLP-1 agent in Alzheimer’s disease.

It's coincidental that the order of Nplate made by pharmaceutical company Amgen comes just as Russian President Vladimir Putin is making nuclear threats say officials at the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On Monday morning Putin also ordered a series of missile strikes against at least 10 cities across Ukraine hitting the capital city of Kyiv and other areas far from the front line.

Despite these developments the U.S. purchase of Nplate is part of “long-standing ongoing efforts by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response to better prepare the U.S. for the potential health impacts of a wide range of threats to national security” according to an HHS news release.

The purchase is for about 50000 courses of the drug. That’s not enough if the United States were close to war with Russia NBC News reported.

""It isn’t that much product"" Chris Meekins former deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS told NBC News. “I would expect a bigger buy if this were in a response to something going on over there that requires them to both have enough for the U.S. and for giving to partners overseas.""

The drug must also be used within 24 hours of nuclear exposure making it not the ideal candidate for a widespread nuclear explosion Meekins added. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends people stay indoors for at least 24 hours after a nuclear event.

“We need products that can be used longer” Meekins said.

HHS has supported development of this drug since 2019. The agency did not say whether it made the order before or after Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.

Greg Burel former director of the Strategic National Stockpile said he didn’t think the order and the invasion were related.

Still President Joe Biden warned recently that the risk of nuclear “Armageddon” is at its highest since the Cuban missile crisis.

“Bottom line we are watching everything but this shouldn’t be used as a data point to assume there is a greater threat than people anticipate” Meekins said.

Released in early 2020 the Port is a newer and more versatile (and more expensive) version of the company’s Connect (now discontinued) ; it has a better built-in DAC supports AirPlay 2 and thanks to its bespoke all-black design looks more like a typical audio component.

Like the Connect the Port is a wireless streamer with a built-in DAC. It has RCA and digital coaxial audio outputs for connecting a stereo or an AV receiver and thus allows you to control and play music on that system via the Sonos app just as if it were a Sonos speaker. The Port also has an RCA audio in port for connecting audio sources like a turntable (with a built-in preamp) or CD player; this then allows you to play music from those sources on your existing Sonos speakers.

Maybe the most interesting upgrade is the Port’s 12-volt trigger which gives it (and you) a little more control of the connected receiver or amp. It essentially eliminates the need for you to manually turn on the receiver or stereo or switch to the proper inputs because everything just turns on when you start streaming via the Sonos app to stream music. There’s a catch however and it’s only newer stereos and receivers that have a 12-volt trigger input. (My three-year-old Yamaha receiver didn’t support it so I still have to use the receiver’s remote to switch inputs unfortunately.)

It’s true that most newer audio components have built-in Bluetooth so simply adding “streaming” to your stereo receiver on its own isn’t actually a big feature of the Port. However the Port does have a fancy new digital-to-analog converter (DAC) compared to the Connect and supports Wi-Fi streaming like Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2; so it’s going to stream higher-resolution and all-around better sounding audio than Bluetooth.",,,

Our footprint in Downtown Los Angeles is distributed between three separate facilities offering true dispersed Edge capability.”

Known as the Aon Center and owned by Shorenstein Properties the 62-story office skyscraper at 707 Wilshire Boulevard was built in the early 1970s. The entire building totals around 1.1 million sq ft (102200 sqm).

The Australian Edge data center firm provides modular ‘off grid’ data centers powered by on-site wind and/or solar power and connected to the main grid as backup. Each facility is equipped with just under 1MW of solar infrastructure and 48-hour battery and UPS backup equipment which supports 64 1kW quarter racks. The company says the sites can produce more electricity than they use.

In April of this year Edge Centers announced plans to procure 20 small data center pods from UK firm DataQube for its US rollout. It has installed a Point of Presence (PoP) in CoreSite’s One Wilshire carrier hotel data center in Los Angeles located close to the 707 Wilshire site. The company has previously said it has plans for another US facility in Dallas Texas.

Through a contract signed on the last day of the International Transportation Fair both companies intend to shorten the time in the delivery of non-commercial merchandise sent to the island from the United States in particular by Cubans residing there according to a report by Prensa Latina (PL) news agency.

The president of Maravana Cargo Alejandro Martínez explained that this is a company that only has two years of creation and that it focuses its possibilities on guaranteeing customers in the United States the arrival of their shipments with the greatest security.

The general director of Aerovaradero Mayelin Gotera told PL that this type of contract allows them to expand their client portfolio based on the approval of the door-to-door delivery of packages for family cargo particularly those from the United States with significant growth in recent years.

To materialize this commercial agreement they will work with more than 23 micro small and medium-sized companies (MSMEs) from all over the country as well as with self-employed workers and state-owned enterprises the source specified.

According to Gotera’s statements they also approved maritime transportation but she clarified that Aerovaradero’s strength will continue to be air transportation so that this alternative will be regulated for very bulky loads and with specifications.

Gotera noted that they are currently creating strategic alliances to expand facilities in addition to reducing rates in correspondence with the reduction of customs duties approved by the country with the aim of benefiting customers in the face of limitations and low availability of goods in the domestic market.

The International Transportation and Logistics Fair which concluded this Friday was attended by other freight forwarders suppliers and logistics companies based in Florida or with representation in Havana such as ASC International Crowley Maritime Corporation and APA Sky Air PL pointed out.

Maravana Cargo’s headquarters are in Hialeah (Florida) and according to its website the company operates in Panama Venezuela Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

That was clear on Tuesday when the county’s just-released annual crop report showed last year’s apple crop dropped in cash value almost 24% to $2.69 million as a result of the drought and bad weather during the bloom season.

That figure represents a small slice of the overall $811 million in value for agricultural crops and livestock in 2021 within Sonoma County. It’s a vital industry in which wine grapes represented two thirds of the overall value and milk another 15%.

Local growers have adapted in recent years by selling at farmers markets and local shops as well as to producers of hard cider where they can get better prices.

But there also is another valuable resource for them at the Manzana Products Co. plant in rural Sebastopol which uses organic apples to make juice cider vinegar and applesauce at the facility founded 100 years ago.

How important is the facility to local growers?

Eric Marshall whose family has farmed apples locally since the 1940s put it bluntly: “If Manzana wasn’t there I wouldn’t be doing it.”

Manzana was bought a decade ago by Agrial a French-based food company with global operations and it is committed to a long-term investment with the plant which employs 130 full-time workers said Andy Kay. He’s a British native who serves as CEO . It adds up to another 50 employees during the peak harvest time.

“I think we've invested a lot to grow the capacity since Agrial came here 10 years ago” Kay said. “Now is the time to do the renewal and make this a viable operation for the next 100 years. That's the kind of the process we're going through right now.”

That support is critical because Manzana is a key food processor that keeps local agriculture viable said Dayna Ghirardelli executive director of the Sonoma County Farm Bureau.

“They play a huge role. With every processor that goes out of business or leaves the area it creates a major strain on production and the end product” Ghirardelli said.

While local grape growers have an array of nearby wineries to crush their fruit others are not so lucky. Dairy farmers still have a few key local plants that process milk. That list includes Clover Sonoma and Straus Family Creamery in Petaluma to make it more affordable especially in transportation costs as dairy farmers have struggled amid the drought and inflation for their supplies.

Some local ranchers were blindsided when Marin Sun Farms in 2020 stopped accepting animals at its slaughterhouse for ranchers that had their own private labels. They were forced to band together and form their own cooperative to purchase a $1.2 million mobile processing plant that they put into use earlier this year.

“Every time a processor leaves the area it just makes it that much harder” Ghirardelli said.

Manzana has adjusted with changes as a result of the pandemic where it saw increased demand while also trying to keep its employees safe Kay said. Some of the workers have had decades at the plant which is one of the largest private employers in west county.

“They are extremely dedicated” he said.

The organic apple product category experienced around 5% annual growth before COVID but that jumped to 20% at the onset of the pandemic as consumers were looking for more healthy products Kay said.

For example the apple cider vinegar market went up about 40% very quickly he added. Customers use apple cider vinegar in various ways such as diluted in water or as part of a salad dressing. Others use it for cleaning and even washing their hair.

“Apple cider vinegar in the prior three years was declining” said Alissa Trinei marketing specialist for Manzana. “Once COVID hit it just immediately skyrocketed.”

The increased demand came as sourcing for apples has become more difficult.

The plant processes approximately 50000 tons of organic apples annually with about 80% trucked in from Washington State and most of the rest coming from Sonoma County growers. The Washington State yield is down 11% for the current harvest year that followed a 20% decrease from the previous year Kay said.

“We are basically in a pretty tough situation. It’s mainly climate related” he said of the Washington State crop.

Washington State is the dominant force in the market because it produces more than half of the nation’s apple crop and California is much farther behind in fifth place according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMC8xMC9pZi15b3Utc3BlbnQtMzk5LTk5LW9uLWFwcGxlLXN0b2NrLWluc3RlYWQtb2YtYW4taXBvZC1pbi0yMDAxLXlvdWQtbm93LWhhdmUtOTIxNzkyMi5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9ib2luZ2JvaW5nLm5ldC8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL2lmLXlvdS1zcGVudC0zOTktOTktb24tYXBwbGUtc3RvY2staW5zdGVhZC1vZi1hbi1pcG9kLWluLTIwMDEteW91ZC1ub3ctaGF2ZS05MjE3OTIyLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If you spent $399.99 on Apple stock instead of an iPod in 2001 you'd now have (Update: $160K),"When the iPod debuted at $399.99 on October 23 2001 Apple Inc stock sat at $0.34 a share so this theoretical exercise begins with a nice round'ish 1175 shares with the change getting charged to the game about $160000 in 2022 dollars for an adjusted for inflation investment of $669.30.

Steve Jobs' 2001 iPod introduction provides excellent context on the portable music players from that era in the video below. It's going to sound crazy but even knowing that I could've made millions of dollars instead of buying my first iPod in 2003 I still feel my life would have been different in unpleasant ways because the liberating feeling of finally having access to any music I wished was a phase change in my technological progression. Watching a hale Steve Jobs talking about biting his fingernails is something that I don't remember when watching this back in 2001 just 42 days after 9/11; and it feels so incredibly period correct to hear Jobs sing along with The Beatles like a video Easter Egg of unfiltered nostalgia lying in wait for those willing to click.

The US semiconductor giants that make the most advanced chips – and by extension semiconductor equipment makers – have been hounded by a multitude of problems this year one layered on top of the other and their stocks have gotten crushed with Nvidia down 66% from the peak AMD down 64% Intel down 63% from its high in April 2021 and 66% from its all-time high in August 2000 (the glories of 22 years of buy-and-hold) Marvell Technologies down 57% Micron down 48% Applied Materials down 53%. They’ve issued earnings warnings starting in the spring – with the most recent batch out last week when AMD which makes processors for PCs and Samsung the world’s largest memory chipmaker reported results that pointed at an even deeper-than-feared slowdown for advanced chips.

On top of all this on Friday the White House with bi-partisan support announced new restrictions on these companies in their dealings with China. Friday was harsh for those stocks and today so far is still harsh. For example Nvidia the largest US chipmaker by market cap lost 12% over those two days through early afternoon today.

The mind-boggling bubble in these stocks during 2020 and 2021 is now getting unwound. Nvidia shares [NVDA] are back where they’d first been in August 2020. Between February 2020 and the peak in November 2021 they exploded by 360%. And that – I’ll repeat it because that’s what it is – mind-boggling gain is now getting unwound. The shares have plunged so hard since November that the 12% drop over the past two days is barely visible (data by YCharts):

The new restrictions on these companies in their dealings with China that the White House announced on Friday came on top of a slew of other issues that had been boiling over all year.

There was the collapse in demand for cutting-edge processors used in crypto mining rigs. Demand collapsed after crypto prices started plunging in November 2021 which took all the fun out of crypto mining and crypto miners switched to survival mode and slashed their purchases of crypto mining rigs. Nvidia has warned about this starting earlier this year.

Then there was the down-turn in the PC and laptop business after the blistering boom during the pandemic when folks switched to working from home and learning at home and they their companies and their schools had to buy all sorts of electronic equipment. When this buying boom ended chipmakers that make advanced processors and memory chips for laptops and PCs took a hit. This downturn continued in Q3 when shipments of PCs and laptops fell by 15% from the boom a year ago according to the International Data Corporation today. But note: there were still more PCs and laptops shipped in Q3 than before the pandemic! It’s just that the boom vanished.

Global smartphone shipment started declining on a year-over-year basis in Q4 2021 and have continued to decline year-over-year in Q1 and Q2 2022 and there are bad omens coming out of the industry from all over the place.

There has been a litany of earnings warnings from chipmakers this year for these and a slew of other reasons.

All this comes even as cheap low-end tailing-edge semiconductors and microcontrollers used in automotive components continue to be dogged by shortages and continue to hamper global auto production. In other words there is a glut in high-end chips and a shortage in the cheap stuff coming out of aging chip plants that companies weren’t motivated to invest in because there isn’t a lot of money in it.

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index [SOX] is down 3.9% at the moment after falling 6.1% on Friday; and it’s down 44% from its high on January 5.

The restrictions imposed on Friday by the White House on US semiconductor makers and semiconductor equipment makers in their dealings with China followed a series of restrictions imposed on them before but they are by far the most comprehensive yet. They require these US companies to obtain licenses to export cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing equipment and cutting-edge semiconductors that are typically used in artificial intelligence supercomputing and modern weapons systems.

“We believe certain advanced computing capabilities which rely on U.S. chips software tooling and technology are fueling the [Chinese] military modernization including the development of weapons of mass destruction” which “poses profound national-security risks” a senior administration official told the Wall Street Journal.

These new restrictions run in parallel with the $50 billion in subsidies that Congress recently passed and that chipmakers will get for setting up chip manufacturing facilities in the US the purpose being to decouple the entire high-tech supply chain from China bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US and halt the process of the US becoming dependent on China for semiconductors.

Intel [INTC] the second-largest US chipmaker by market cap after Nvidia never got back to its all-time high of $75 a share 22 years ago in August 2000 and it’s now down 66% from there. From its recent high in April 2021 it’s down 63% (data by YCharts):

Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] is down 64% from its high in November 2021:

Applied Material [AMAT] is down 53% from its high in January this year:

Shares in Chinese tech leaders Alibaba and Tencent fell on Monday along with those of Chinese chip companies as investors evaluated the likely impact of sweeping US sanctions announced on Friday.

Alibaba shares were down about 2.7 percent in Hong Kong trading as of 9 a.m. BST while Tencent was down about 2.5 percent on fears around the impact the restrictions could have on the data centres the two companies rely on.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) a major contract chipmaker fell 3.5 percent while shares in Chinese chip manufacturing equipment maker Naura fell by the daily limit of 10 percent and Hua Hong Semiconductor was down by about 9.5 percent.

New rules

The new restrictions make use of export controls first deployed against telecommunications equipment maker Huawei but are applied more broadly to target the ability of mainland China to produce cutting-edge semiconductors.

The restrictions also target China’s rapidly developing artificial intelligence industry and its ability to use cutting-edge technology such as supercomputers to develop military applications such as nuclear weapons or hypersonic missiles.

In 2020 the US broadened a provision known as the Foreign-Direct Product Rule effectively allowing it to place export restrictions on products made anywhere in the world that contain US technology.

The new rule was initially used to cut off technology to Huawei and then to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

Supercomputers

On Friday the broadened rule was applied to China’s IFLYTEK Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology which were added to the “entity list” trade blacklist in 2019.

The new measures also block shipment of an array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems defined as having more than 100 petaflops of computing power within a floor space of 6400 square feet.

Some industry watchers said this could also affect the commercial data centres used by Chinese tech companies.

The measures formalise letters sent to Nvidia and AMD earlier this year barring shipments of chips used in supercomputers and for artificial intelligence systems.

Memory chips

US companies are to be barred from exporting advanced chip manufacturing tools to China affecting companies such as SMIC Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory.

YMTC and 30 other companies were also placed on a list of “unverified” companies beginning a 60-day countdown that could lead to these firms being added to the entity list effectively blocking US firms from supplying them with even the most basic technology.

The new rules also prohibit “US persons” including individuals and companies from providing direct or indirect suport to Chinese companies involved in advanced chip manufacturing.

The US Commerce Department said it was including exceptions for Chinese factories owned by companies from the US or allied countries such as South Korea or Taiwan that are producing chips for export a move designed to reduce disruption to the already struggling semiconductor supply chain.

Manufacturing equipment

Earlier this year authorities sent letters to US semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers such as Applied Materials and Lam Research barring them from supplying advanced tools to Chinese factories.

The broadest of the new restrictions affect exports from US companies such as AMD Nvidia Applied Materials and Lam Research and the US acknowledged it has not yet secured agreements with allied countries to place similar restrictions on their firms.

This means China could potentially obtain the technology it needs elsewhere circumventing the restrictions while dealing a commercial blow to US companies.

“We recognise that the unilateral controls we’re putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don’t join us” a senior US government official told reporters. “And we risk harming US technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.”

‘Level the playing field’

The Semiconductor Industry Association said it was studying the new regulations and urged the US to “implement the rules in a targeted way – and in collaboration with international partners – to help level the playing field”.

China’s foreign ministry on Saturday called the new rules an abuse of trade measures designed to reinforce the US’ “technological hegemony”."

Micromobbin’

The big news of this week was sadly more layoffs in the micromobility world.

Tier laid off about 10% of its Spin staff including a number of executives. The company is also exiting Canada and Seattle. Spin told its workforce that U.S. demand had been underwhelming and rising inflation and a tightening VC funding environment led to the need to tighten the purse strings.

While the layoffs affected corporate teams — including engineering partnerships and policy community partnerships and HR according to a source familiar with the matter — the operations teams were largely unaffected. One industry insider told TechCrunch that might be because Tier can handle many of those tasks but would still need help on the ground when it decides to send over its new e-scooters.

The micromobility sector has struggled in 2022. A number of companies including Bird Superpedestrian and Voi have cut staff. Many of those layoffs occurred over the summer but now it seems another wave of layoffs is washing over the industry.

Spin wasn’t the only micromobility company that has made cuts this month. Zoomo also suffered some layoffs this week. The Aussie company downsized its global workforce by 16%.

In other news …

Barcelona is doing a one-year pilot project using the energy recovered from metro trains braking to charge personal e-scooters. *Chef’s kiss!* Two of my favorite things — public transit and micromobility.

A New York City Council member is pushing a bill that will allow New Yorkers to benefit from ratting out owners of vehicles blocking bike lanes or entrances/exits of school buildings sidewalks and crosswalks.

Deal of the week

Five years ago Intel bought Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Now Mobileye is on the path to becoming a publicly traded company.

The company touts a broad vision: An autonomous future “where congestion is seen only in history books.” But its S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission underscores its precarious position in the ever-evolving self-driving vehicle industry Jaclyn Trop reports in a recent TC+ article.

Tl;dr: the company which has carved out massive market share by supplying automakers with computer vision technology to power their advanced driver assistance systems is facing pressure from supply chain constraints and a trend among OEMs to become more vertically integrated.

The S-1 did contain some brights spots though including long-term partnerships with China’s Geely Great Wall Motors and SAIC and Indian automakers such as Mahindra & Mahindra position it for growth in an emerging market.

Other deals that got my attention …

Canada Drives closed a $7.3 million round to expand its online car shopping/delivery platform into new markets. The raise comes a few months after raising $30 million.

Halo Car a Las Vegas-based startup that combines teleoperations and car sharing raised $5 million in a seed round led by climate tech fund At One Ventures with participation from T-Mobile Ventures Earthshot Ventures and existing investor Boost VC.

Phantom Auto acquired video communications company Voysys AB to bolster its teleoperations platform used to remotely operate forklifts yard trucks and delivery robots. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Electric vehicles charging & batteries

Rivian has issued a voluntary recall of all 13000 vehicles it has delivered so far due to a loose fastener. The fastener which may not have been sufficiently torqued on a small percentage of vehicles connects the front upper control arm and steering knuckle. This can cause loose and vibrating tires wheel tilt and loss of steering control.

Sixt said it plans to buy more than 100000 electric vehicles from Chinese automaker BYD for its European rental fleet between now and 2028.

Tesla dominated the news cycle once again:

The automaker delivered 343830 vehicles in the third quarter a record number that still failed to meet analysts’ expectations. There was also a larger-than-usual gap between production and delivery numbers.

Daily Post Staff Writer

City Utilities Commissioner Lisa Forssell wants Palo Alto City Council to stop negotiating with developers.

Instead the city should come up with plans for areas like El Camino Real and downtown so that it’s clear up front what is and isn’t allowed.

These plans should favor housing public transit and thriving businesses and they shouldn’t take so long to see through she said.

“We need a process that is lighter on our feet than what we have now” Forssell said in an interview.

Forssell said that taller and denser buildings are necessary to combat the housing crisis and she is willing to exceed the city’s 50-foot height limit.

“I’d rather build up than across and eat up green space and parkland” she said.

Forssell has been on the city’s Utilities Advisory Commission for the last six years so she is well-versed in issues facing the city. The grid can’t handle much more capacity yet the city has a goal to convert all homes from natural gas to electric appliances.

Forssell said that any residents tell her that they want their power lines put underground. Council is also looking at building a high-speed fiber internet network.

In a perfect world the city would upgrade transformers underground power lines and build a fiber internet network at the same time Forssell said. But the crisis situations must be addressed first and Forssell said that’s the lack of transformer capacity.

Forssell said she isn’t sold on creating a fiber network to compete with AT&T and Comcast. The areas that are most underserved by those companies are the most expensive to build to making a business case difficult. And the Utilities Department and the city are already overworked and facing big problems.

“If we were firing on all cylinders and Utilities had a full crew of linesman and system operators and engineers and program managers then I’d be singing a different tune” she said. “And I hope we can get back to doing nice things like fiber but it’s just not for me our top priority.”

Throughout Forssell’s tenure as a commissioner she said she has heard about staffing shortages because of the cost of living. The city can’t raise rates on customers enough to pay for workers to live in the area so crews commute from the Central Valley she said.

“All arrows lead back to the cost of living in the area which goes back to the cost of housing” she said.

Forssell said she supported Senate Bill 9 a state law that required city’s to approve four homes on a single-family lot as long as the property owner agrees to live in one of the homes for at least three years. The bill allows development to be spread evenly throughout the city.

“In some ways it’s the ultimate local control” she said.

Forssell is in favor of the business tax on the November ballot and she said she would be willing to go higher.

She said she wouldn’t be “super hands-on” with the police department instead deferring to Chief Andrew Binder’s operational expertise. She wasn’t ready to take a position on whether police dogs should be used to bite people. She said her gut feeling is to be opposed but she wants to hear from the other side.

Like fellow candidate Julie Lythcott-Haims Forssell said she supports the city’s plan to get rid of natural gas in homes and she would not support a ballot initiative to decide whether to do so.

The transition will take around a decade and there may be limited exceptions she said.

Forssell is the wealthiest of all of the candidates with over $2 million in stock at Apple and Arista Networks where her husband works. She said she was fortunate to start at Apple in 2017 putting her in the right place at the right time.

Forrsell also has a greater-than-$1 million stake in Woven Earth Ventures a “fund of funds” that invests in energy and climate startups. She said she isn’t involved in any day-to-day decisions.

Forssell is one of seven candidates running for three seats on council. The Post is interviewing all of the candidates and publishing summaries of their answers before ballots are mailed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9uZWlsLWRlZ3Jhc3NlLXR5c29uLWZhY3QtY2hlY2tzLTE0MzA1MTczNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neil deGrasse Tyson Fact-Checks 'Top Gun: Maverick': Tom Cruise Should Be 'Very Dead',"Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is calling Tom Cruise’s stunts in “Top Gun: Maverick” an impossible mission.

The global blockbuster sequel to “Top Gun” begins with Cruise reprising his role as Navy pilot Maverick hitting Mach 10.5 and having to eject from the cockpit. Tyson took to Twitter to point out that Maverick would “splatter” immediately after leaving the plane.

More from IndieWire

“Late to the party here but in this year’s ‘Top Gun’ Tom Cruise’s character Maverick ejects from a hypersonic plane at Mach 10.5 before it crashed. He survived with no injuries. At that air speed his body would splatter like a chainmail glove swatting a worm” Tyson tweeted. “At supersonic speeds air cannot smoothly part for you. You must pierce it which largely accounts for the difference in fuselage designs between subsonic and supersonic planes. For this reason the air on your body if ejecting at these speeds might as well be a brick wall.”

Tyson continued “When Maverick ejected at Mach 10.5 he was going 7000 mph giving him 400 million joules of kinetic energy — the explosive power of 100 kg of TNT. A situation that human physiology is not designed to survive.” He added: “So no. Maverick does not walk away from this. He be dead. Very dead.”

Later as part of the mission for the Top Gun pilots Tyson wrote that “they dangerously fly under the radar through a narrow winding canyon to destroy a target avoiding multiple banks of surface-to-air missiles. But why not first take out the missile banks? Could then fly without daredevil maneuvers. Just sayin’.”

“Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda filmed over 813 hours of aerial footage with the actors led by Cruise really performing their death-defying stunts.

“It’s like making a play” Kosinski told IndieWire. “You create the performance in rehearsal and then it’s performed. We had a big monitor and went over every shot of the day every storyboard every piece of previs every line of dialogue. We’d talk about the altitude of the jet the terrain the maneuver the line the eyeline where the sun needs to be. It was laborious but necessary with safety being the most important consideration.”

Meanwhile “Mission: Impossible” star Cruise has his sights set on more out-of-this-world stunts: becoming the first actor to shoot a film in space. Cruise has teamed up with “The Bourne Identity” director Doug Liman for a feature set at the International Space Station.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Le Niger a célébré le dimanche 9 octobre 2022 la journée mondiale de la poste en commémoration du 148ème anniversaire de l’Union Postale Universelle (UPU) institution spécialisée de l’Organisation des Nations Unies (ONU). Cette journée faut-il le rappeler est un événement qui a été institué lors du congrès postal universel de Tokyo en 1969 pour marquer la date d’anniversaire de la création de l’Union Postale Universelle (UPU). Cette année le thème retenu pour la célébration de la journée est «la poste pour la planète».

Dans un message livré à cette occasion le ministre de la Poste et des Nouvelles Technologies de l’Information M. Hassane Barazé Moussa a déclaré que le réseau postal en tant que système organisé est par essence un outil de mise en relation de l’ensemble des composantes de la société notamment les hommes les entreprises les organisations les Etats et l’environnement. Il a précisé que le secteur postal emploie plus de cinq millions de personnes dans plus de 600.000 bureaux répartis dans 192 pays et distribue des centaines de milliards des centaines de milliards d’envois postaux par an.

Le ministre de la Poste et des Nouvelles Technologie de l’Information a en outre souligné qu’en tant qu’acteur international en matière de distribution de marchandises et de services essentiels la poste est la mieux placée pour montrer la voie à ses partenaires sur l’ensemble de la chaine logique mondiale. Aussi a-t-il ajouté elle peut être une pionnière pour améliorer les activités d’atténuation d’adaptation et de résilience en matière de changement climatique au sein des autres secteurs. L’énergie est selon lui essentielle au bon fonctionnement du réseau postal mondial. Les véhicules les bâtiments et l’infrastructure numérique nécessaire à la prestation des services postaux dépendent tous d’un approvisionnement en énergie. Malheureusement a-t-il déploré cette énergie utilisée rejette dans l’atmosphère des gaz à effet de serre responsable du réchauffement climatique.

M. Hassane Barazé Moussa a en outre indiqué que l’énergie est donc au cœur des engagements et des obligations du secteur postal en matière de protection du climat. C’est pourquoi a-t-il dit collectivement les pays membres de l’UPU se sont engagés à prendre plusieurs mesures visant à réduire les émissions mondiales des gaz à effet de serre provenant des opérations postales et accroitre leur résilience face aux perturbations dues au changement climatique. Cela reflète les engagements nationaux plus larges en matière d’atténuation et d’adaptation pris par les signataires de l’accord de Paris. L’action sur le changement climatique a notifié le ministre permettra aussi de faire progresser les objectifs de développement durable. «Nous devons songer à notre impact au delà de nos bureaux de nos réseaux et de nos frontières. Ce combat concerne chaque personne chaque entreprise et chaque nation sur cette planète. Nous devons travailler ensemble pour garantir un avenir meilleur aux générations à venir» a estimé le ministre de la Poste.

D’après M. Hassane Barazé Moussa au Niger les questions liées au changement climatique ont été prises en compte dans tous les documents d’orientations publiques. C’est ainsi que dans la SDDCI Niger 2030 l’Etat ambitionne d’atténuer les effets négatifs du changement climatique sur les conditions de vie des populations en mettant l’accent sur la mise en œuvre de l’initiative africaine «Grande Muraille Verte» et de la contribution déterminée au niveau national révisée. Dans cette démarche nationale a-t-il poursuivi le secteur postal et la chaine des services postaux sont appelés à devenir des éléments clés de l’émergence tels que déclinés dans la déclaration de Politique Général du Gouvernement. Le ministre de la poste et des Nouvelles Technologies de l’Information a enfin précisé que l’objectif du gouvernement est de faire du secteur postal un secteur performant et dynamique qui facilite les échanges et l’inclusion financière tout en assurant une transition écologique durable.

Avant l'ouverture de l'audience les avocats des parties civiles avaient marqué leur volonté de restituer à ce drame sa ""dimension humaine"". Tels sont les espoirs des familles des 228 victimes du crash du vol AF447 au terme de longues batailles d'expertises depuis l'accident survenu le 1er juin 2009. ""Air France n'a rien fait Airbus a été totalement indifférent. Voilà l'enjeu de ce procès c'est d'abord pour nous de reconstituer cette dimension humaine"" a souligné l'un des avocats des parties civiles Me Alain Jakubowicz. ""C'est un procès où les victimes doivent rester au centre du débat. On ne veut pas qu'Airbus ou Air France fassent de ce procès une conférence d'ingénieurs"" a renchéri Me Sébastien Busy. La directrice générale d'Air France Anne Rigail s'est efforcée de répondre d'emblée aux attentes des parties civiles qui ont bruyamment manifesté leur colère pour certaines en lisant à la barre une déclaration assurant que ""la mémoire des victimes"" n'avait ""jamais quitté"" la compagnie. ""Air France n'oubliera jamais"" a-t-elle dit alors que les noms des 228 victimes avaient été lus en préambule de l'audience.

Besoin de comprendre

Dans la salle une centaine de parties civiles de plusieurs nationalités. Trente-trois nationalités au total étaient représentées à bord de l'AF447 principalement des Français des Brésiliens et des Allemands. Anne Rigail a dit partager ""la douleur"" née de ce ""drame sans équivalent"" ""indélébile"" mais aussi ""le besoin de comprendre"" assurant que la compagnie avait toujours fait acte de ""transparence"". Pour Airbus le directeur général Guillaume Faury a également présenté ses condoléances. ""Trop peu trop tard!"" a-t-on entendu dans les rangs des parties civiles. ""Ce sera un procès difficile. Nous sommes ici pour offrir notre compassion (...) mais aussi notre contribution à la vérité"" a dit Guillaume Faury à des journalistes. Les deux représentants ont suscité l'indignation des parties civiles en maintenant à la barre que leurs entreprises respectives n'avaient pas commis de faute pénale. ""J'ai conscience que la parole d'Air France pourra être difficile à entendre"" a dit la directrice générale. ""C'est une honte!"" ont protesté des proches de victimes.

La justice française avait prononcé un non-lieu dans cette affaire en 2019 mais cette décision avait été invalidée deux ans plus tard en appel ouvrant la voie à la tenue d'un procès en correctionnelle pour ""homicides involontaires"" malgré des recours en cassation d'Air France et d'Airbus  jugés irrecevables en août dernier. C'est la première fois que la responsabilité collective d'une entreprise française est mise en cause dans un procès pour ""homicides involontaires"" après un crash aérien.

En 2009 le vol AF447 reliant Rio de Janeiro à Paris s'était écrasé en pleine nuit entraînant la mort de ses 216 passagers et 12 membres d'équipage. Il s'agit de la catastrophe la plus meurtrière de l'histoire d'Air France

Tirer les enseignements

Les enquêteurs qui ont examiné les boîtes noires retrouvées après deux ans de recherche par 4.000 mètres de fond ont conclu que les pilotes n'avaient pas réagi comme il aurait fallu à une perte de données de vol provoquée par le givrage des sondes anémométriques de l'Airbus A330 en pleine tempête équatoriale au-dessus du Pot-au-Noir. Désorientés ils n'avaient pu empêcher un décrochage aérodynamique ou chute libre de l'appareil de 205 tonnes le précipitant vers les eaux de l'Atlantique malgré les signaux d'alerte. Aucun des 226 passagers et 12 membres d'équipage n'a survécu. Les batailles d'expertises ont porté sur la responsabilité d'Air France et d'Airbus dans ce drame écartée dans un premier temps par la justice avant que la Cour d'appel n'estime que la compagnie aérienne et le constructeur n'avaient pas pris les mesures nécessaires d'information et de formation des pilotes pour les préparer à réagir à ce problème connu. Le BEA (Bureau d'enquêtes et d'analyses pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile) a en effet révélé qu'Air France s'était inquiétée des défaillances des sondes Pitot fabriquées par Thalès pour mesurer la vitesse en vol et avait commencé à en recevoir un nouveau modèle moins sujet aux problèmes de givrage à haute altitude lorsque le drame s'est produit. Cette question sera au coeur des deux mois d'audiences au tribunal correctionnel de Paris qui s'achèveront le 8 décembre. Air France et Airbus ne risquent que des amendes - d'un montant maximal de 225.000 euros - si la justice retient une faute pénale de leur part. ""Ce n'est pas les 225.000 euros qui vont leur faire peur. C'est leur réputation. (...) Pour nous c'est tout autre chose c'est d'abord une vérité (...) et puis faire en sorte que de toutes ces grandes catastrophes l'on tire les enseignements"" a dit Me Alain Jakubowicz.

Jim (as he preferred to be called) was an award-winning mathematician a legend in quantitative investing and an inspired and generous philanthropist.

Together with his wife Simons Foundation chair Marilyn Simons he gave billions of dollars to hundreds of philanthropic causes particularly those supporting math and science research and education. In 1994 they established the Simons Foundation which supports scientists and organizations worldwide in advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences.

Jim was active in the work of the Simons Foundation until the end of his life and his curiosity and lifelong passion for math and basic science were an inspiration to those around him. He was determined to make a meaningful difference in the level of support that mathematics and basic sciences received in the United States notably by sponsoring projects that were important but unlikely to find funding elsewhere.

Over its 30-year history the Simons Foundation’s work has led to breakthroughs in our understanding of autism the origins of the universe cellular biology and computational science. Jim and Marilyn’s giving continues to support the next generation of mathematicians and scientists at schools and universities in New York City and around the world.

Jim frequently said that he went through three phases in his professional life: mathematician investor and philanthropist. He previously chaired the math department at Stony Brook University in New York and his mathematical breakthroughs during that time are now instrumental to fields such as string theory topology and condensed matter physics.

In 1978 Jim founded what would become Renaissance Technologies a hedge fund that pioneered quantitative trading and became one of the most profitable investment firms in history. He then turned his focus to making a difference in the world through the Simons Foundation Simons Foundation International Math for America and other philanthropic efforts.

“Jim was an exceptional leader who did transformative work in mathematics and developed a world-leading investment company” says Simons Foundation president David Spergel. “Together with Marilyn Simons the current Simons Foundation board chair Jim created an organization that has already had enormous impact in mathematics basic science and our understanding of autism. The Simons Foundation an in-perpetuity foundation will carry their vision for philanthropy into the future.”

Jim Simons is survived by his wife three children five grandchildren a great-grandchild and countless colleagues friends and family who fondly recall his genuine curiosity and quick wit.

We know that many people have stories messages and memories they would like to share about Jim. Please send them to [email protected].

Information on memorial services and other events honoring Jim’s life and legacy will be posted on the Simons Foundation website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2ppbS1zaW1vbnMtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcXVhbnRpdGF0aXZlLWludmVzdGluZy1waW9uZWVyLXdoby1nZW5lcmF0ZWQtZXllLXBvcHBpbmctcmV0dXJucy1kaWVzLWF0LTg2Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvamltLXNpbW9ucy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1xdWFudGl0YXRpdmUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLXBpb25lZXItd2hvLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1leWUtcG9wcGluZy1yZXR1cm5zLWRpZXMtYXQtODYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Simons billionaire quantitative investing pioneer who generated eye-popping returns dies at 86,"Jim Simons a mathematician who founded the most successful quantitative hedge fund of all time passed away on Friday in New York City his foundation announced on its website.

Pioneering mathematical models and algorithms to make investment decisions Simons left behind a track record at Renaissance Technologies that bested legends such as Warren Buffett and George Soros. His flagship Medallion Fund enjoyed annual returns of 66% during a period from 1988 to 2018 according to Gregory Zuckerman's book ""The Man Who Solved the Market.""

During the Vietnam War he worked as codebreaker for U.S. intelligence monitoring the Soviet Union and successfully cracking a Russian code.

Simons received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT in 1958 and earned his PhD in mathematics from the University of California Berkeley at the age of 23. The quant guru founded what became Renaissance in 1978 at the age of 40 after he quit academia and decided to give a shot at trading.

Unlike most investors who studied fundamentals such as sales and earnings and profit margins to evaluate a company's worth Simons relied entirely on an automated trading system to take advantage of market inefficiencies and trading patterns.

More women becoming single parents by choice

New York City — Up against her biological clock Traci Kodeck faced a tough decision at age 39.

She says she remembered the moment she decided to have a baby on her own.

""I was with my best friend and I said 'I don't have a partner I need to be a mom'"" Kodeck told CBS News.

She emptied her savings to cover fertility treatments ultimately using sperm donated by a friend. After three years of trying she had Zola.

""Then it was 'Oh my gosh I'm taking home a human.' And she was perfect"" Kodeck said.

Kodeck belongs to the organization Single Mothers by Choice. Its 30000 members are part of a growing trend of women having babies alone because they're tired of waiting for ""the one"" or they simply want to parent solo like Emma Ramos mother to 2-year-old Michael.

She describes her life as a single mother by choice as ""beautiful chaos.""

As a teenager Ramos dreamed of having a child not a partner. Modern attitudes have helped make that possible. According to a Pew Research Center survey from last year 78% of Americans find single parenting acceptable. Although more 93% support a two-parent household.

""That speaks to the misconception...that we have somehow purposefully handicapped our children by…only bringing them into the world with one parent"" Ramos said.

Ramos admits that the responsibility of shouldering the decision-making for her family does come with challenges.

""Decision-making I would say is a blessing"" Ramos said. ""But then I suppose if I make the wrong decision I'm the only one…to blame I guess.""

Zola Kodeck recently turned 11 just in time for Mother's Day.

""Having a single mom by choice can be hard like when you're first growing up but then my mom just wanted me nobody else"" Zola said. ""…Every day to me is like a Mother's Day.""

""Everything I do I do for her"" Traci said of her daughter. ""This house is for her. My job it's all for her."""

Cloud-based construction management apps have been making waves in the industry leading to a rapid shift to the cloud over the last five years. This move to cloud-based work to help with transparency and efficiency on jobsites has only intensified in the last few years making it evermore important to keep your tech up to speed.



For your company going digital is one thing but being on the cloud is another. Even if you work in a digital environment more now than you did in the past your business could still benefit from better connectivity in the office and out on the field.



How can you stay connected and work more efficiently? Adopt cloud-based software like your competitors. Cloud-based software continues to be the peak of collaborative tech– with it you can work from anywhere access your information on the go and even remotely visit a worksite to make sure things are getting done. No mobile platform without cloud access is going to give you the same results.

So whether your company is using the cloud now or you’re just thinking about looking into cloud-based construction management software for the first time you need to know the differences between the types of software and platforms you’ll see as well as all the benefits the cloud offers. In this article we’ll discuss the evolution of cloud-based software in the construction industry and the trends that are helping to usher in the future of the Cloud in the field.

Evolution of Cloud Based Software in Construction

Cloud-based software has been evolving and getting rooted into the construction industry over the last several years becoming even more important in the last three.

This kind of software began to evolve in the 2000s but most construction companies were still using paper-based plans and workflows at that time. They’d work in the office or out in the field and need to do reports after traveling or by calling over a landline. Cellular service was not even prominent at that time though it was becoming more common.

It wasn’t until 2007 that the introduction of the smartphone started to cause a stir and pushed what could be done remotely. Companies found that they were able to push more toward mobile connectivity replacing the pen-and-paper concepts of the past for digital processes that helped them become more efficient.

At that time the cloud was still not prominent or well-developed. Many files would be available on a single desktop or network but they were still at the very least centralized in those systems. Seeing a need for better connectivity in the field and remotely that soon began to change.

After construction professionals realized that there were benefits of not needing to do everything on paper or to go back to the office to make updates to digital documents they started looking for other options. At the same time (around 2010) tablets hit the scene and changed everything across multiple industries when cloud-based apps were developed.

With the introduction of cloud-based construction apps professionals were empowered to work remotely being able to be freer and more efficient from anywhere they could get an internet connection. Their devices could keep them up to date at all times significantly reducing errors time traveling between the office and field and cutting down on miscommunication.

Since then cloud-based software has only grown in popularity. Still it was not being integrated rapidly until around 2020 when the pandemic resulted in stay-at-home orders and an increased movement to remote working conditions. That push has resulted in a rapid integration of cloud-based tech leading most companies to use it today.

The Benefits of Cloud–Based Construction Management

Cloud-based construction management technology includes all the systems and storage devices strategies and processes needed to manage any construction project. On the cloud this kind of management goes even further by shifting from “we need this data somewhere accessible” to “we need to be able to collaborate effectively and manage our processes on the cloud.”

Cloud-based construction management technology is changing the way the construction industry works much to the benefit of those working on projects. Today projects have the potential to run more efficiently and smoothly than ever before all thanks to the way construction management apps and the cloud work together to create a transparent efficient method for clarifying the project and making data accessible.

What are the benefits of having your cloud-based construction management system on the cloud?

Enhanced Accessibility to Save Time

With cloud-based technology anyone with the right qualifiers can log in and access the data they’re looking for. Having everything centered and accessible within a cloud-based construction management system can streamline how you find information.

In a past FMI report it was found that construction professionals spent around 35% of the time on unproductive activities like dealing with mistakes or conflict resolution. The benefit of cloud-based systems and platforms is that they’re much more accessible and transparent so they reduce the likelihood of problems arising.

When processes are run with cloud–based construction management systems teams save time. They just have to log into the app or program to get into their particular project and double-check their documents plans work orders or other relevant data. Additionally there is a huge benefit in that people no longer have to make trips to deliver photos or plans — everything is right there waiting for anyone who has been granted access to the system.

United Teams with a Single Source of Truth

There is nothing more important than making sure your team has a single source of information during a complicated project. By providing one comprehensive touchpoint you can cut down on errors and misunderstandings helping your project move forward more smoothly.

A single source of truth (SSOT) provides one reliable source of data for everyone on your team. Those who have access to the data have updates in real time. An SSOT helps improve consistency by making sure everyone is on the same page.

The enhanced collaboration provided by cloud-based project management makes it simpler for teams to work together. The software tracks changes and supervisors or team members can identify work progress from various stakeholders and trades to understand what’s happening with the project.

In the event of a change or critical update the entire team can be notified at once helping halt the project or encourage people to adjust their workflow to new specification after resolving the conflict or issue that has arisen.

Scaled Platforms That Match Company Needs

A further benefit of cloud-based construction management software apps or platforms is that this kind of technology can be scaled. Even if your company is small now and has limited needs for technology you will still want to be able to scale as your business grows.

Since platforms make sure that you have project information available anywhere you have an internet connection you just have to log into any mobile device to provide a client or customer with detailed information about your services history projects and more. All of this means that you’re less likely to miss out on opportunities because you always have the information you need at hand.

Assurance and Security for Your Data

Among the best features of cloud computing in the construction industry is the security that it provides to your business.

Having everything backed up on the cloud is essential to protect your business’s interests. On the cloud you can keep your customer data designs financial information proprietary details plans and more safe and secure. If a computer crashes or your phone is damaged you don’t have to worry about losing your files–everything is going to be right where you left it on the cloud.

It’s just reality that accidents and unexpected events happen. From dropping a laptop with project details on it to shredding the wrong pile of paperwork you could run into all kinds of issues that slow down your productivity. Fortunately the cloud has your back. It provides accessible off-site storage that is there for you regardless of what problems you have in the offline world. Whether your business has a flood fire or another kind of emergency you can get all your files back as long as they’re backed up on the cloud.

Choosing the Best Cloud-Based Construction Management Solution

So if you’re ready to start moving your processes onto the cloud you may want to consider finding the right cloud-based construction management tools for your business first.

Not all cloud solutions are created equally which can feel overwhelming since there are so many to choose from. Fortunately there are tips you can use to find the best cloud-based construction management solution for your company so you get the solution that has the right features to help you scale your business while staying connected.

What should you look for?

A strong platform experience

On any platform you need to have an excellent common data environment (CDE). This is a repository that securely stores your data which may range from contracts to models to specifications all in one centralized location.

Watch Now: The Benefits of Adopting a Construction Platform

You also want the platform to help connect your data and teams so your teams are updated regularly and have access to the information they need. Along with that the platform should connect your workflows and project phases so you can minimize data loss during the progression of the project. This should apply to design and construction all the way through turnover.

A robust integration ecosystem

You also want to choose cloud-based management technology with a strong integration ecosystem. Talk to vendors about how they define their ecosystem. Is the integration as open as it needs to be? If not the system may be less functional than you’d hoped.

Having your systems in an interconnected ecosystem allows you to leverage information more easily. You’re not having to flip back and forth between Excel documents or printed sheets. Instead with the availability of APIs and data you can take advantage of having your data all in one place and leverage it to enhance your project execution strategies.

Watch Now: Adopting Cloud-Based Technology for Better Cost Management

A strong integration ecosystem means that your tech works together seamlessly. Apps that seamlessly interface with one another is the bedrock of connected data in your tech stack.

Customizable

Every team and project is different so you need to have cloud-based software that caters to your needs. Your software solution needs to be customized for your team and it also needs to standardize your processes. Everyone on your team can be on the same page and speak the same language when you use standardized templates systems and programs during the work day.

Helpfully your customized software may help you create customized templates that make it easier for everyone on the project to know what to expect. You won’t have to spend time trying to decipher different templates drawn up by subcontractors or different teams. You’ll have everyone using the same templates and working toward the same goals.

Flexible settings pricing and features

The great thing about today’s best cloud solutions is how flexible they are. You want to have flexible user permission settings (and robust settings) to make sure only the right people see sensitive information and data. With that kind of flexibility in place your company can rest easier knowing that your data is secure.

Flexibility is great when it comes to pricing too. You may want to find a vendor with flexible licensing so you’re not limited in how you purchase the technology. Look for a solution that offers the features you want without inflating the cost because of adding in features you’ll never use.

Native mobile solutions

Construction teams are always on the move but whether you’re in the office or the field you need to have access to your data. Mobile access provides it.

Mobile access shouldn’t come with paired down accessibility and features. You want to make sure any cloud solution has advanced functionality to allow your teams to search and collaborate in real time. To do that look for cloud-based software that is natively mobile.

What does that mean? It means that the solution was designed for mobile devices so it will work with them smoothly. Software retrofitted to a mobile device may be faulty and cause hiccups during your work day.

Find the Right Cloud-Based Construction Management Tool for Your Company

Don’t settle for a mobile construction app without cloud-based project management. A mobile app may be great but if it doesn’t keep you connected on the cloud then it isn’t doing the full job.

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.76%) (BRK.B 0.68%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.08% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnF1YWxpdHltYWcuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzk3MTUzLW5vbmRlc3RydWN0aXZlLXRlc3RpbmctbmR0LXRyZW5kc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nondestructive Testing (NDT) Trends,"Manual or human manipulated NDT is still the primary means of performing Nondestructive Testing (NDT) in unique or one-off applications. Mechanical aids and/or computer assisted manipulation and scanning devices can reduce data gathering time on the site of the item being inspected.

Digitalizing data for everything that can be thought of is a continuing trend. The computer can then perform analysis above and beyond the human analysis of analog data.

Automated or semi-automated inspection maximizes efficiency for performing NDT of repetitive or continuous inspections. This is a mechanical improvement trend that has been going on since the beginning of specialized manufacturing processes. The industrial revolution has been based on this fact for a hundred years. Computers make the process even more efficient. Robots have replaced manual skills at an ever increasing rate.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents:"" any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.

Artificial Intelligence powered Automatic Optical Inspection Solutions have the ability to reduce false calls and eliminate defect parts passed in error in the electronic industry.

AI will offer the ability to auto-recognize defects from Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) inspections from multiple NDT methods. This allows the ability to produce an accurate grade for the condition of piping wire parts circuit boards bolts machined products etc. AI has the potential to produce this data more quickly and accurately than the human eye does. Major financial saving can result from reducing human expertise and replacing it with Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to reduce false positives increase confidence in true positives and improve speed of inspection at the same time. However the human elements are not easily replaced for one-off applications not suitable for automation.

Blue tooth communications over relatively short distances reduces need for extra people on a team or extensive use of wiring as data communication method. Bridges buildings ships and other structures can be monitored by continuous monitoring devices. Long term data can be fed to centralized computer systems that feed the sensor data back via blue tooth to a local accumulation station. From there the inspection data can be fed to a central data evaluation center. This could be ultrasonic data from a bridge beam. corrosion monitoring on a pipe or vessel eddy current testing data from thousands of tubes acoustic emission from thousands of wires in a cable of a suspension bridge or other similar applications.









ULTRASONIC TESTING (UT)

Ultrasonic Testing by phased array transducers is the biggest difference to come along in recent times. The big difference between conventional UT and phased array UT is the transducer. Conventional UT’s use single-element transducers or paired element transducers one for transmitting and one for receiving to generate and receive ultrasonic sound waves. When using a single frequency and angle ultrasonic transducer multiple change out of the transducer and angle wedge utilized would be needed to achieve maximum coverage and optimum angle to best reflect off the surface of the discontinuity being sought. Very time consuming at best. With Phased Array UT the single pass over an area of interest can yield multiple angles and frequencies to assure the optimum ability to detect various oriented and surface reflective conditions needed to detect discontinuities.

Automated ultrasonic testing (AUT) uses mechanized scanners that are computer controlled to move transducers over the surface of the material being inspected. As the transducer moves the computerized system acquires ultrasonic inspection data from a predefined programed pattern.









RADIOGRAPHIC TESTING (RT)

Film radiography from the days of Madame Curie has been replaced by Imaging plates and readers. The days of acetate based film being read in front of bright light sources are gone.

Computed radiography (CR) is the most common method of producing digital radiographic images and the first technology that was commercially available.

X-ray equipment used for conventional radiography can be used for CR making the transition from analogue to digital radiography straightforward.

Digital Radiography also known as direct digital radiography uses x-ray–sensitive plates that directly capture data during the patient examination immediately transferring it to a computer system without the use of an intermediate cassette as is the case with CR. This save steps and consumable materials.









LIQUID PENETRANT TESTING (PT)

Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) processing equipment consists of multi-stage immersion systems that integrate aqueous parts cleaning surface preparation and surface treatment in one automated process. Automated FPI systems are ideal for revealing flaws cracks and fatigue signs and for exposing metal grain structure on the surfaces of aerospace turbine engine components.









MAGNETIC PARTCLE TESTING (MT)

Manual MT used to use artificial discontinuities to assure adequate field strength to perform a test. This has transformed into the electronic measurement of guass units by indirect measurement. Complicated formulas can be dropped in lieu of instant reading of magnetic field strength from a gage. This accurately assures adequate field strength for a legitimate test.

Automatic and semi-automatic magnetic particle inspection processing systems in use today provide improved inspection reliability increased inspection productivity and substantially lower inspection costs. Recent advances in automatic inspection systems (AIS) further extend the overall capabilities of the magnetic particle inspection method.









EDDY CURRENT TESTING (ECT)

Automated Inspection Eddy Current is ideally suited to inspection automation particularly of so called rotationally symmetric components as it is a non-contact technique where coupling is not needed and no-effluent is produced.

Complete tube inspection service by advanced tube inspection systems can be bundled four inspection technologies into a single unit. Eddy current Remote Field ET IRIS and MFL.

The ET & RFT is a high-speed multi-channel multi-frequency scanning system with advanced reporting and tube sheet mapping software.

The IRIS system is a single channel ultrasonic scanning system with the ability to inspection tubes in a wide range of diameters.









VISUAL TESTING/REMOTE VISUAL INSPECTION (VT/RVI)

INSPECTION BY RVI

Several industries have utilized RVI/T including borescope (rigid and flexible) and videoscope.

Sanitation system piping has been inspected by rover wheeled devices.

Power plant heat exchanger tubing IDs are inspected by push tube cameras.

Aerospace jet engines are inspected by videoscopes.

Electric power plants  regardless of heat source (nuclear/fossil/thermal) used to make steam are made up of heat pressure and water transfer systems including vessels valves pumps and piping internals. These systems components and parts have been inspected in the energy field by RVI/T for decades also.

Nuclear power plants utilized remote visual testing for the In-Service Inspection (ISI) ASME Section XI programs. This includes reactor vessel internals and removable components which are inspected by remote underwater cameras. Some on a pole and some within remote operating vehicles (ROVs). The top of reactor vessels (PWRs) have been inspected by RVI crawlers looking for leaking control rod penetrations in high radiation areas with hard to access configurations.

Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) pioneered developing Visual Examination for ISI applications with VE-101 102 and 103. In the 1990s VT-1 -2 and -3 were addressed in great depth with a total of 104 hours of training. RVI/T was addressed for the inspection of piping pumps valves reactor vessel internals and removable significant components of reactor vessel internals. Borescopes fiber-scope videoscope cameras underwater cameras and ROV mounted cameras were all applicable to nuclear power plants.

Petro-chemical processing plants have likewise included internal exams of pumps valves and piping internals vis-a-via remote visual testing or inspection.

Any system or component of any size that has the misfortune of loose parts falling into unwanted spaces have called upon the expertise of remote visual inspectors with the special skills of a puppeteer and abilities to operate with indirect images to retrieve the loose parts.

Wind turbines means of power generation are commonly inspected with videoscopes to assess the condition of the transmission gears for wear in hard to reach gear boxes.

Maritime ship propeller s at the four corners of a ship are oriented down into the water and have similar gear boxes as wind turbines. They receive similar RVT videoscope inspections for the same problems of wear and alignment of the transfer gears as do wind turbine oriented upwards in the sky.

OUTDOORS RVI

Bridges electrical high tension lines damns and other altitude challenging objects have in recent years been inspected by remote visual methods carried aloft by drones. This is an application gaining much great acceptance and gaining access to inspect areas previously very expensive to scaffold up or hang down to see.

Videoscope

INDOORS RVI

The goal of using RVI in an indoor inspection (i.e. for a boiler pressure vessel chimney or some other asset that requires entry) is to give inspectors are the primary ways companies save by using indoor drones for inspections

An RVI tool could be something as sophisticated as drone for internal inspections or it could just be a camera hanging from a piece of rope.

Of all the RVI tools available to inspectors indoor drones provide several benefits for NDT.

It is a way to collect data inside an asset without having to put themselves in harm’s way by entering it or having to stand on scaffolding inside of it.

No scaffolding needed. Temporary structures like scaffolding that are used for inspections can be incredibly expensive to put in and take out sometimes costing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single inspection. Using a drone eliminates the need for scaffolding which represents huge potential savings for companies.

Reduced downtimes. Because installing and taking down scaffolding is so time consuming using a drone can also mean significantly shorter turnaround times lessening the loss of potential revenue from having assets offline.

Less liability insurance needed. Because using a drone is safer than sending a person into a confined space some companies have been able to reduce their premiums for liability insurance by using drones for indoor inspections.





CONCLUSION

Labor shortages in the current economic times are greatly magnified when the labor in question is skilled trained labor. The need to emphasize non-college degreed career paths cannot happen fast enough. Notwithstanding the need for most occupations in the skilled craft categories also need some college. More and more the need for an Associate Science degree for the field of nondestructive testing is obvious.

As long as the supply of qualified personnel is inadequate to meet the needs of industry there will be efforts to automate and utilize artificial intelligence to perform and evaluate NDT. Ironically the greater the quality of personnel performing NDT the greater the compensation commensurate with that increased education and skill will be. Therefore the greater the pressure to automate and use artificial intelligence to substitute for the human inspector. Economics of supply and demand will decide the direction of the future. The trend is established I believe.

ST. LOUIS — A 2-year-old boy died Monday after police said he shot himself in the head in the parking lot of a store. The boy's father was later taken into custody.

The boy who police identified as Isreal Whirley shot himself just before noon in the parking lot of the AutoZone located at 3619 South Kingshighway Boulevard according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.

The AutoZone was still open as of 1 p.m. Monday. Many people continued to walk in and out of the shop while police were investigating the scene. The crime scene tape was cleared around 1:30 p.m.

According to investigators the boy was inside a car with his mother when he shot himself. The gun was located between the driver’s seat and the center console.

The boy’s parents took him to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Police said the boy’s father a 23-year-old man was taken into custody after he told officers the gun was his.

St. Louis police’s child abuse unit is investigating the incident.

Ali Khudier lives nearby and was at the AutoZone after the shooting happened.

He told 5 On Your Side it is heartbreaking this keeps happening to kids and it could be prevented.

""Everyone has guns now in Missouri because of the law but this is a big mistake. When the family the father or the mom they put the gun around the kids. This is what creates the problem. They should hide it somewhere or put it in a safe box or somewhere to not let the kids around it. That's what makes such a big problem around our city"" he said.

The toddler is the 103rd child under the age of 17 to be a victim of gun violence this year. According to 5 On Your Side data 13 children have died.

No additional information about the shooting was released.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3Mub3JhY2xlLmNvbS9zY20vcG9zdC9vcmFjbGUtcG93ZXJzLWF1dG9tb3RpdmUtaW5kdXN0cnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blog Theme - Details,"Automotive production is the largest manufacturing industry in the USA but automotive OEMs and suppliers face a complex set of issues. The challenges include transitioning business models to EV and subscription-based services rising cost of materials components and energy supply chain disruptions sustainability strategy and policy and constant time-to-market pressure.

Companies are looking for solutions to improve speed operations visibility and productivity across the enterprise. Oracle automotive solutions are powering performance and insight to help organizations navigate change with confidence. Here are a few examples of customer success.

Titan International

Titan International with its North American wheel operations based in Quincy Illinois manufactures heavy-duty wheels tires and undercarriage products for a variety of off-road equipment used in the agriculture construction forestry mining and military sectors across the globe.

But the company faced some major challenges: It had limited visibility into its production operations and it was unable to predict machine breakdowns on its factory floor both of which caused shipment delays and raised costs. Meanwhile Titan’s legacy ERP and supply chain management systems were expensive to upgrade and they lacked flexibility and scalability. The company needed a modern integrated cloud solution.

“We needed to move from multiple systems to a single platform that would give us better visibility into our business” says Jeff Blattner director of IT. “We wanted to standardize on an ERP system that could grow with us and ensure our systems are always up to date. Oracle Cloud applications give us access to constant innovation and enable us to benefit from emerging technology such as IoT to gain an advantage over the market.”

Honda

Honda and its group companies are adopting Oracle Fusion Cloud Procurement part of Oracle Cloud ERP to consolidate purchasing of indirect materials for their operations in Japan. Previously each company managed its own procurement systems and processes.

Standardizing on Oracle’s cloud procurement system enables Honda to adopt the latest best practices and centrally analyze data for the efficient use of corporate resources. This will enable better planning for future procurement strategies and increase agility to respond to changing external factors and minimize additional costs.

“By utilizing Oracle Cloud Procurement we aim to improve the efficiency of our indirect material operations optimize costs and shift to higher value-added operations” says Nobuyuki Hattori General Project Manager Interdepartmental Projects Honda Motor Co. Ltd. “We also appreciate that it is a SaaS application that enables us to comprehensively analyze spending of combined data from group companies is always updated with the latest technology and can be used in remote and paperless environments. We will continue to promote efforts to optimize our overall procurement operations.”

Mazda Logistics

Mazda Motor Logistics which handles distribution of Mazda cars and parts throughout Europe had a legacy warehouse management system that lacked a transportation management module leaving Mazda without visibility into its product shipments. The inability to ensure on-time deliveries not only risked customer satisfaction—it made it possible for parts made by competitors to take market share away from Mazda with non-Mazda-certified parts.

In the drive for transport excellence Mazda Motor Logistics brought together three solutions using Oracle Integration: Oracle E-Business Suite for order and inventory management; Oracle Warehouse Management for unloading staging and loading operations; and Oracle Transportation Management for transport management and container load planning.

Mazda Motor Logistics now has visibility from order to delivery and its export staff can see carrier bookings invoicing and billing without ever having to log out of the software. The company was able to eliminate Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access files from its processes and fully automate all transport bookings.

“By combining Oracle Transportation Management with Oracle Business Intelligence we're able to measure KPIs for our European distribution center and our regional warehouses. This allows us to compare the performance of our warehouses in the same way with the same KPIs.” — Kris Van Vossel Innovation Manager Mazda Motor Logistics

Mack Trucks

With the launch of the Mack Anthem highway truck its first major new product in about 15 years the company was looking to grow its over-the-road business. Its marketing team wanted to go big and bold with the campaign beyond the brochures print ads and industry trade shows that for decades had been its channels of choice when introducing a new product.

Those channels didn’t provide the opportunity Mack was looking for to craft and deliver different messages for different customers as measure the success of its outreach.

Mack’s marketing team shifted into a higher gear for the Anthem launch using Oracle Eloqua Marketing Automation part of the Oracle CX suite of cloud CRM applications to drive a digital marketing campaign that emphasized segmentation and metrics over mindshare.

Central to Mack Truck’s Anthem digital marketing campaign was the Oracle Eloqua database of more than 175000 customers and prospects. The marketing team used a range of creative content assets including gated YouTube videos and virtual reality tours of the highway truck courtesy of VR viewers distributed to potential customers. It used that content to engage some of those 175000-plus people and move them further and further through the sales funnel until they finally asked to talk with a Mack dealer. Oracle Eloqua’s lead scoring model was based partly on each person’s tagged engagement with other high-value content on Mack’s website as well as on an estimate of each person’s purchasing authority given his or her job role.

“[Oracle’s digital marketing tools] allow us to be more targeted more efficient and able to measure our activities in a far more effective way.”

— John Walsh Vice President of Marketing Mack Trucks

AutoZone

As AutoZone looked to hire thousands of new staffers during the coming decade to support its aggressive growth plans it realized it needed a modern human capital management system to help identify the right people as well as onboard manage and develop them.

The company implemented the Oracle Cloud HCM suite of applications to help it identify “AutoZoners” with the right stuff. AutoZone began with Oracle Cloud HCM’s talent management module and since then has implemented core HR payroll and absence management with employee and manager self-service.

During the first 30 days after it rolled out the Oracle Cloud HCM recruiting module AutoZone received 93000 job applications—more than four times the number it received during the same time the previous year.

A new responsive-design mobile app lets people apply for a job from their smartphones.

Avalon Studio 4121 Los Angeles

The property sold for $76 million which represents $510067 per unit.

“Located across the street from CBS Studio Center Avalon Studio 4121 is a high-quality institutionally maintained asset in one of Los Angeles County’s most affluent submarkets” said IPA Executive Director Kevin Green. He noted the property is one of only two 100-plus unit buildings built in the neighborhood in the past 15 years and said the area’s multifamily pipeline is extremely small.

Green and IPA Joseph Grabiec and Greg Harris represented seller Avalon Bay Communities Arlington Va. and procured buyer Gelt Inc. Tarzana Calif.

Grabiec noted the average multifamily occupancy in Studio City exceeds 96%. “The lack of nearby sites available for development insulates Avalon Studio 4121 from future competition” he said.

Located north of the Hollywood Hills Studio City near State Route 170/The Hollywood Freeway and U.S. Highway 101 two of central Los Angeles’ primary thoroughfares. The Universal City/Studio City Metro Station is within walking distance and many entertainment employers including NBC Universal Universal Studios and Crown Media Holdings are nearby. “There are more studio production spaces and sound stages in the area surrounding Avalon Studio 4121 than anywhere else in the world and many companies have plans for expansion” Grabiec noted.

Constructed in 2009 Avalon Studio 4121 is a two-building four-story asset with 120354 square feet of rentable area.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped about 4% to a five-week high on Friday lifted again by an OPEC+ decision this week to make its largest supply cut since 2020 despite concern about a possible recession and rising interest rates.

Oil rallied for the fifth day in a row even as the dollar moved higher after data showing the U.S. economy was creating jobs at a strong pace gave the Federal Reserve a reason to continue hefty interest rate hikes.

A strong greenback can pressure oil demand making dollar-denominated crude more expensive for other currency holders.

Brent futures rose $3.50 or 3.7% to settle at $97.92 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $4.19 or 4.7% to end at $92.64.

That was the highest close for Brent and WTI since Aug. 30. The price jump pushed both benchmarks into technically overbought territory for the first time since August for Brent and June for WTI.

Both contracts posted their second straight weekly gains and their biggest weekly percentage gains since March this week with Brent was up about 11% and WTI 17% higher.

U.S. heating oil futures jumped 19% this week to their highest close since June boosting the heating oil crack spread - a measure of refining profit margins - to its highest close on record according to Refinitiv data going back to December 2009.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia known as OPEC+ agreed this week to lower their output target by 2 million barrels per day.

""Among the key ramifications of OPEC's latest cut is a likely return of $100 oil"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.

UBS Global Wealth Management also projected Brent would ""move above the $100 bbl mark over the coming quarters.""

The OPEC+ cut comes ahead of a European Union embargo on Russian oil and will squeeze supply in an already tight market.

OPEC Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais said the output target cuts will leave OPEC+ with more supply to tap in the event of any crises.

On Thursday U.S. President Joe Biden expressed disappointment over the OPEC+ plans. He and U.S. officials said Washington was looking at all possible alternatives to keep prices from rising.

However the U.S. oil rig count an early indicator of future production fell by two this week to 602 according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Co as high inflation forces producers to spend more money to secure workers and equipment. [RIG/U]

""Oil futures prices are managing to gain upside traction even though widespread inflation across the U.S. and Europe is threatening the potential for a global recession where demand will likely take a sizeable hit"" analysts at energy consulting firm Gelber & Associates said.

In Europe divisions between EU leaders over capping gas prices and national rescue packages resurfaced with Poland accusing Germany of ""selfishness"" in its response to a winter energy crunch caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.

Favourites have disappeared from High Street technology has made some services redundant and popular nightclubs have made way for plush apartments.

Here's a little reminder of things you used to be able to do in Grimsby and Cleethorpes but can't anymore.

1. See the East Marsh high rise flats

Whether you were coming back from a day out in Cleethorpes or returning to the town along the A180 - the skyline was Grimsby's Dock Tower and the high rise flats.

The 10-acre East Marsh site once housed around 2000 people within the six blocks; Nelson House Garibaldi Thesiger House Tennyson House Albion and Bevan House.

The final resident left in November 2016 and preparations were made to clear the site with the blocks fully stripped on the inside removing any asbestos and other dangerous materials.

(Image: GrimsbyLive)

For demolition the six 16-Storey tower blocks were divided into two zones and a crew of 16 men led by site manager Greg Lawman from DSM Demolition made quick work of reducing the iconic structures to rubble.

Taking around six weeks to demolish each individual block the work was carried out from top to bottom until they reach the fourth floor of the building when the remainder was bulldozed and cleared away.

Demolition work began in April 2018 and the site was cleared by November before work on changing Freeman Street began in 2019.

2. Rent a DVD or game from Blockbuster

(Image: Abby Ruston)

The highlight of any dull weekday evening was staring at shelves upon shelves of videos DVDs and computer games to rent. It was sometimes a bit of a gamble if the latest release would be in stock or out for days on loan.

As an added bonus it was a one-stop shop where you could also snap up snacks such as popcorn and sweets and fizzy drinks to accompany your DVD of choice and if you really wanted a poster to match!

Blockbuster boasted it offered the largest range of home entertainment titles until it closed in December 2013 after the firm went bankrupt.

The company closed all of its UK stores after calling in the administrators for the second time that year. A St Andrew's Hospice charity shop now occupies the site near Lockhill roundabout in Grimsby.

3. Go to the Bags Ball at the Winter Gardens

(Image: Duncan Young)

This is a bit of a two in one given the Bags Ball was held at the Winter Gardens which was demolished in 2007 and is now a set of apartments. The venue itself was stunning particularly the chandeliers which draped over the dancefloor and its loss was a real shame for Cleethorpes.

The famous venue was designed in the 1920s as an amusement hall before a post-war refurbishment saw it reopen as the Winter Gardens ballroom in December 1947.

(Image: GrimsbyLive)

It was the home of entertainment in Cleethorpes for many years before it closed for good on February 15 2007 and was swiftly demolished just a few months later.

It had played faithful host to the popular Bags’ ball tea dances dinner/dances rock groups conferences exhibitions wedding receptions record fairs folk festival northern soul nights and boxing. A £10-million scheme for 47 new apartments was approved for the site and building began in summer 2010.

Progress was halted because of the economic downturn and restarted again in June 2015 before completion.

4. Catch a bus from the alphabet stands at the Riverhead

(Image: Rick Byrne)

The diagonal rows of alphabetical stands once formed the bus station area in the centre of town outside Freshney Place and was the main hub for passengers wishing to commute across town.

In January 2014 Grimsby bus station closed for two months as part of a £6m transformation of the town's transport system as new passenger shelters with real-time information displays were built at the Riverhead area.

Bus services stops were relocated to the Town Hall area and the library and a station hub created to house a cafe and information. Plans are currently on hold to create a £20million major leisure complex which was set to house a nine screen cinema and seven restaurants.

The site was recently the subject of controversy after it became a hive for anti-social behaviour and street drinking.

5. Shop or have a meal upstairs in BHS

It was store frequented by generations but in 2016 the BHS store on Victoria Street closed its doors.

BHS was originally founded in 1928 and had occupied Victoria Street since 1974 when it was part of the Riverhead Centre.

It was a favourite of mums for its good quality clothing lingerie and even sold school clothes. It was a place for your nanna to buy her long nighties and as a treat you could take the escalator or lift to the upper floor and eat lunch in the restaurant.

Ladies and childrens wear was downstairs with a small men's department upstairs.

The upper floor also housed home lighting accessories bath towels and bedding.

Coronation Street star Mikey North alias Gary Windass cut the ribbon to the new Poundland store (which incorporates a Pep&Co concession) that replaced BHS in April 2018.

6. Get the train to Louth

(Image: Grimsby Telegraph)

The East Lincolnshire Railway was a main line railway which linked the towns of Louth Grimsby and Boston and had opened in March 1848.

The original stations between Louth and Grimsby were Ludborough North Thoresby Holton-le-Clay with Tetney.

During 1924 most of the Grimsby fish trains were routed on the line so the fish could arrive quicker at its final destination.

In 1948 the line became part of British Railways following nationalisation. Grainsby was a small Victorian Halt and closed in 1952.

All intermediate stations except North Thoresby between Grimsby and Louth closed to passenger traffic on September 11 1961.

(Image: LWR)

North Thoresby and Louth stations closed on October 5 1970 but the line remained open to goods traffic from Grimsby to Louth Keddington Road for about ten years.

The double track was reduced to single until the final closure in December 1980. The track was lifted and all the station buildings and signal boxes were demolished and the line abandoned.

The year 1991 saw a Light Railway Order granted to the Great Northern & East Lincolnshire plc allowing Grimsby-Louth Railway Preservation Society to develop the line.

The Peaks Parkway project prevented the line being bought all the way to Grimsby but it left about ten miles of track that could be developed about five miles either side of Ludborough.

Today it's run by volunteers of the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway who have made tremendous improvements and an extension to the line for their two steam locomotives and two diesel shunters.

Peaks Parkway forms part of the northern end of the A16 to Louth and is a major traffic artery into and through Grimsby town centre - it was completed in October 1998.

7. Go for a wee in the Bullring sunken toilets

(Image: Submitted picture by Jeff Beedham)

The sunken toilets were located close to where Wilko's is now and were built sometime in November 1957.

A heavy pile driver being used while work was in progress at the Bull Ring Grimsby saw shopkeepers protesting about noise from the hammering.

They claimed that the machine preparing the way for the new £14000 underground public conveniences was driving away trade.

The large underground toilets were built on the east side of the Bull Ring and were usually flooded and closed during heavy rain.

The mens urinals were on the right and the women’s loos on the left with a low-rise wall and flowers around the circular venue.

The area was heavily redeveloped in the mid 1970s for the Riverhead shopping centre.

8. Go for a swim at Scartho baths

Home to many recreational swimmers and swimming clubs it had been built by the council in 1960 and called Grimsby Swimming Pool.

Although locals usually referred to it as “Scaffa baths” it closed on Sunday December 20 2015 just a few days before the new £8.4 million swimming pool in Cromwell Road Grimsby opened its doors.

Bulldozers began to demolish the building in July 2016 following the removal of asbestos from the Scartho Road buildings. It was planned to last 14 weeks and was completed by the first week of October 2016.

The cost of levelling the area was estimated to be around £1.2 million in total – including £498000 to clear the site and carry out isolation work and draining.

9. Drive all the way down Victoria Street

It's had four different names and you used to be able to drive all the way down it!

Victoria Street only changed its name when Queen Victoria came here in 1854 to see the Royal Dock.

Cars and trams once shared the busy thoroughfare but in 1992 following a public inquiry it was pedestrianised from Barclays Bank to the Old Market Place.

In 2004 it was revealed the remaining section of the street was to be pedestrianised. Trials of road closures from 10am to 6pm took place in April 2005.

Taxi drivers held protests in February 2006 followed by a public enquiry in June held at at Grimsby Town Hall. Bollards were introduced in January 2007 to prevent members of the public driving through (with the exception of delivery vehicles).

Britcon was awarded the renovation project by North East Lincolnshire Council and the works began in 2007-2008.

The 35-week project involved granite paving hard landscaping decorative lighting/LED illumination and creating a Wi-Fi zoned area. Fountains were also added in the Old Market Place area.

10. Drink a pint of blastaway in JDs Nightscene

The sweeping building was located on the corner of High Cliff and Sea View Street in Cleethorpes - today people will recognise the high-rise apartment complex called 'The Point'.

Previously known as Deans and later JDs Nightscene it was very popular nightclub in the 1980s and 1990s. It featured television screens showing music videos two staircases and two dance floors with a viewing area from the upper floor.

A queue would form from the main entrance aluminium clad/submarine porthole doors and around the corner a very blustery corner in the winter months! The exterior was painted in a variety of colours over the years including lilac and a lurid green.

Popular drinks included getting a pint of blastaway (a mix of diamond white cider and castaway) for about £2/3 or cider and black. There were toilets on both levels and cigarette machines.

It was knocked down during 2003-4 to make way for redevelopment and the luxury apartments.

11. Buy an outfit from C&A

Popular clothing store C&A in Freshney Place Grimsby traded in the town for 10 years before closing in December 2001. It was the place to go for budget fashion for teens through to adults. It had everything in the 1990s from MC Hammer style trousers to winter coats and jewellery.

In June 2000 C&A announced it was to close all 113 of its UK stores with the loss of 4800 jobs. These days the unit is now occupied by Next but C&A stores can still be found abroad in European countries including France Spain and the Amsterdam.

12. Dance around your handbag at The Flamingo or Jezebels

(Image: Grimsby Telegraph)

Located opposite the Beachcomber and standing on the site of what is now The Trawlerman pub in Humberston - the Flamingo Club of Flam as it was known was a popular night club. In 1975 women seeking a night out at the Flamingo were allowed in free on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

After 10pm on Wednesdays and Fridays they needed to find 20p for admission while on Saturday it would cost them 75p. It attracted celebrities of the day such as Radio 1 DJs popstar Sinitta comedians Roy Chubby Brown and Bernard Manning and The Real Thing.

Customers would dance the night away to the likes of George Benson Luther Vandross Shalamar Marvin Gaye and Sister Sledge. It was also briefly known as Jezebels around 1993. The Flamingo was so popular it used to have as many as 800 people in with queues forming at 8.30pm and stretching all the way around the car park!

Since its closure regular reunion nights have been held around the town for punters to reminisce.

13. Buy meat from Pettits

Another Grimsby institution was the award-winning butchers John Pettit & Sons with its trademark red and white striped canopy. The sudden closure of the Bethlehem Street butchers surprised many coming in October 2017 just two months after a milestone 125-year anniversary celebration.

It cited “loss of significant contracts to supply the catering trade from which it has been unable to recover” as the reason for closure. A total of 12 people lost their jobs in the fourth-generation business.

In November 2017 an online auction took place to sell off everything from carrier bags to sausage filling machines a mincer grinder and a forklift truck! For generations there were queues leading out of the door to get Lincolnshire sausages bacon and their pork pies and prime cuts of meat - putting them in the distinctive monochrome carrier bags.

It operated a Christmas savings stamp scheme and sold vouchers for its award-winning meats.

14. Watch a movie at the Odeon on Freeman Street

(Image: Ray Corke)

Before Parkway Cinema in Cleethorpes everyone ventured to the cinema on Freeman Street which fell under many names including Odeon The Regal and ABC. In the late 1970s the cinema was made into a three-screen venue - number one screen seated 450 number two – 238 and number three – 128. With the demise of ABC Cinemas it had various owners including EMI Cannon MGM and Virgin.

In late 1996 ABC was reformed and once again reclaimed ownership before it became an Odeon in 2001 following a £100000 re-branding scheme. It showed hundreds of the blockbusters movies and popular titles of the day including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Harry Potter Shrek Lord Of The Rings Monsters Inc and more.

Sadly by December 2004 it was in trouble and closed its doors. A company unsuccessfully put it up for auction in 2006 and neighbouring Kwik Save supermarket (formerly the cinema’s stalls) subsequently closed in May 2007.

In 2008 it went to auction once again and a Shropshire businessman bought and renovated it opening it as the Regal Cinema in August 2009 although it closed just a month later. On June 14 2012 the iconic cinema went under the hammer with a guide price of £295000 and the former supermarket was redeveloped for a brief time as a skate park and climbing wall venue Ghetto Park.

In 2018 Arena Airsoft Grimsby took over the former cinema and Ghetto Park to create an Airsoft Nerf gun and laser tag arena.

15. Get pick n' mix from Woolworths

(Image: Grimsby Telegraph)

Woolworths was a staple in high streets up and down the country and Grimsby was no exception. Not only did it offer baby and children's clothing but it had a music and entertainment department a stationery section garden furniture and everything in between.

One of the highlights was their large pick n' mix sweet selection paper bags could be crammed to the brim for a reasonable price - only Wilko's was cheaper nearby. The firm went into administration in 2009 with the closure of all its 807 stores in the UK with a loss of 27000 jobs.

The Victoria Street building became a New Look clothing store and is now Poundland whilst the Cleethorpes branch is a Boyes department store.

16. Enjoy a meal aboard Lincoln Castle

(Image: Rick Byrne)

Once moored next to the Fishing Heritage Centre it soon gained a reputation for excellent food and attracted numerous visitors to the museum.

The year 1978 saw the Lincoln Castle purchased and converted to a pub/restaurant on Hessle foreshore near the new Humber Bridge. It then moved to Immingham in 1987 for refurbishment. You could enjoy a Sunday dinner a fish n chip lunch or simply sup a pint aboard the former ferry.

Many local clubs and societies held dinners and presentations aboard the beautiful paddle steamer. The 598-ton ferry was built in Scotland for the London & North Eastern Railway and sailed south in 1941 from the River Clyde on her maiden voyage until a dry dock inspection in 1977 revealed the boiler had suffered severe structural deterioration.

She was the last coal-fired paddle steamer in commercial operation and could carry 20 cars and 914 passengers.

On May 17 2010 despite the Johnson family’s best efforts to save her with an asking price of £20000 it was made even more difficult by NELC imposing an additional £60000 bond on the purchase price of the vessel.

The Johnson family had no option but to contact demolition contractors H Cope & Sons to begin demolition. Piece by piece the unique ferry was taken apart.

17. Catch a tram or trolleybus to Cleethorpes

The Cleethorpes transport depot on Pelham Road served all the electric trams that operated on the whole of the route.

From People’s Park Grimsby to Albert Road Cleethorpes and the route down Freeman Street and Hainton Avenue.

The depot came into use in 1901 with the opening of the electric tramway and in 1925 Grimsby Corporation took over the tramway within its area. Then in 1934 it also took over the Provincial Tramways bus services and vehicles in its Borough.

Before that horse-drawn trams served the local area in the 1880s; using standard gauge single track line with passing loops stretching from the depot in Park Street on the Grimsby and Cleethorpes boundary to the Wheatsheaf Inn on Bargate.

In 1887 the route was extended to Kingsway in Cleethorpes before being extended up Isaac’s Hill to terminate on Cleethorpes seafront in 1898.

The Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway ran in the area from 1912 until 1961 bringing people from Grimsby to the port at Immingham and used to service over a million passengers a year at its busiest.

The line from the old market to Cleethorpes remained open until it was replaced by 10 trolley buses on November 22 1936 (from the Old Market to the Borough boundary at Park Street).

Finally the depot was closed as a transport depot on March 2 1957 when following the amalgamation of the Grimsby and Cleethorpes Transport departments the operation moved to the Grimsby Corporation depot in Victoria Street.

The Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway was the last English tramway to be completely abandoned on July 1 1961. Motor buses subsequently replaced the trolleybuses.

18. Ride a rollercoaster at Pleasure Island

Pleasure Island Theme Park in Cleethorpes closed at the end of the 2016 season after 23 years of business.

Competition from the big parks a downturn in the economy and eventually rotten weather in its last summer signalled the end.

Highlights of rides had included The Boomerang which caused queues at the park. It was a quick thrill. Dragged up backwards before being let go at the top to shoot back down the ramp and through two half loops and one complete loop.

It took less than two minutes and then you did it backwards!

A last ride on the Boomerang

The Gravitron was a hand-me-down from Alton Towers and the only one in the UK.

The space-themed ride saw visitors boarding a ""spaceship"" before the doors closed. You leaned against one of the 48 padded panels before the spinning started pinning you against the wall by the centrifugal force.

A big draw was the daily sea lion show – always a crowd pleaser with trio Bonnie Clive and Zac.

Intelligent and fun to work with trainers enjoyed teaching them new tricks to please visitors each season. They were trained on the principle of reward and praise and they soon learned which actions resulted in a tasty treat - enthusiastic learners very affectionate creatures and givers of very fishy kisses.

19. Shopping at House of Fraser

(Image: Rick Byrne / GrimsbyLive)

Grimsby’s House of Fraser closed its doors in July 2020 - ending an era serving generations of shoppers.

It was due to close at the end of March but with the coronavirus lockdown the sale of the remaining stock was delayed.

The huge three-storey building is due to reopen as one the first stores by new concession operator 15-17.

Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic it was said the “new retail experience” will be led by up to 25 of House of Fraser’s staff.

The Dune and Caffe Nero that are both found within the store closed earlier.

The department store had originally been due to close down in January 2019 when the previous owner C-Banner entered into a CVA restructure.

(Image: Rick Byrne / GrimsbyLive)

But the store was saved at the end of 2018 when Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley bought the high street chain for £90m.

Then in December 2019 Frasers Group confirmed that the store was indeed closing down at the cost of more than 40 jobs.

In a statement at the time Frasers Group said: ""The Group had been working closely with the landlord for some time on a solution to keep the store open.

“Over that time the landlord has not charged rent but the day-to-day operating costs of the store have been considerable not least the business rates but keeping the store open was no longer viable.

""We are thankful to the landlord for working with us over the past few months to try to find a long-term solution for the store.

""It has only been through the joint efforts of both Frasers Group and the landlord in question that the store has remained open for a long as it has.""

Offered in conjunction with Banked Ltd. the roll-out follows the U.K. launch of Pay by Bank in February this year and lets eCommerce shoppers pay directly from their bank account Bank of America (BofA) said in a news release emailed to PYMNTS.

Based on the concept of open banking Pay by Bank transactions take place in real-time with no credit or debit card details necessary. BofA said this leads to a “fast and secure online checkout process that benefits consumers as well as merchants.”

As PYMNTS has noted proponents of Pay by Bank say the payment option is streamlined and more secure as it eliminates much of the data merchants need to store about their customers. And because the funds are deducted from a person’s bank account customers avoid paying credit card fees.

“Pay by Bank is a great example of how we develop technology with our clients’ business models top of mind” said Chris Jameson head of Product Management GTS EMEA at Bank of America. “For example the Pay by Bank interface can be adapted by European market location and country which in turn optimizes the local user experience.”

Earlier this year BofA led a $20 million funding round for Banked to widen Pay by Bank’s reach PYMNTS reported in February.

Last week BofA announced it was adding $100 million in low-cost deposits to minority depository institutions (MDIs) doubling its existing deposits in those institutions.

The bank said these low-cost deposits let MDIs expand their lending capacity and other banking services in minority and low- to moderate-income communities.

“It is well recognized that MDIs are a critical resource to minority and underserved communities by providing banking services creating jobs and helping businesses grow” Bank of America Chief Administrative Officer D. Steve Boland said.

We stock our carts in-store and online and fill our pantries and fridges on autopilot—often without stopping to consider what life would be like without this kind of convenience.

Asmeret Berhe-Lumax paused to take stock.

While volunteering for a Brooklyn New York food bank Berhe-Lumax (pronounced Ber-hee Loo-Max) had a day that changed her life. ""Within two hours there were 400 families in line for food"" she says. ""It's one thing to read about the number of people dealing with food insecurity but it's an eye-opening experience to see it for yourself. The pantries were completely overwhelmed—and I felt compelled to do something.""

A Simple Plan for a Big Impact

In July 2020 Berhe-Lumax set up a community fridge in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. A private donor contributed a new appliance and Berhe-Lumax found a local store that allowed her to place it out front and connect it to their power source via extension cord. ""It was basic; most of us have a refrigerator at home"" she says. ""The solution was right there."" Berhe-Lumax didn't stop at setting up the fridge. She and her two daughters now 12 and 14 shopped daily stocking it seven days a week with their own funds. Soon they realized they could help activate their friends family and community to do the same.

Jillian Guyette

The former fashion industry executive enlisted anyone and everyone willing to help and what was once a well-intentioned hobby quickly turned into a movement. Today One Love Community Fridge services 20 fridges across Brooklyn and Manhattan providing access to free fresh nutritious food while working toward a more sustainable and equitable world. The 501(c)3 nonprofit partners with farmers community gardens and others who share in its values: ""When we stock the fridges we try to look at them as an extension of our dinner table"" says Berhe-Lumax.

Leading With Respect

A big part of One Love Community Fridge's movement is to lead with dignity and destigmatize the struggle. ""We're creating communities where everybody has the opportunity to be the best person they can be"" Berhe-Lumax explains. To that end instead of policing each refrigerator the organization stocks them and leaves them for the community to manage themselves. ""The idea is for people to come and take what they need"" she says. ""It's not about singling out anyone who needs support—it's about coming together.""

""When we stock the fridges we try to look at them as an extension of our dinner table.""

Leaving the refrigerators unattended might seem counterproductive but as the nonprofit leader explains consistency is the key to efficiency. ""If you don't usually have access to something and all of a sudden it's there for you and it's free the first initial response would be to try to take everything. But what we've seen is by showing up being consistent and building a long-term initiative it changes a cultural mindset rather than simply adding a bandage"" she explains. ""And people really take pride in the fridges—cleaning them and working together to make sure everything is fair.""

Contributing Connection

Berhe-Lumax wants to change the traditional meaning of charity. Along with erasing the stigma associated with food insecurity she hopes people know that they can volunteer no matter how much or how little they have to give. ""There's space for you to either share your time or financial support with no restrictions"" she says.

Jillian Guyette

One Love's first refrigerator was purchased by a generous donor but contributions of any size can make a difference in your community. You can start small—with a fresh grocery haul—then expand your efforts and sponsor a fridge or two of your own.

When you do you might just start a chain reaction. The more people who make it a priority to help others whether by donating money or time the more fellow philanthropists they inspire. Berhe-Lumax reports that those who first needed support from One Love are now involved in the process—adding value and working toward a solution. ""We're creating communities where everybody has the opportunity to be the best person they can be"" she says. BNY Mellon Wealth Management can help you build a strong financial foundation so you can grow your influence and make a greater impact in your community. In-house experts consider both your financial future and charitable pursuits (such as retirement goals and environmental causes) when developing your personalized wealth management plan. Their ""Do Well Better"" campaign highlights their clients who are making a difference and giving back to their communities just like Berhe-Lumax.

At the end of the day says Berhe Lumax ""it's about creating relationships with people so that they care for the world they live in and the people who live in it.""

And that is always time and money well spent.

As previously reported the platform was officially recognized by HM Treasury as a systemically important payment system in August which means the Bank is its regulator.

The payment platform is designed to support the settlement of tokenized assets. From the start it planned to be multi-currency including Sterling Euro US Dollar Yen and Canadian Dollar.

A former Fnality director Santander’s John Whelan recently stated on Linkedin that we should see Fnality support GBP Euro USD in 2023. Fnality confirmed that it is progressing with its launch of wholesale payments in the US and Europe from “2023 onwards”. Our sources have said the Fnality Euro is advancing reinforced by Euroclear investing earlier this year.

On the other hand in the last three to four months the European Central Bank (ECB) has started to talk about the possibility of a wholesale CBDC. But that doesn’t preclude the launch of Fnality Europe. Technically Fnality is a synthetic CBDC – a Fnality central bank account will back the currencies hence the need for central bank buy-in. On the other side of the Atlantic Fnality participated in a DLT initiative Project Ion run by the DTCC in the United States.

From a timing perspective 2023 makes sense because that’s when DLT initiatives will ramp up. The UK is launching its FMI sandbox next year and the EU’s DLT Pilot regime comes online in March. The latter allows the limited waiver of certain EU regulations such as permitting direct access to retail investors and supporting a single platform for both trading and settlement of digital securities.

Meanwhile Fnality is in the process of raising additional funding with Nomura joining recently as its latest investor.

The full list of Fnality investors is Banco Santander Bank of New York Mellon Barclays CIBC Commerzbank Credit Suisse Euroclear ING KBC Group Lloyds Banking Group Mizuho MUFG Group Nasdaq Nomura SMBC State Street and UBS.

Last week Fnality and Finteum the DLT-based FX Swaps platform announced a successful proof of concept for interoperability between their platforms. Fnality runs a separate network for each currency and uses a permissioned variant of the Ethereum blockchain. Finteum’s platform is based on the R3 Corda enterprise blockchain. It settled the USD and GBP legs of the FX Swap on the two separate FnPS networks in a payment versus payment transaction.

Finteum is expecting to go live in Q2-Q3 2023 initially expecting to settle outside Fnality with three banks signed up so far.

Update: Added clarification that the Finteum go-live is initially expecting to settle outside Fnality",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEwLTEwL2Fwb2xsby1tYWtlcy1xdWljay1nYWlucy1vbi1jbG9zLWR1bXBlZC1ieS11ay1wZW5zaW9uLWZ1bmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apollo Makes Quick Gains on Bonds Dumped by UK Pension Funds,"Why did this happen?

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong.

Mayor Darrel Olson gave a mayoral proclamation acknowledging the Monday Oct. 10 holiday during the Oct. 4 city council meeting.

“The city of Baxter recognizes Indigenous-American Peoples’ Day on the second Monday in October as a day to reflect on our history and to celebrate the thriving culture and value that the Indigenous nations add to our region” Olson said.

The idea first came to Olson from Darrell Pedersen. Pedersen is a retired pastor who is still involved in the community. One of the groups Pedersen is part of is the Indigenous Peoples Planning Task Force which was jumpstarted by Lowell Johnson.

Indigenous Peoples Day is a federal holiday but it is not formally recognized by every state in the United States. According to the Associated Press President Joe Biden was the first president to issue a presidential proclamation of Indigenous Peoples Day in 2021. Though the holiday was originally suggested in 1977 it still is not fully recognized across the country.

The holiday is considered by many to be a counter-celebration to Columbus Day a federal holiday in honor of Christopher Columbus the Italian explorer who landed in the “New World” in 1492. Criticism of Columbus and his actions — along with the treatment of Indigenous populations during the colonization of the Americas and after — drive the desire of some to celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day instead.

Biden also issued a proclamation of Columbus Day in 2021 praising the role of Italian-Americans in U.S. society while referencing the harm done by Columbus and other early explorers.

“I think the average person thinks that a racist is someone who says or does bad things to people of a different race but that isn't it at all” Pedersen said. “I'm a racist. I try to be respectful and helpful etc. But there are certain things that I just don't know any better in or whatever. And I'm trying to learn how to do a better job of being a loving caring fellow.”

The Indigenous Peoples Planning Task Force began meeting in May and had a fairly slow start due to new members joining the organization.

“Each time we met we'd have new people and so then you have to stop and get to know them” said Pat Dickson a volunteer for the Indigenous Peoples Planning Task Force.

The group meets monthly and there are a wide variety of organizations involved in the task force. The group has support from Habitat for Humanity Crow Wing Energized United Way and many more.

Pedersen reached out to Olson to see if the city of Baxter would formally acknowledge the holiday. From there the two met a couple of times to discuss the situation.

“He was most cordial and open to the conversation” Pedersen said.

The Indigenous Peoples Task Force has around 64 members and is working to educate others about Indigenous people and their history. Northeastern Minnesota has a high population of Indigenous people and recognizing them is important to the group members said.

The task force planned an education event at 2:30 p.m. Oct. 30 at Brainerd High School. The “Blanket Exercise” is an interactive demonstration of how Native American land was taken away.

“It's participatory learning” Dickson said. “You're moving your body as well as taking it in with your mind.”

Blankets will be spread across the gymnasium floor and people who attend will receive a card describing a certain person. They are then asked to stand on a certain blanket and as the exercise goes on more and more blankets are removed.

While talks have been ongoing for some time an agreement isn’t likely for a few weeks and the deal still may fall through according to the report.

Spokespersons at both companies weren’t immediately available to comment when contacted by MedTech Dive.

Hercules Calif.-based Bio-Rad makes various products for the life science research and clinical diagnostic markets. It has a market capitalization of just under $12 billion. Qiagen is a Germany-based diagnostics company with a market capitalization of about $10 billion.

Thermo Fisher attempted to buy Qiagen in 2020 in a deal that was initially valued at $11.5 billion. That transaction fell apart after failing to secure support from Qiagen’s shareholders. Thermo Fisher went on to acquire research contractor PPD last year for $17.4 billion.

The report of a Bio-Rad tie up with Qiagen comes amid a lull of medtech mergers and acquisitions following a spending spree last year. Notable acquisitions this year include Stryker’s $3 billion purchase of Vocera Communications ResMed’s approximately $1 billion pickup of MediFox Dan and Becton Dickinson’s $1.53 billion purchase of Parata Systems.

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.78%) (BRK.B 0.64%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.02% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ2MTNiYWQxLTI3YTAtNGEyMy04N2Y2LWEzNjQzNTAyNThjN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire and Tesla resist making political spending disclosures,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Legendary investor Warren Buffett may have finally met his match in Nancy Pelosi — at least in Donald Trump's view.

""Look at her stocks"" the former US president said about the House speaker during a Republican rally in Arizona on Sunday according to The Hill. ""I mean she did better than Warren Buffett.""

Pelosi regularly discloses investments made by Paul Pelosi her husband and the head of an investment firm. He's made several high-profile bets during the pandemic including Tesla Alphabet Nvidia and Crowdstrike.

However Pelosi's office has repeatedly emphasized that the lawmaker herself doesn't own any individual stocks and has no prior knowledge of her husband's dealings.

""I don't know about her husband"" Trump said. ""I don't know who the hell's running that deal.""

Trump said Pelosi is slow-walking legislation that would ban members of Congress and other government officials from owning or trading specific stocks and impose stiffer penalties for violating federal conflict-of-interest laws. Pelosi shared a draft of the bill in late September but hasn't yet put it to a vote.

""And now she doesn't want to change it where they're allowed to get inside information"" Trump said about the delay. His latest comments echo his declaration in January that it isn't right or appropriate for Pelosi to trade individual stocks given her access to details of upcoming legislation.

Pelosi's supposed trading prowess has become a popular meme on finance forums with some amateur investors hailing her as the ""Queen of Stonks"" and mimicking her husband's picks. Online trackers of her investment disclosures have sprouted up and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) mirroring her investments are in the works.

Trump has traded barbs with Buffett in recent years. In 2016 he accused the Berkshire Hathaway CEO of taking a ""massive"" tax deduction and carrying forward losses to lower his federal-income tax bill. Buffett responded that he's never carried forward any losses and published the details of his latest tax return to prove Trump wrong.

Buffett himself took aim at Trump while stumping for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential run. For example he ridiculed the real estate tycoon for bragging about his bankruptcies and shamed him for losing virtually all of his backers' money.

Trump spoke somewhat more kindly about the investor while in office.

""He's been right his whole life but sometimes even someone like Warren Buffett — I have a lot of respect for him — they make mistakes"" he said about the billionaire's decision to dump Berkshire's stakes in the ""Big Four"" US airlines in April 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9qYWNrc29udmlsbGUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL3EtYS13aXRoLWtldmluLXdhdWdhbWFuLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Waugaman of Berkshire Hathaway: Let lifestyle not market trends dictate real estate decisions - Jacksonville ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2022/10/10/q-a-with-kevin-waugaman.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9qYWNrc29udmlsbGUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL3EtYS13aXRoLWtldmluLXdhdWdhbWFuLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3RyYWRlcnUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvY3VycmVudC1jaGFybGllLW11bmdlci1wb3J0Zm9saW8tMjAyMi1xMi11cGRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Current Charlie Munger Portfolio 2022: Q2 Update,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newtraderu.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/10/09/current-charlie-munger-portfolio-2022-q2-update/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA22B5B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3RyYWRlcnUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvY3VycmVudC1jaGFybGllLW11bmdlci1wb3J0Zm9saW8tMjAyMi1xMi11cGRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Matt has been with Schwab for 13 years and is a Branch Manager in Fort Worth and Southlake TX. When he first joined Schwab he had yet to come out to his family and peers and started the process not knowing what to expect.

“I might not have come out if it wasn’t for the amazing leaders I’ve worked with along the way” says Matt. “They created an inclusive space for me to be visible on my terms and that’s been meaningful throughout my journey.”

Buildout to Reach OVER 4700 Homes and Small Businesses in Wexford County

TRAVERSE CITY Mich. — Spectrum today announced construction is underway on a fiber-optic network expansion project that will bring gigabit broadband and other Spectrum services to over 4700 homes and small businesses in Wexford County Michigan. Spectrum services are available to some residents and small business owners in the buildout area beginning today.

The buildout is part of Spectrum’s approximately $5 billion investment in unserved rural areas which includes more than $1 billion won in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) auction. The company’s RDOF expansion will provide broadband access to approximately 1 million customer locations as estimated by the FCC across 24 states in the coming years.

“Broadband is a vital resource for work learning and personal connection” said Thomas Yates Vice President of Construction leading Spectrum’s Michigan and Indiana buildouts. “Leveraging resources won in the RDOF auction we’re building a high-speed high-capacity network that will bring gigabit internet to thousands of homes and small businesses in Wexford County — an investment that will ensure families and businesses can participate fully in the digital world now and well into the future.”

“Many Michiganders remain unserved with no internet access at home” said U.S. Representative John Moolenaar “Spectrum’s network expansion through the FCC’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will bring access and opportunity to families and students and boost our economy that keeps people working.”

State Senator Curt VanderWall states “I’ve been a longtime supporter of expanding internet access to Michigan’s rural residents. Spectrum’s expansion into Michigan’s 35th Senate District will bring high-speed access to many families so they can access health care education and entertainment from the comfort of home.”

“Michigan’s rural population needs access to reliable internet now more than ever” said State Representative Michele Hoitenga “Home internet allows Michigan’s rural residents to access telemedicine work remotely and participate in virtual learning.”

ANCHORAGE Alaska Oct. 10 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Affordable reliable high-speed internet is coming to Western Alaska! Bethel Native Corporation (BNC) in partnership with GCI Alaska's largest telecommunications company today announced the launch of a partnership to bring fiber-optic connectivity to Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The project will bring 2 gigabit internet speeds and affordable plans to more than 10000 Alaskans.



At an event held in Anchorage at the Alaska Native Heritage Center on Indigenous Peoples' Day the partners announced more than $73 million in broadband grants recently awarded by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) and the USDA's Rural Utilities Service ReConnect program.



The partners announced the new project name the Airraq Network (pronounced EYE-huck). Airraq a traditional Yup'ik game similar to cat's cradle translates to ""string that tells the story.""

ABOUT THE GRANTS

The Bethel Native Corporation has been awarded a $42 million grant from the NTIA to build a fiber network to Bethel Platinum Eek Napaskiak and Oscarville.

The 405-mile network will start in Dillingham  follow a submarine route to the mouth of the Kuskokwim River and then transition to an overland route to Bethel .

 follow a submarine route to the mouth of the Kuskokwim River and then transition to an overland route to . As BNC's subgrantee partner GCI will construct and operate the fiber network.

GCI will upgrade its existing cable plant in Bethel and deploy fiber-to-the-premises local access networks in the four other communities.

and deploy fiber-to-the-premises local access networks in the four other communities. Consumers in these communities will have access to 2 gig consumer broadband service plans that include unlimited data and affordable prices. Customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program will be eligible for free internet service.

The service is scheduled to launch in Bethel at the end of 2024.

at the end of 2024. The Bethel fiber project will connect in Dillingham to another NTIA-funded fiber project to be constructed by Nushagak Telephone which in turn connects to an USDA RUS-funded fiber network that connects to Anchorage . By leveraging other federal investment BNC and GCI are using every NTIA Bethel grant dollar in the most efficient way possible.

GCI has been awarded a $31 million USDA RUS ReConnect grant to construct long-haul fiber and local fiber in the Y-K Delta communities of Atmautluak Kasigluk Nunapitchuk Quinhagak and Tuntutuliak.

GCI will construct and operate the fiber and will deploy fiber-to-the-premises local access networks in the five communities.

Consumers in these communities will receive 2 gig consumer broadband service plans that include access to unlimited data and affordable prices. Customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program will be eligible for free internet service.

This project will connect to the Bethel fiber leveraging federal dollars in an efficient way.

""The residents of the 10 grant communities are now looking forward to faster speeds more data and having much more affordable plans in the coming years"" said BNC President & CEO Ana Hoffman. ""The people of the Y-K Delta are resourceful respectful and resilient. We have a strong sense of community and we depend upon collaboration with our friends and neighbors to be successful. We know the value of presence and that is why I have so much confidence in this partnership between BNC and GCI and our collective commitment to deliver this service together.""

""Ana is fond of saying 'a first-class people deserve a first-class internet service.' We couldn't agree more"" said GCI President & COO Greg Chapados. ""GCI pledges to the people of the Y-K Delta our partner BNC and NTIA and RUS that we will build and operate a first-rate network that will not just narrow but eliminate the rural-urban digital divide for the 10000-plus residents of Bethel and the other served communities.""

In addition to Indigenous and community stakeholders the push for federal support of Alaska's broadband projects including the Airraq Network also received broad support from state and federal leaders.

""I was a big supporter of these projects and am thrilled about this announcement"" said Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy. ""These types of infrastructure projects are some of the most important investments in Alaska today. These projects will finally bring high-speed affordable internet to homes businesses schools and health care facilities. High-speed broadband service will attract more investment in Alaska; it will grow our economy. Most importantly it will create more job opportunities for our youth in the communities where they live.""

""Congratulations to Bethel Native Corporation and to all the villages in the area that are going to stand to benefit from this expansion of broadband"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski. ""We've been working hard on the infrastructure bill doing everything that we can to try to help facilitate through NTIA these grants and opportunities that will be coming to really connect all of Alaska and most particularly rural Alaska. From Kasigluk to Eek you're going to see benefits. This is good reason for celebration and I'm glad to be part of it.""

""Access to high-speed reliable internet can be life-changing for a community enhancing the delivery of health care and education and opening doors for small businesses and entrepreneurs"" said Sen. Dan Sullivan. ""Many of our rural Alaska Native communities for too long have found themselves without the broadband connectivity that most Americans take for granted. I'm glad to see the significant federal infrastructure dollars we secured being deployed to break down the digital divide and improve the lives and wellbeing of thousands of Alaskans across the Lower Kuskokwim region.""

""On this Indigenous Peoples' Day I'm honored to join you in celebrating the NTIA and USDA awards to Bethel Native Corporation and GCI"" said Rep. Mary Peltola. ""With this funding fiber service will be brought to residents in 10 communities including Bethel my home. My kids and I can't wait to enjoy the service we will have there once it's constructed. And the name for the network is just perfect.""

""It was a real pleasure to be able to visit with so many of you in August"" said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson recalling his trip to Western Alaska over the summer. ""I was honored on that trip to meet with so many community members in places like Napaskiak and Napakiak and Bethel to hear firsthand from leading educators and health professionals. It was honestly humbling for me and for our team that was there to hear firsthand to see the real connectivity challenges that people are facing on the ground and the real impacts that these grants could make. We know that delivering connectivity to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is critical as we were hearing; access to jobs healthcare education all the things that your community needs but as you so clearly showed us on this visit this is not just about bringing the internet to the Y-K Delta this is also about bringing you all your communities your local knowledge your beautiful culture to the broader internet community. And for that I think we are all going to be very grateful.""

""It's incredible this big lift and USDA Rural Development is so thrilled to just be a piece of that federal funding and we're so excited to be working alongside tribes municipalities and telecommunications companies like GCI to connect really remote and rural communities"" said USDA Rural Development State Director for Alaska Julia Hnilicka. ""I've had the honor to go out to the Y-K Delta a few times this summer and I have just been as a lifelong Alaskan so blown away by the beauty and the complexity of culture and I'm beyond-words-thrilled to be a part of even a small part of sharing that culture with the world. Internet connectivity is not just about what it brings in but what we are able to share out from Alaska as well.""

""It has truly been my honor to work with the Bethel Native Corporation as well as GCI as we've worked through the process of bringing this application forward to fruition"" said NTIA Division Chief Tribal Connectivity and Nation to Nation Coordination Adam Geisler. ""We're entering an age now where access to affordable reliable broadband service is going to be at your fingertips here in the very near future and again I want to emphasize affordability.""

Under the agreement MidOcean will acquire Tokyo Gas’ stakes in the Gorgon Ichthys Pluto and Queensland Curtis LNG projects.

Spread over the western and eastern seaboard of Australia the four LNG projects are claimed to be major suppliers to Asian countries with a set of long-dated take or pay contracts with investment grade counterparties.

EIG expects the portfolio to generate nearly one million tonnes per annum of LNG net for MidOcean Energy.

EIG chairman and CEO R Blair Thomas said: “The launch of MidOcean reflects our deep belief in LNG as a critical enabler of the energy transition and the growing importance of LNG as a geopolitically strategic energy resource.

“We believe this transaction provides MidOcean with a foundational portfolio of cost-advantaged integrated LNG assets in a low-risk jurisdiction ideally positioned to supply key customers in Japan Asia and across the globe for decades to come.”

The portfolio of LNG projects benefits from experienced operators such as Woodside Chevron Inpex and Shell.

The portfolio also spans the LNG value chain starting from upstream operations to midstream liquefaction and sales.

The deal forms part of MidOcean’s strategy to create a diversified global ‘pure play’ integrated LNG player.

MidOcean Energy CEO De la Rey Venter said: “With today’s announcement MidOcean is taking the first step toward realising its vision to build a material pure play LNG business that we expect will support the world’s transition to a net-zero future.

“We see a number of opportunities to further expand MidOcean’s position in supplying LNG markets around the world and look forward to working with our new partners and customers.”

For Tokyo Gas the sale is part of its strategy to review its asset portfolio to allocate funds to growth areas.

Subject to Australian regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions the deal is planned to close in H1 2023."

We know how much mobile ordering and delivery has surged since the pandemic. But what’s the next restaurant tech wave?

Here Come the Robots

One answer is automation and robots. Robots can provide many benefits in the kitchen if they are implemented correctly. For one they can fill multiple orders quickly and accurately which can improve customer service.

“There is a lot of buzz about robotics and technologies that can automate repetitive tasks such as flipping hamburgers for example” says Erik Szyndlar a managing director at Harris Williams. “In their quest for profitability restaurant companies are beginning to look at operations inside the restaurant that could be automated and at potential third-party solutions to do that. For the most part these solutions are in early stages and attracting largely venture capital investment but it is certainly an area for private equity to watch.”

Strategic buyers are investing in startups to help their operations too. In July 2022 Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) invested in Hyphen which makes a robotics system called Makeline. The latter assembles digital orders under the counter through automation production while allowing staff to assemble in-house orders from the top of the counter. Chipotle made the investment out of its Cultivate Next venture fund.

Filling in the Labor Gaps

The restaurant industry like many others has been plagued by labor shortages. The issue has put an enormous amount of pressure on frontline workers and managers. To ease the problem operators are turning to technology.

Adam Birnbaum GP Bullhound

“So much of what’s been going on in restaurant technology has been on the front end” says Adam Birnbaum an executive director at GP Bullhound a technology advisory and investment firm. “How do we get something delivered? How do we change the menu faster? How do we get insights into what people have been ordering? I think the fact that we’re going into the backend of the house more is really interesting and I think the holy grail is addressing labor.”

One company came up with an interesting way to help restaurants find employees by using remote workers. Whoever thought this was possible in a business where in-person service is essential?

Bite Ninja offers a virtual workforce to restaurants so they can staff their drive-thrus and front counters. The “ninjas” work from a remote location and appear onscreen to customers at menu boards.

Bite Ninja was founded one night when co-founder Will Clem decided to use his laptop to take orders for his restaurant from home and nobody noticed he wasn’t actually in the kitchen. Clem was able to scale the idea and eventually turned to M&A to grow. The company acquired Zenu earlier in 2022. Zenu provides software to restaurants such as digital menus online ordering and mobile payments.

“I think the conventional way of getting people to work in restaurants if current trends continue is going to be a major issue for people to address” Birnbaum adds. “I think there’s going to be an emphasis on ways to make the labor pool more efficient or look for replacements.”

All About the Customer

“The customer-facing technology landscape for quick service and other high-volume multi-site restaurants is rapidly moving toward software that helps restaurants create more personalized experiences” Szyndlar says. “This may be through digital engagement point-of-sale integration or loyalty programs–anything that makes the customer experience feel more intimate and the customer feel valued and appreciated.”

Restaurant technology company Olo Inc. (NYSE: OLO) bought Wisely Inc. for $187 million in November 2021. Wiseley’s customer relationship software includes marketing automation table management waitlist and reservations and tracking guest reviews.

“Restaurant technology falls into two broad categories: software that will help bring more people into the restaurant and drive revenue which many refer to as front-office technology and software that will help increase profitability or back-office technology” adds Szyndlar. “We are seeing significant focus among restaurant chains and among investors on back-office profitability-related technologies.”

The restaurant sector is capital and time intensive. Any technology that allows operators to run their businesses more efficiently will produce greater cash flow making the industry poised for M&A.

“There are many options available to help restaurant companies increase sales and profitability. And for investors in restaurant technology there’s a significant opportunity for platform building as the best assets rise to the top of what remains a highly fragmented sector” Szyndlar says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2RpbmluZy91bmlvbi1ncm92ZS1mYXN0LWZvb2QtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1zZXRzLW5ldy1tYXJrLWZvci1nb29kLWthcm1hLTIzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1pbi1hL2FydGljbGVfNzcyOWQ4NGEtYjJmYS01MjNmLTgzNzgtZWJhNDYyZDQ1OTliLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union Grove fast-food restaurant sets new mark for good karma: 23 customers in a row 'pay it forward',"UNION GROVE — When it comes to paying it forward customers at a McDonald’s restaurant have joined together to take a giant leap onward.

Twenty-three customers in the restaurant’s drive-through lane took turns Thursday paying for the person next in line behind them — a new record-high number at the restaurant.

“It was kind of unreal” said employee Sharlene Wincek who was working the drive-through lane at the time.

The spontaneous gesture of goodwill toward strangers impressed the McDonald’s crew so much that Wincek posted it on Facebook congratulating Union Grove for the community’s generosity.

It also turned an average day at work into a memorable and heartwarming experience.

Restaurant manager Tyler Gaethke said he was amazed to see so many people reach into their pockets and connect with total strangers through mutual benevolence.

“Sometimes you have good days and bad days” Gaethke said. “But that was a great day.”

The concept of “pay it forward” — popularized by a 2000 movie with that name — involves random acts of kindness toward others typically by buying their coffee meal or groceries. It is often done anonymously so a recipient never knows who their secret donor was.

At the Union Grove McDonald’s restaurant 835 15th Avenue which serves about 900 customers a day employees usually see someone pay it forward in the drive-through lane about once a day.

A recipient has the option of grabbing their free lunch and leaving. But frequently when someone discovers that their meal has been paid for they continue the spirit of giving by anonymously paying for the person in line behind them. And so on.

The previous record-high streak at the restaurant was 15 people in a row.

Bob Wright of Burlington was No. 8 in the sequence Thursday. When Wincek told him that his Big Mac meal had been paid for Wright smiled and took care of the next customer.

Even though it ended up costing Wright a few dollars more than his own lunch would have cost he said it felt good to help someone else.

“It seemed like the right thing to do” he said. “Someone buys you lunch — why not?”

Wincek said she is always careful not to pressure people into continuing a pay-it-forward streak. She realizes that money is tight and that even just a few dollars can make a big difference for some families.

When Wincek watched one customer after another pay it forward until 23 had participated she was speechless.

Several of them paid more than what their own meal would have cost. But whether the next customer was getting a simple cup of coffee or lunch for a carload of people everyone just continued giving and giving.

“It was beautiful” Wincek said. “I feel like it’s the community coming together.”

The process sometimes slows things down in the restaurant’s drive-through lane as employees take a moment to explain to each customer what is happening.

But no one seems to mind the minor inconvenience.

Autumn Russell a shift manager at the restaurant said she has worked at other McDonald’s locations in the past. She has never seen so many people pay it forward as she does in Union Grove.

Russell said she will not complain about the line moving a little more slowly.

“People want to help each other out” she said. “It’s wonderful.”

Though doubts about the benefits of the “payvider” model certainly exist the success of recent payer-provider partnerships showcases the potential of these programs to improve the patient and provider experience. A study of Aetna’s integrated program for example found that plan members could realize significant savings for high-cost chronic conditions and experience fewer hospital admissions. A similar report from Cigna echoed these conclusions finding that integrated benefit plans resulted in increased patient engagement. Synthesizing data from payers and providers increases visibility into the patient giving healthcare professionals the context they need to improve health outcomes and streamline care.

The slow expansion of payvider networks is not out of a lack of interest in emulating programs like CVS Health/Aetna or Cigna. In fact according to a survey by the Healthcare Financial Management Association 60% of providers aim to follow suit and become payviders this year. However the same report shows that data and technology costs pose significant barriers to implementation.

The main benefit of this model is the ability to share population and individual information to create a more holistic view of a patient but if data is splintered across various networks neither partner will be able to capitalize on these opportunities. For payers and providers to access and analyze information from care coordination platforms pharmacy benefit reports and electronic health records they need interoperable and flexible data storage solutions.

Future-ready IT for growing organizations

The healthcare industry generates approximately 30% of the world’s data volume and data growth in this sector will continue to increase exponentially. Payviders need solutions that securely store all this data and also keep patient charts notes images patient-generated data and other clinical information accessible and shareable. To provide this comprehensive care to their members payviders must first expand their network reach. Acquiring clinics and in some cases other plans allows them to grow their business and increase member satisfaction.

With acquisitions comes the challenge of managing disparate application sets and often separate infrastructures. To control costs payviders should consolidate infrastructure to support their different business units. When bringing on a new physician practice or plan data storage grows often in unpredictable ways. Traditional management methods often require organizations to rip and replace infrastructure that is not capable of supporting new workloads resulting in costly and time-consuming conversions. With patient data at risk conversions may cause interruptions in care and jeopardize the validity of clinical data.

A storage infrastructure model that allows these organizations to expand their footprint without conversions or downtime not only saves time and money but also puts the patient data first. Members demand real-time access to their EHR and Insurance information and downtime compromises their ability to manage their care. To effectively scale out their infrastructure support organizations must consolidate their data storage in a centralized always-on solution rather than in separate infrastructure locations. On-demand storage-as-a-service solutions are the key to managing massive amounts of data ensuring that the organization’s IT can grow alongside the company itself.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for next-gen analytics

Compiling and streamlining data is nearly useless without a method of analyzing the information to uncover actionable insights. Although traditional analytical models are useful for hypothesis-driven research organizations of the future need to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to find patterns in massive data sets. With visibility into the payer and provider side of healthcare delivery data teams can predict crisis events promote personalized care and determine patients at risk. AI systems can pinpoint population-level data to identify predictors of certain chronic conditions or analyze a patient’s records to better inform accurate diagnosing. Ultimately these technologies provide organizations with the information they need to provide better preventative care and reduce hospital and emergency department admissions.

Despite all of these benefits few organizations are using these artificial intelligence capabilities in a meaningful way. According to a Deloitte report 90% of healthcare professionals surveyed believe AI is important to their organization but many cannot capitalize on the technology because of siloed unintegrated data sets.

For healthcare organizations to maximize the potential of these next-gen analytical tools they need AI-ready storage solutions. Whether it’s on-premises or in the cloud much of the existing legacy infrastructure technology requires teams of data scientists to run analytics and transfer data to ML-supported platforms leading to significant delays. Implementing new AI-ready infrastructure can accelerate the speed to insight facilitating innovation and producing actionable modern analytics.

Expanding the functionality of healthcare IT

As the healthcare industry continues to undergo digital transformation investing in flexible multi-purpose IT across the entire organization will be paramount. Healthcare technologies no longer serve singular purposes. An EHR is not just a collection of visit summaries but a compilation of patient-generated data physician notes and clinical images that are integrated into a comprehensive view of a patient’s health. Telehealth platforms have expanded beyond video chats to include asynchronous care delivery voice analytics and automatic clinical note generation. Similar innovation exists in the data storage space helping organizations store protect and analyze the billions of gigabytes of information that are generated on patients.

For payviders particularly future-ready IT is a must. The benefits of closer payer-provider relationships are becoming clear as these newer organizations continue to expand and report patient outcomes and business performance data. The future of healthcare is always unpredictable so why should organizations invest in solutions that can’t adapt and grow with them? Every day data becomes more crucial to understanding patient populations and improving their treatment and coverage. With flexible AI and cloud-ready storage these organizations can ensure that their IT is prepared to support their evolution.

The district is considering selling Anderson High School. The proposed plan by Cincinnati design firm Elevar would essentially merge Anderson and Turpin into one school on the site of the current Turpin High School and Mercer Elementary School. The proposal calls for elementary school students to be moved to other schools throughout the district.

In a message sent to families in the district BOE president Linda Hausfeld said ""the administration team (is) diligently working to research and analyze every aspect of this option before it can be presented to the community and to the board of education.""

She also reiterated that no decisions have been made nor will be made prior to hearing staff and community feedback.

Hausfeld claims that ""the primary focus during this process will be to provide students with the best education opportunities possible for both now and into the future.

Several community members said the Board of Education is not being transparent.

“The board and the directors have made no effort whatsoever to be more transparent with our community to this date"" said Kristen Kalonick a board member for Advocate FSHD. ""So what we’re really asking for them to come forward be open and transparent with the plan. If this is really truly an innovative solution that will solve our funding issues then why not share it with the public? Why not be open?""

The school district did send a letter to parents on Sept. 23.

""The district is currently analyzing and reviewing a concept to reimagine the configuration of our school district"" said Superintendent Larry Hook.

The current school board cited financial problems caused by the previous school board as the reason behind the proposal to consolidate the schools. Advocate FHSD said they are concerned that discussions with developers have moved beyond ""simply listening.""

""The public deserves to know. The community deserves to have the opportunity to ask the questions that they want to see asked and answered ultimately unfortunately that’s not the way this has been handled and I think it’s really fomented distrust in the community"" Kalonick said.

According to Hausfeld the superintendent and the district treasurer will have a detailed presentation on the financial state of the district at the next BOE meeting on October 19 however there isn't a whole lot of discussion planned regarding the consolidation proposal.

""I do not expect the administration to present specific information regarding the option to unify high schools at the October meeting as they are still researching and analyzing the details"" Hausfeld said. ""I fully expect more information to be shared with our school families and community once evaluations are completed.""

Both Turpin and Anderson have a combined student population of more than 2300 students.
