Mercedes-Benz activations show creative flair

Innovative and groundbreaking esports activations — including creating personalized championship rings for the reigning League of Legends world champions Edward Gaming and finding innovative ways to integrate its products into League of Legends’ intellectual properties — earned Mercedes-Benz the Arising Brand Award.

The German luxury car manufacturer’s journey to building organic brand awareness among esports fans began with its sponsorship of ESL One Hamburg 2017 and its interaction with the community watching the Dota 2 Major. “Mercedes-Benz partnering with us was the first time a nonendemic sponsor of its size activated its brand within an ESL tournament” said Kristina Müller former ESL head of strategic partnerships who oversaw the activation.

Mercedes-Benz Founded: 1886 HQ:Stuttgart Germany Key executives: Board of Management: Ola Källenius chairman; Jörg Burzer Renata Jungo Brüngger Sabine Kohleisen Markus SchäferBritta Seeger Hubertus Troska Harald Wilhelm Key esports projects/initiatives: Exclusive automotive partner of all global League of Legends events. Mercedes-EQ and Riot Games created the championship ring (left) for the Worlds trophy ceremony. Partnered with SK Gaming a leading esports organization and one of the world’s most recognized brands in competitive video gaming on Project Avarosa to promote diversity in esports.

Müller also recalled how impressed she was by a premium brand such as Mercedes-Benz taking the risk of venturing into esports and its intent to create value for the community over just grabbing eyeballs. “Mercedes-Benz demonstrated that it takes esports seriously and wanted to become a genuine member of the community by listening to community feedback as well as my suggestions and critiques.”

The Mercedes-Benz ESL One Hamburg sponsorship generated unprecedented social media engagement thanks to activations including sponsorship of broadcast segments team intros inspired by car commercials team-branded cars used by teams and displayed outside the arena throughout the event and the Mercedes-Benz MVP award. Alexei “Solo” Berezin who was selected by analyst and fan votes as the tournament MVP won a new E-class sedan.

Following the success of its first esports activation Mercedes-Benz sponsored some of the biggest esports clubs and tournaments before taking its engagement a step further. At the beginning of 2019 Mercedes-Benz acquired a 25% stake in German esports organization SK Gaming taking on the challenges of esports ownership alongside its equal SK Gaming co-owners Deutsche Telekom and German soccer club FC Cologne.

Beyond co-owning and sponsoring SK Gaming Mercedes-Benz maintained its partnership with ESL and added League of Legends creator Riot Games to its partnership portfolio. As the main sponsor of Riot Games’ major international League of Legends esports events such as the Mid-Season Invitational and the League of Legends World Championships Mercedes-Benz developed fresh ideas to engage the audience including animated car cameo appearances in the music video for the official Worlds anthem “Burn It All Down.”

Xset builds organization intentional about diversity

Xset’s founders had a vision for an elite organization that went beyond competition. For them it wasn’t just about excelling at esports but inviting those into the fold who might not have understood they were welcome too. In just over two years Xset has grown into a competitive esports juggernaut and an organization rich in diversity looking to disrupt the status quo. The inaugural Organization on The Rise Award winners — Xset and its founders Greg Selkoe Wil Eddins Clinton Sparks (right) and Marco Mereu — say that this is just the beginning.

The Boston-based organization which fields teams in esports such as Valorant Rocket League Splitgate and Rainbow Six: Siege also made a promise to grow and promote Valorant on the women’s side. In March — basically a week after making the vow — the organization announced it had signed a women’s Valorant roster.

Xset Founded: 2020 HQ: Boston Key executives: Greg Selkoe Clinton Sparks Wil Eddins Erin Ashley Simon Key esports projects/initiatives: Produced Drais Gaming Cabanas in Las Vegas Esports teams in Valorant Rainbow Six: Siege Rocket League Call of Duty: Warzone iRacing Splitgate Culture and entertainment efforts featuring: Ozuna Tee Grizzley Kyle Van Noy Swae Lee Fanga Nigel Sylvester Minna Stess Adrian Colbert Stephen Tomasin Anthony Alfredo. Diversity and inclusion: Partnered with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.

“We have established a brand that has certain values and I think we have walked the walk” said Selkoe CEO of Xset. “I think it’s had a big influence on gaming in general the way we’ve done things. We’re a young organization and to have the caliber of folks that have come in and invested and gotten behind us even in this tough climate has obviously been super-meaningful to us.”

Xset has found its way not only in competitive gaming but also in integrating a host of others into the operation. Xset invited Erin Ashley Simon a talented entertainment and gaming host who knows the industry into its ownership group. Simon who has been a co-host on the Bloomberg show “Cheddar” and featured on “Good Morning America” has been a gamer all her life. This makes Xset one of few esports organizations to have a woman of color in its ownership group.

“She’s a superstar. She’s not only great in front of the camera but she also has her hands on a ton of stuff in gaming and beyond gaming. She’s just so smart around business and strategy” said Selkoe.

Recently Xset added tattoo artist Joaquin Ganga (aka “Ganga”) who has tattooed the likes of LeBron James Drake Post Malone and many other celebrities and pro athletes to its partnership ranks. They will create gaming spaces in Ganga’s tattoo studios.

Xset also acquired Astoic Management a Black-owned talent agency with offices in Beverly Hills Calif. Both of the firm’s co-founders Lonnie Anthony (an SBJ New Voices Under 30 honoree in 2021) and Rob Martin have been appointed to executive roles at Xset.

And Xset isn’t done expanding.

“We have so many new models that we’ve created” Sparks said. “We have some culturally disruptive things to announce in the near future that we’ve been working on behind the scenes. Once we unload those not only is it going to be a significant increase in awareness of our brand but it’s going to open the doors and really change the game for what gaming can be and what it means and how it can grow all the opportunities that can come with it.”

‘Arcane’ earns high praise for taking esports mainstream

Riot Games’ recent history of rich storytelling of League of Legends extended to Netflix with the 2021 release of “Arcane” the critically acclaimed story of sisters Vi and Jinx (two characters from the game). The series is also Sports Business Journal’s Esports Rising Above Award winner for its efforts in bringing the League of Legends intellectual property to a wider audience and doing it in a way that’s garnered critical and mainstream praise.

'Arcane' Founded: 2021 HQ: Los Angeles Key executives: John Needham president esports; Shauna Spenley global president of entertainment; Whalen Rozelle COO esports “Arcane” was Riot’s first animated series set in the IP of the League of Legends game. It was integrated into the 2021 League of Legends World Championship. “Arcane” dropped on Netflix several hours after the conclusion of Worlds last year. The show was distributed by Netflix and held the No. 1 global spot for three weeks in a row also hitting the top 10 in over 87 countries. Season 1 maintains a rare 100% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and won nine Annie Awards (honoring the best in animation) including Best TV/Media General Audience Best Character Design and Best Writing making it the most-nominated and awarded TV show of 2022. “Enemy” the hit single by Imagine Dragons from the show’s original soundtrack has reached over 2 billion streams and went to No. 1 on the Billboard U.S. radio chart in May. ”Arcane” also recently won three Creative Emmy Awards.

The strong connection between the sisters and the story it fleshed out wowed not just League of Legends fans but mainstream critics as well. The series was nominated for five Emmys receiving favorable comparisons to HBO’s “Game of Thrones” for its character development. Netflix viewers embraced “Arcane” when it first debuted maintaining its momentum over the duration of its run. Its Rotten Tomatoes ratings are through the roof in every single aspect.

“Arcane wouldn’t exist without the overwhelming excitement and love and passion that players have” said Whalen Rozelle Riot COO of esports of the “love letter” for those invested in League of Legends. Riot’s most recent Worlds tournament for League of Legends featured “Arcane”-inspired imagery of lore-based towns Piltover and Zaun. Riot’s other esports offering Valorant featured an in-game bundle with a skin for the sheriff modeled after Jinx’s “Zap!” ability from League of Legends.

In the past media based on games have been underwhelming. Riot’s “Arcane” shows it’s possible to make the world of a video game emotionally compelling easy for those who have never played League of Legends to get into and fulfilling for longtime League fans. Arcane ticks every single box on the proverbial shoulder content for a competitive video game entertainment category.

HPE Evil Geniuses boost use of performance analytics

Evil Geniuses has long been at the forefront of innovation as befits one of the most recognized esports groups in North America and beyond. Looking to capture technological competitive advantages the Seattle-based organization has turned to advanced analytics and performance metrics while enlisting the aid of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cutting-edge technology to improve player performance. Evil Geniuses uses technology to benefit both players and fans making it the inaugural winner of the Esports Tech Innovations Award.

This past year saw EG embark down the road of technological innovation and partnerships related to player performance. Using HPE’s data analytics capabilities and artificial intelligence services bolsters EG’s proprietary player performance models. The partnership has been a boon to more than a few endeavors such as the new Factor platform.

Evil Geniuses Founded: 1999 HQ: Seattle Key executives: Nicole LaPointe Jameson CEO; Chris DeAppolonio chief innovation officer; Jessica Hammond chief culture officer; John Jung VP of operations and studio; Leonard Edwards VP and head of global partnerships Key esports projects/initiatives in technology and data and analytics: Pioneered the use of data and analytics in esports to build a championship winning LCS team using EG’s proprietary technology and data science team to discover new talent in the North American League of Legends scene; created leading talent development programs for Evil Geniuses League of Legends teams; and elevated strategy development for upcoming matches through automated insights that streamline the research for teams allowing coaches more time to focus on the players. Signed a multiyear partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the goal of bringing real-time data-driven insights to esports through AI and machine learning. Launched Factor.gg a free-to-use esports analytics platform that provides in-depth statistical information for performance analysis of professional League of Legends.

Factor launched last year by EG provides advanced statistics for professional League of Legends players that allows all players to learn from its information.

“With Factor we’re responding to fan interest in advanced stats and esports analysis and driving a change in how this complex data is accessed and analyzed” said Chris DeAppolonio EG chief innovation officer. “Our hope is that Factor sparks further analytical discovery of what defines top talent across competitive League.”

This year EG has taken its analytical skills to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in the launch of Blueprint its proprietary data analysis system. The system enables the organization to help arrange its rosters to fit each tournament it plays in. In order to best use the Blueprint system EG has deployed a 15-person roster split up into three teams a first in the CS:GO scene.

“We look at how we've integrated data into everything we do at EG as it relates to gaming and esports which is a natural extension for us that started with League of Legends where our team was able to build out not only scouting metrics and rubrics to identify talent and score talent and figure out who to bring onto our amateur and academy rosters but also to help identify when players are ready to move up” said DeAppolonio.

Developed by Danny Engels EG director of gaming excellence the system gives the organization’s CS:GO teams information on to how to play against certain teams which maps are advantageous for them and more. And once again EG is planning to use some of this data for the scene at-large not just itself. The organization wants to help grow the game in North America for both pros and players at home.

Valorant’s Game Changers expands opportunities

Valorant’s launch has turned the first-person shooter world on its head. The Counter-Strike-adjacent game has emerged as a real competitor to shooters over the course of its 2½ years. One of its crowning achievements has been the Game Changers initiative winner of Sports Business Journal’s Esports Rising Diversity and Inclusion Award.

Formed in February 2021 Game Changers is a parallel competition in the Valorant Champions Tour format that created unique opportunities for women and other marginalized genders within the Valorant ecosystem. If team participation is any indication Game Changers is a rousing success so far: Cloud9 Evil Geniuses Shopify Rebellion and more have bought in.

Valorant Game Changers Founded: 2021 HQ: Los Angeles Key executives: John Needham president esports; Whalen Rozelle COO esports; Anna Donlon senior vice president and studio head Key esports projects/initiatives: Game Changers supplements the competitive Valorant season by creating opportunities and exposure for women within Valorant Esports. It aims to cultivate a competitive women’s scene and highlight aspiring Tier 1 and Tier 2 professionals. Additionally Game Changers Academy supports grassroots competition and improvement opportunities for Tier 3 and amateur players. With its launch in North America Brazil Latin America Southeast Asia and Europe in 2021 Game Changers hosted more than 25 regional tournaments and supported more than 300 players around the globe. In 2022 Riot Games is elevating Game Changers by bringing together regional competition into a final global tournament in November.

Whalen Rozelle Riot Games’ COO of esports is proud of what Game Changers has accomplished and acknowledges that there’s a long way to go. “Game Changers came about due to a bunch of really passionate individuals who took up that [diversity] rallying cry and we sort of challenged ourselves” Rozelle said. Esports has the capability to have a truly neutral playing field he said and Game Changers is a way to break down societal barriers that are placed in front of women in the esports industry and globally.

The spirit of Game Changers exists across Valorant Rozelle said. One of the pillars of the program is not relegating Riot’s diversity efforts to just esports teams — but rather to give women and other marginalized genders platforms as casters observers administrators and various other job titles.

While Game Changers is separate from the main VCT competition Riot will integrate Game Changers more deeply with the organizations that are fielding rosters. Specifically Rozelle said he’s proud of the time devoted to listening to what women from individual regions need as Game Changers. “[That time] was well worth it” he said. “It’s serving the needs and meeting the needs of the women in each region.”

The future of Game Changers will continue to be decided by the women who are taking part. Rozelle said that any iteration of Game Changers will be informed by feedback and take the perspectives of the marginalized people it serves into account.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5aG9zdG5ld3MuY29tL3RvcC0xMC1oeXBlcmNvbnZlcmdlZC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS1oY2ktc29mdHdhcmUtdmVuZG9yc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) software vendors,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dailyhostnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /top-10-hyperconverged-infrastructure-hci-software-vendors (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711085090>, 'Connection to www.dailyhostnews.com timed out.

With the signing of Waldorf Astoria Xi’an Waldorf Astoria Shanghai Qiantan Waldorf Astoria Kuala Lumpur Waldorf Astoria Sydney Conrad Nagoya and an LXR Hotels & Resorts property in Bali Hilton’s pipeline of luxury hotels in the region increases to 20. When these hotels open in the coming years travellers will enjoy an exquisite portfolio of more than 50 luxury hotels across Asia Pacific.

With a growing middle class increased consumer spending and an underserved lodging market Asia Pacific presents a US$10 trillion consumption growth opportunity over the next decade.

Alan Watts president Asia Pacific Hilton said “Hilton is Asia Pacific’s fastest growing hospitality company and that signals the confidence that owners and developers have in our ability to capture growing demand and deliver strong returns in APAC’s most sought-after destinations. We share the optimism that owners and developers have about the future of luxury travel and appreciate the importance they place on partners and brands that will optimize their yield. As we continue to pursue quality organic growth and enhance our network effect we too stay focused on prioritizing the right partnerships to deploy the right brands in the right locations.”

Post-pandemic recovery has prompted increasing owner and developer interest in hospitality real estate as the APAC hotel investment volume in 2021 grew 46% year-on-year to exceed US$12 billion and investors focused on acquiring luxury or resort assets. The luxury travel segment is also expected to burgeon as 42% of APAC consumers who intend to take an international trip seek out luxury experiences.

“These signings mark an incredible moment for our luxury brand portfolio as we expand Waldorf Astoria Conrad and LXR throughout five countries in the region offering even more opportunities for travelers to immerse in our authentic approach” said Dino Michael senior vice president & global category head Luxury Brands Hilton. “From Waldorf Astoria’s intuitive service to Conrad’s bold design and LXR’s culturally immersive experiences the hotels continue to showcase innovation and deliver on what guests are looking for in their stay. This expansion reinforces the appeal of the brands globally and is a true testament to the team members who bring luxury to life.”

Hilton’s latest signings mark a further closing of key city gaps as its award-winning luxury brands debut or expand in key travel destinations such as Japan Australia Malaysia Indonesia and China.

China in particular holds great potential in shaping the future of luxury travel as it is home to the world’s largest consumer economy and is set to become the largest luxury goods market by 2025. Travel demand is also shifting as the country’s new generation of young and discerning travelers seeks higher levels of personalization wellbeing sustainability and quality in their luxury travel experience.

The signings of Waldorf Astoria in Xi’an and Shanghai Qiantan put the brand on track to double its portfolio in China and offer its unrivalled luxury in eight world-class hotels. When open Waldorf Astoria Xi’an will be one of the tallest buildings in this ancient capital of the 13 Dynasties. Designed by the famed design firm Yabu Pushelberg the hotel will draw inspiration from the city’s rich millennia-old culture and integrate oriental elegance into modern design. Waldorf Astoria Shanghai Qiantan will mark the city’s second Waldorf Astoria hotel. Located in Shanghai’s brand-new CBD – the New Bund area – the hotel will boast panoramic views of the Huangpu River and immerse guests in the tranquility and glamour of China’s commercial capital.

Today there are more than a dozen Conrad hotels operating in China. When the other nine hotels in the country’s pipeline open – including Conrad Shenzhen and Conrad Chongqing next year – guests will be able to enjoy the discreet yet sophisticated luxury that the brand is known for in more than 20 destinations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDg0NjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Dubai Palm Jumeirah Opens on Palm West Beach,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDg0NjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167127FA410>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDg0NjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR0cndlZWtseS5jb20vc2l0ZS8yMDIyLzA5L2hpbHRvbi1vcGVucy1oaXJvc2hpbWEtaG90ZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton opens Hiroshima hotel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR0cndlZWtseS5jb20vc2l0ZS8yMDIyLzA5L2hpbHRvbi1vcGVucy1oaXJvc2hpbWEtaG90ZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167127F8A60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR0cndlZWtseS5jb20vc2l0ZS8yMDIyLzA5L2hpbHRvbi1vcGVucy1oaXJvc2hpbWEtaG90ZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcm9vbS1yYXRlcy1hbmQtY29zdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Resorts World Las Vegas: A Guide To Hotels Rooms & Costs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcm9vbS1yYXRlcy1hbmQtY29zdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

When she was on her period she'd experience very heavy bleeding. There was a pain in her abdomen. She was anemic.

""I didn't really know what it was"" Jones of Milwaukee said. ""I didn't think about it too much.""

Now 44 she was 37 at the time.

At her annual appointment with her OB/GYN she found out right away. Her uterine fibroids were growing.

There was one in particular that her doctor had noticed the year before. But at this visit the non-cancerous tumor was 10 centimeters larger. Too large to keep being ignored.

The doctor prescribed medications aimed at shrinking the fibroids. The medication stopped her body from producing the hormones that are thought to feed the growths essentially putting her body into temporary early menopause.

""It was horrible I had the sweats I gained probably 50 pounds"" she said. ""And this was right around the time I wanted to have a baby.""

She decided to take the medication and see if there would be any improvement over the subsequent three months. But the time passed with no shrinkage of the fibroid. Another three months still no change.

At that point her doctor had to stop giving her the medication. Her only options left were surgical. She could have a myomectomy in which doctors would cut out the fibroids and leave the rest of the uterus intact. Other options would have made her unable to have children like a hysterectomy in which the patient's entire uterus is removed.

Jones opted for the myomectomy.

Her recovery from the surgery was lengthy: She needed assistance walking and dressing herself for about three weeks. For about four months she was in pain.

She spent at least a month out of work unable to run her prominent Milwaukee-based fashion collection. Jones has shown her designs at Fashion Weeks in New York Los Angeles Paris and Milan and has even dressed celebrity clients for the Oscar and Emmy red carpets.

But the surgery worked and for a while Jones was in the clear.

Until about two years later when she felt the pressure building in her abdomen again.

Her old doctor had moved so Jones set up an appointment with Dr. Marie Forgie an OB/GYN at Aurora Sinai Medical Center. Forgie confirmed Jones' suspicions: Her fibroids were growing back.

""Little monsters in there"" Jones thought.

A less invasive less painful option

Jones was not only more aware of her fibroids the second time they started growing; she had also learned of a different potentially less painful way to treat them.

She first heard about new efforts to treat fibroids while watching the Real Housewives of Atlanta.

Many of the shows cast members have talked openly about their experiences dealing with uterine fibroids including Kandi Burrus and Cynthia Bailey. Bailey had her fibroids removed through a less-invasive procedure called uterine fibroid embolization. The procedure blocks the blood flow to the fibroid cutting off its supply of nutrients and causing it to shrink.

Jones mentioned the housewives to Forgie. Was there something less-invasive that she could try this time around?

It turned out the doctors at Aurora Sinai had a different but equally appealing treatment available. The hospital had actually become quite well-known for performing it.

The minimally-invasive surgery called radiofrequency ablation or (its trade name) Acessa uses radiofrequency energy and heat to shrink fibroids to the point where they are much smaller and can even be reabsorbed into the healthy uterine tissue that surrounds them.

""Even if the fibroid is still there it changes the consistency of the fibroid from something like a baseball to something like a marshmallow. It's a lot softer"" Forgie said. ""Then it's less likely to cause pressure on things like your bladder or other structures within your pelvis which then of course is less likely to cause you pain and discomfort.""

Instead of a large abdominal cut staples and a long recovery time doctors would only have to make a few small laparoscopic incisions to perform the surgery. In the year following the surgery the fibroids can continue to shrink even more Forgie said. Most patients go home the same day as the surgery and are back at work in three to five days.

In January of this year Jones told Forgie she was going to opt for the Acessa procedure. The fibroids were continuing to grow and the symptoms were getting worse.

In early April she got the surgery.

""I came out of surgery feeling the pressure gone"" she said. ""As soon as I woke up I was like 'Oh! They're gone!'""

She was sore for a couple days. After a week and a half the cuts were healed and Jones was back to her life.

Fibroids have a disproportionate impact on Black women

Fibroids are very common with some experts estimating 50% of people with uteruses will develop them at some point in their lives. Others estimate up to 70% or 80% of women will develop them at some point.

It's not known what causes fibroids. Doctors also don't know of concrete measures that can help prevent them.

The benign tumors appear during a person's childbearing years. For many people they shrink after the person enters into menopause according to the Cleveland Clinic. Fibroids are rarely cancerous. But they can cause many other problems for people who have them.

""Sometimes they're small and they don't really impact a person at all. But sometimes they can grow to be quite large and someone may not even know that they have them"" Forgie said. ""They may just be living with these really heavy or really painful periods. And so what I've seen often is that women will have these horrible periods and think that it's just normal.""

While people of all races and backgrounds develop fibroids the tumors are disproportionality common among Black women. A March 2014 research review in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology estimated more than 80% of African American women will have fibroids by the age of 50. The tumors are also known to be larger than average in Black women — more likely to cause symptoms like abdominal pain heavy menstrual bleeding and bloating — and they seem to appear at younger ages according to the Mayo Clinic.

More:Medical bias: From pain pills to COVID-19 racial discrimination in health care festers

Black women are also more likely than women of other racial backgrounds to be hospitalized because of their fibroids and more likely to have to get myomectomies the surgery Jones first had and hysterectomies because of them.

Recurring fibroids are the No. 1 reason for hysterectomies in the U.S. according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. According to data from Hologic the women's health-focused medical device company that owns Acessa of the 2.1 million women annually seeking treatment for fibroids roughly 240000 women every year choose to have a hysterectomy.

Increasingly however women are calling for more conservative treatments for these painful growths.

""I think that people deserve options"" Forgie said. ""And people are coming in expecting options as they should. So it's really nice to have another tool that can help treat their symptoms but also not take them out of their lives for quite as long.""

Aurora Sinai docs fight for change and fewer hysterectomies

As with any new medical treatment or technology there are some concerns with the Acessa procedure that still have to be worked out.

It is possible that the fibroids can come back. The only treatment where fibroids cannot grow back is the hysterectomy.

Forgie also noted that while women can become pregnant after getting the Acessa procedure and experts have seen that the surgery doesn't appear to impact pregnancies there is still not enough clinical data to support recommending the option to women who are considering future fertility.

The procedure is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is recognized by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as an evidence-based treatment for fibroids.

One of the biggest barriers to making the procedure more available to interested patients has been making sure that the procedure is covered by insurance said Tyler Roosa a territory manager for Hologic who focuses on southeast Wisconsin.

When Hologic acquired Acessa in 2020 some 20% of procedures were being approved for insurance coverage. Now that percentage is up to 65% Roosa said.

In particular Forgie and her colleagues at Aurora Sinai have worked to establish the hospital as a destination for the procedure. Aurora Sinai was the first hospital in the state to buy the technology so doctors can perform the procedure routinely.

OB/GYN's there have also fought to convince more insurers — public and private — to cover the treatment for their patients. In January the state Department of Health Services added coverage for the procedure to Medicaid and BadgerCare Plus members following the doctors' advocacy. Forgie said the hospital continues to work with insurers to help get the procedure covered even if it's not listed as covered to begin with.

Forgie said that she wants women to know that they don't have to just suffer through dealing with their fibroids.

""Women are notorious for just putting their health care aside and being caretakers for other people"" she said. ""I want people to know right away that they don't have to suffer and that their health is important.""

Today Jones is back to traveling the world running her fashion design business. Though dealing with her fibroids has delayed plans to grow her family she still hopes to do so.

She said she feels ""amazing"" and wants more women to advocate for the health care they need.

""Listen to your body"" she said. ""If you feel something that's wrong go get it checked.""

Symptoms and resources

For many people uterine fibroids do not cause symptoms. But in the cases where they do cause symptoms these are among the most common according to the Mayo Clinic:

Heavy menstrual bleeding

Menstrual periods lasting more than a week

Pelvic pressure or pain

Frequent urination

Difficulty emptying the bladder

The new outdoor space features trees plants flower boxes hummingbird feeders patriotic benches paths hand-painted murals and a shaded patio totaling $20000 in donated supplies. The project was inspired by VA staff and community partners who envisioned better views and more visitor-friendly spaces for Veterans in the palliative care unit. The functional tribute is designed to enhance mental and physical well-being.

During project construction VA nurses provided input to ensure the space was built with Veterans in mind. The area was refreshed to reduce stress increase patient satisfaction and promote health and healing. The landscape beautification aims to improve patients’ quality of life in mind body and spirit. The outdoor visitation area increases access for families and friends to safely see their loved ones in palliative care.

The VALLHS Community Living Center is a VA nursing home that’s designed to resemble ""home"" as much as possible. There are activities for Veterans of all ages and family-friendly places for visiting such as the new outdoor patio. Veterans may stay for a short time or sometimes for the rest of their life. Veterans receive nursing home level of care which includes skilled nursing and medical care plus help with activities of daily living. The mission of our CLC is to restore each Veteran to their highest level of well-being in a patient-centered healing environment.

VA Loma Linda is dedicated to providing an exceptional patient experience with the best medical care possible. We follow a whole health approach to support the mental health and well-being of every Veteran. If you’re interested in volunteering or coordinating a donation to support Veterans contact the Center for Development and Civic Engagement at 909-583-6011.

MWPVL International Inc. which tracks Amazon’s real-estate footprint estimates the company has either shuttered or killed plans to open 42 facilities totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space. The company has delayed opening an additional 21 locations totaling nearly 28 million square feet according to MWPVL. The e-commerce giant also has canceled a handful of European projects mostly in Spain the firm said.

Just this week Amazon warned officials in Maryland that it plans to close two delivery stations next month in Hanover and Essex near Baltimore that employ more than 300 people. The moves are a striking contrast with previous years when the world’s largest e-commerce company typically entered the fall rushing to open new facilities and hire thousands of workers to prepare for the holiday shopping season. Amazon continues to open facilities where it requires more space to meet customer demand.

“There remains some serious cutting to do before year-end — in North America and the rest of the world” said Marc Wulfraat MWPVL’s founder and president. “Having said this they continue to go live with new facilities this year at an astonishing pace.”

Maria Boschetti an Amazon spokesperson said it’s common for the company to explore multiple locations at once and make adjustments “based upon needs across the network.”

“We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers” she said in an emailed statement. “We have dozens of fulfillment centers sortation centers and delivery stations under construction and evolving around the world.”

The Maryland closings are part of an initiative to shift work to more modern buildings Amazon says. “We regularly look at how we can improve the experience for our employees partners drivers and customers and that includes upgrading our facilities” Boschetti said. “As part of that effort we’ll be closing our delivery stations in Hanover and Essex and offering all employees the opportunity to transfer to several different delivery stations close by.”

Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy has pledged to unwind part of a pandemic-era expansion that saddled Amazon with a surfeit of warehouse space and too many employees. The company has typically weaned its ranks of hourly workers by leaving vacant positions open slowing hiring and tightening disciplinary or productivity standards. But warehouse closings are also part of the mix and workers are bracing for more. During the second quarter Amazon’s workforce shrank by roughly 100000 jobs to 1.52 million the biggest quarter-to-quarter contraction in the company’s history.

The Seattle company has also been seeking to sub-lease at least 10 million square feet of warehouse space Bloomberg reported in May.

When homebound shoppers stampeded online during the pandemic Amazon responded by doubling the size of its logistics network over a two-year period a rapid buildout that exceeded that of rivals and partners like Walmart Inc. United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. For a time Amazon was opening a new warehouse somewhere in the U.S. roughly every 24 hours. Jassy told Bloomberg in June that the company had decided in early 2021 to build toward the high end of its forecasts for shopper demand erring on the side of having too much warehouse space rather than too little.

Wulfraat said that most of the closings announced this year are delivery stations smaller buildings that hand off already packaged items to drivers. Facilities that have been canceled include several planned fulfillment centers giant warehouses containing millions of items. MWPVL estimates that

Amazon operates more than 1200 logistics facilities large and small around the U.S.

More belt-tightening could complicate Amazon’s already fraught relations with organized labor. Earlier this year an upstart labor union started by a fired Amazon worker won a historic victory at a company warehouse in Staten Island New York. A federal labor official on Thursday rejected

Amazon’s bid to overturn the result. In August workers at an Amazon facility near Albany New York filed a petition to hold a union election there.

How much overcapacity Amazon needs to work through is hard to gauge and some analysts believe the extra space will come in handy during the Christmas holiday season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBtLXJldmlldy5jb20va3ltZXJhLWFwcG9pbnRzLW1hcmstbWNjbGFuYWhhbi1hcy1uZXctY2hpZWYtZmluYW5jaWFsLW9mZmljZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kymera appoints Mark McClanahan as new Chief Financial Officer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBtLXJldmlldy5jb20va3ltZXJhLWFwcG9pbnRzLW1hcmstbWNjbGFuYWhhbi1hcy1uZXctY2hpZWYtZmluYW5jaWFsLW9mZmljZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671101F340>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBtLXJldmlldy5jb20va3ltZXJhLWFwcG9pbnRzLW1hcmstbWNjbGFuYWhhbi1hcy1uZXctY2hpZWYtZmluYW5jaWFsLW9mZmljZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDkwNjAwNTAyNS9lbi9BbGRlci1GdWVscy1hbmQtRW52aXZhLVBhcnRuZXItdG8tRnVydGhlci1TY2FsZS1hbmQtQ29tbWVyY2lhbGl6ZS1TdXN0YWluYWJsZS1BdmlhdGlvbi1GdWVsLVN1cHBseS1DaGFpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alder Fuels and Enviva Partner to Further Scale and Commercialize Sustainable Aviation Fuel Supply Chains,"BETHESDA Md. & WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enviva Inc. (NYSE: EVA) the world’s leading producer of sustainably sourced woody biomass and Alder Fuels a clean tech developer and greencrude producer have signed a contract for the long-term large-scale supply of woody biomass from Enviva which sources low-value fiber such as forest byproducts like tree tops limbs and commercial thinnings to further commercialize the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Today’s agreement would make Enviva an exclusive supplier of up to 750000 metric tons per year of sustainably sourced woody biomass to Alder’s first Alder Greencrude (AGC) production facility soon to be under construction in the southeastern United States. The supply of sustainably sourced woody biomass feedstock by Enviva is expected to commence in 2024 which will meet rigorous sustainability criteria subject to independent third-party audits and certifications.

Backed by Honeywell UOP United Ventures AvFuel Boeing U.S. Defense Logistics Agency the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory AGC can be refined using existing infrastructure into low-carbon to carbon-negative SAF that matches petroleum-based equivalents on specification and performance.

Bryan Sherbacow Alder Fuels’ President & CEO commented “Decarbonization of our entire economy is driving massive demand for the next generation of sustainably sourced renewable fuels. The size of the market for our product is equal to the petroleum market it replaces. With AGC technology the challenge of meeting this demand is no longer industry willpower or commercial interest; it is having ready access to diverse highly accredited and sustainably produced sources of biomass. Today’s announcement brings us one step closer towards achieving that aim while benefiting the communities in which we operate.""

The announcement represents a major milestone in the rapid acceleration and scaling up of low-carbon transportation fuels with the potential to fundamentally change the future of flying and other modes of transport over time. In March 2021 major U.S. airlines committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 which was reinforced by an announcement in October 2021 by the world’s airlines and aviation community. Recognizing the scaling up of SAF is critical to meeting such aggressive climate goals the White House launched the “SAF Grand Challenge” with goals to have 3 billion gallons of SAF produced in the U.S. by 2030 and augmenting to 35 billion gallons by 2050. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law amplifies the U.S. commitment to SAF by providing tax credits for every gallon of SAF produced based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction percentages. Further the IRA extends and modifies the tax credit for the production of renewable energy from biomass and other technologies.

Europe is pursuing similar policy initiatives such as ReFuelEU with the European Parliament voting in support of draft rules to require SAF to account for at least 85 percent of European Union (EU) aviation fuel by 2050. Similarly the United Kingdom announced the introduction of a SAF mandate requiring at least 10 percent of jet fuel to be produced sustainably by 2030.

Major U.S. airlines have been seeking opportunities to collaborate with other industries to deliver commercial solutions to sustainable aviation at scale with such initiatives accelerating over the past two years as they individually and collectively committed to becoming carbon neutral. In fact United Airlines has already committed to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from Alder Fuels when produced to the airline’s requirements. United Airlines’ commitment represents purchasing more than twice as much SAF as the rest of the world’s airlines combined.

“Abundant sustainable biomass conversion to energy-dense drop-in liquid fuels is essential to accelerating the current global transition to a low-carbon economy” said Thomas Meth President of Enviva. “This joint effort between Enviva and Alder Fuels enables sourcing of sustainable wood fiber and industry-leading technology to deliver the feedstock flexibility and commercialization of SAF needed to achieve jet fuel decarbonization at scale.”

All woody biomass feedstock supplied by Enviva to Alder Fuels will continue to adhere to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive’s requirements as well as Enviva’s industry-leading Responsible Sourcing Policy. In addition Enviva and Alder Fuels have committed to collaborating to gain sustainability certification under the internationally renowned Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials standard. These guidelines and conditions are further supported by Enviva’s industry-leading Track & Trace® program that provides detailed verifiable and independently audited data about the sustainability of Enviva’s sourcing activities and the journey its feedstocks take from the forest tract to the production plant to customers around the globe.

About Alder Fuels

Thanksgiving dinner might cost a little more this year.

The price jump can be contributed to an avian-influenza outbreak devastating flocks in the previous months The Wall Street Journal reports.

The outbreak affected over 40 million birds including about six million turkeys. The influenza made its recent introduction in the spring and experts fear it’ll return in the coming months.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the outbreak is the second-deadliest on record.

Hormel Foods Corp. executives say that the outbreak has affected its supply chain and that production volume is expected to remain low through the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.

Due to increased prices Hormel’s quarterly profits increased by about $30 million from last year.

“Lower industrywide turkey supplies are expected to keep prices higher” said Jacinth Smiley Hormel’s chief financial officer.

Even with supply chain issues enough turkeys are expected to be in the stores for the holiday season according to The National Turkey Federation.

In 2015 the deadliest avian-influenza outbreak left about 50 million birds dead. Since then the USDA has developed more accurate virus detection mechanisms.

Beth Breeding of the National Turkey Federation said that while there were some issues with turkey availability in 2015 they were settled by the holiday season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raW10LmNvbS9uZXdzL2dhZ2UtZWxlbWVudGFyeS1zdHVkZW50cy1yZWFjdC10by1maXJzdC1kYXktYmFjay1hdC1ycHMvYXJ0aWNsZV8yNTAzOWZiNC0yZTIwLTExZWQtOTEzNy00ZjAyMTI4MmNkNzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gage Elementary students react to first day back at RPS,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Why it matters The Speed is one of the last Bentleys to use the company's W12 engine which in this application produces 626 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque. What's next Bentley is expecting the Speed to make up one-third of all US Flying Spur sales.

With 626 horsepower 664 pound-feet of torque a 0-to-60-mph time of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 207 mph the new Flying Spur Speed is the most powerful quickest and fastest model in the Bentley Flying Spur range. Making its debut Tuesday the new Flying Spur Speed also signals the end of an era for Bentley  as it will be one of the company's last models to use the iconic W12 engine.

The 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 is a key part of Bentley's Speed models. In the Flying Spur it offers a healthy increase of 84 hp and 96 lb-ft over the 4.0-liter V8 in the Flying Spur S. However as we've found with cars like the Bentley Continental GT and Bentayga SUV while the Speed is the master of power the V8 variants are often more engaging to drive.

Enlarge Image The Flying Spur Speed uses Dinamica Pure fabric throughout the interior. Bentley

On that note Bentley packs the Flying Spur Speed with a long list of standard equipment including the company's 48-volt Dynamic Ride anti-roll tech and four-wheel steering. The speed rides on 22-inch wheels that are unique to this model.

This being a Bentley the Flying Spur Speed's customization options are pretty much endless and this model comes standard with a dark-tinted grille. You can also add the Styling Specification which includes high-gloss carbon fiber on the front bumper splitter side skirts rear diffuser and trunk lid.

Inside there are Speed-specific color options and Bentley uses more Dinamica suede-like fabric here than in other models. Called Dinamica Pure this new textile is made from 73% recycled polyester. Of course a world of leather upholstery options are available as are various metal and open-pore wood trims.

The Speed will no doubt be the most expensive model in the Flying Spur range when it goes on sale not that this will be a problem for Bentley buyers. In fact Bentley is expecting the Speed to account for a third of all Flying Spur sales in the US. Go big or go home right?"

Nearly 300 rushing yards more than 5 yards per carry and a quarterback who was not sacked.

""When you give up no sacks and run the ball how you did it's a great day but the standard's high for our unit'' Schmitz the Gophers standout center said Tuesday of the team's season-opening 38-0 win over New Mexico State. ""We know we've got a lot to get better at and we will.''

Less than an hour earlier Gophers coach P.J. Fleck had a similar assessment of his offensive line.

""I think they can play better and if they sat right in front of you they'd say the same thing'' Fleck said during his KFXN-FM radio show. ""There's a lot of good things on film and there's some things we need to be able to clean up.''

In the Gophers' world comfort leads to complacency and the aim is to be better tomorrow than you were today. That next chance for improvement comes Saturday at Huntington Bank Stadium against Western Illinois another overmatched opponent that's expected to give the Gophers a chance to fine-tune their game before stiffer tests come later in the season.

Schmitz in his fourth season as a starter is the undisputed leader of an offensive line that has four new starters including a pair of transfers. He's charged to build chemistry and camaraderie along the line and he's been impressed with the professional nature of his teammates.

""There's guys that want to be there want to be with each other'' Schmitz said. ""That's what it's all about — the connectivity of the room. I'm definitely excited to continue to grow with these guys and see where it goes.''

That connectivity Fleck believes doesn't happen only when the Gophers are on the practice field or in the football facility. Rather offensive lines develop wherever they gather.

""One of the biggest things is hanging out away from the field'' Fleck said during his radio show. ""That group more than anybody has to be able to form an identity together not as individuals. To me it's about having camaraderie outside the football field.''

That's no problem for a ringleader like Schmitz a gregarious 320-pounder who ranks among the top centers in the country. Schmitz brings the substance to go along with the style needed for his role.

""As an offensive line you like to do little gatherings here and there. Of course you need some sort of food there so it's either a grill-out or pizza or something like that'' Schmitz said. ""Just hanging out watching some games or watching a couple movies or even if it's a bags tournament.''

The offensive linemen got to hang out together quite a bit on the field on Thursday with the Gophers keeping the ball for 44 minutes 30 seconds to New Mexico State's 15:30. That stat had Schmitz smiling again.

""We just love each and every play that we've got control of the ball and we're going to run it'' he said. ""Try and stop it basically. It's an offensive line's pride to truly dominate whoever's across from you. I wouldn't have it any other way.''",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlL2dvcGhlcnMtZGVmZW5zZS13YXMtcmVjb3JkLXNldHRpbmctZ29vZC12cy1uZXctbWV4aWNvLXN0YXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gophers defense was record-setting good vs. New Mexico State,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlL2dvcGhlcnMtZGVmZW5zZS13YXMtcmVjb3JkLXNldHRpbmctZ29vZC12cy1uZXctbWV4aWNvLXN0YXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712645D50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlL2dvcGhlcnMtZGVmZW5zZS13YXMtcmVjb3JkLXNldHRpbmctZ29vZC12cy1uZXctbWV4aWNvLXN0YXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

As clients turn to AWS Marketplace for many of their IT buying decisions they often have cloud commitments with AWS they want to put toward their purchases. At the same time organizations often rely on the help of resellers to help them integrate install and maintain their infrastructure. ​This important move providing wider availability of IBM’s SaaS technology suite will help better support IBM hybrid cloud and AI clients on their journeys and provide an additional opportunity for resellers.​

This new initiative demonstrates all parts of the IBM Ecosystem coming together — from hyperscalers to resellers technology vendors and more. The first phase in a multi-phased approach IBM and partners in the United States can now jointly meet clients where they are providing buyers with the benefits that come from reseller relationships as well as the budget and efficiency benefits of AWS Marketplace. This new program gives clients access to more than 50 IBM software solutions on AWS Marketplace with the opportunity to buy from authorized IBM Business Partners.

By enabling all types of partners to work together purchasing is easier and more flexible for clients. For the first time new opportunities are created for IBM Ecosystem partners while allowing clients to use AWS cloud credits — something clients and partners have been asking for.​

We’re excited to see how this will elevate and enrich the IBM Ecosystem partner experience and offering. To hear more about the program please reach out to your IBM sales representative or local partner for more information.

We founded Decision Focus initially as a reseller of the IBM Rational suite. IBM’s enthusiasm and willingness to help what was then a very small start-up succeed have been invaluable to our success.

In 2018 when IBM divested much of the Rational portfolio we decided to pivot our business model develop our own software services. IBM was more than simply a safe pair of hands when it came to building the Decision Focus platform it has been a partner at every stage in our journey with support from technology marketing and business development to programs like Champions for Growth.

IBM’s marketing team in particular played a critical role in bringing our solution to market. The Decision Focus website our inbound marketing online events and content portfolio were all kickstarted by IBM Co-Marketing and it continues to support us as we make the transition from online to face-to-face events.

Decision Focus’ portfolio of audit governance risk & compliance offerings are “code-free” modular solutions which come ready-made to handle the basic ERM requirements of most enterprises. The bespoke functionality which an individual client needs can be rapidly built and rolled out thanks to the no-code nature of our platform. There’s no complex training no lengthy onboarding process. It’s fast simple and intuitive.

“We migrated our Risk Management framework straight into the Decision Focus Risk Management system within one quarter. Decision Focus staff were professional super-fast and a trusted supplier who are dependable. We have been able to enhance aspects of our Risk Management Framework and continue to embed the system across the group.”

Catherine Palmer Risk MI Officer Hastings

IBM Cloud for Financial Services has the specific features for security compliance and resiliency that financial institutions require built-in so being on IBM Cloud for Decision Focus has opened the door to working with some of the largest financial services companies in the world. Just recently InsuranceERM awarded us ERM end-to-end solution of the year for 2022.

“Decision Focus is revolutionising how we go about risk management linking risks controls and incidents in a way that is simple to navigate visualise analyse and report.”

Eugene Owusu Head of Risk and Compliance Transformation and Chief Product Owner Liberty Specialty Markets

Decision Focus aims to be the first choice for Financial Services when it comes to audit risk and compliance. We are committed to bringing risk management for the risk averse. I would even go as far as to say we’re making risk and compliance exciting.

Michael Chappell to rule in favor of Latham client GRAIL and its acquirer Illumina – marking the first time the FTC’s administrative law judge has ever ruled against the FTC in a merger case. Based in California GRAIL is a healthcare company focused on saving lives and improving health by pioneering new technologies for early cancer detection.

Importantly the court’s decision not only cements precedent on the pro-competitive nature of vertical transactions such as Illumina/GRAIL but also enables the merged companies to speed the market introduction of GRAIL’s life-saving innovation Galleri a non-invasive multi-cancer diagnostic blood test that can detect cancer early for over 50 different cancer types and profoundly increase early detection of cancer when it is still treatable.

The transaction valued at more than US$8 billion was announced in September 2020. The FTC issued a Second Request in November 2020 and after filing and then withdrawing a formal challenge in US federal court the FTC then decided to pursue its claim before its internal administrative court. Despite the FTC’s attempts to block the deal and a similar challenge brought by the European Commission the EU’s antitrust authority the transaction closed in August 2021.

The Latham antitrust trial team that successfully defended GRAIL in the FTC administrative court included Washington D.C. partners Michael Egge and Maggy Sullivan and Bay Area partner Al Pfeiffer Washington D.C. counsel Anna Rathbun and Monica Groat and Washington D.C. associates David Johnson Sean Mulloy Zoë Hutchinson and San Diego associate Nathaniel Amann and Washington D.C. paralegals June Elliott and Stefanie Johnson. Representing GRAIL in the European Commission’s challenge are partners David Little in London/Brussels Javier Ruiz Calzado in Brussels; Adrien Giraud in Paris; and José María Jiménez-Laiglesia in Madrid; with associates Anna Escrigas Cañameras Daniel Muheme Jérôme de Ponsay and Simon Troch all in Brussels.

A broader Latham team also represented GRAIL in the transaction with an M&A deal team led by Los Angeles partner Alex Voxman and Century City partner Andrew Clark with assistance from Century City partner David Zaheer Los Angeles partner Brian Duff New York associate Eduard Grigoryan Los Angeles associate Tim Day and Bay Area associates Tess Bloom and Natalie Robertson. Advice was also provided on capital markets matters by San Diego partner Cheston Larson and Bay Area partner Brian Cuneo; on tax matters by New York partners Lisa Watts and Eric Kamerman; on employee benefits and compensation matters by Los Angeles partner Larry Seymour and Century City/Bay Area partner Julie Crisp with Los Angeles associate Jordan Barnes; on US merger clearance matters by Washington D.C. counsel Patrick English; on intellectual property matters by Bay Area/San Diego partner Christopher Hazuka with San Diego associate Robert Yeh; and on FDA regulatory matters by Washington D.C. partner Elizabeth Richards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvZXVyb3BlYW4tdW5pb24tYmxvY2tzLWlsbHVtaW5hcy15ZWFycy1sb25nLXF1ZXN0LWdyYWls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European Union blocks Illumina's years-long quest for Grail,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvZXVyb3BlYW4tdW5pb24tYmxvY2tzLWlsbHVtaW5hcy15ZWFycy1sb25nLXF1ZXN0LWdyYWls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712B8A950>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvZXVyb3BlYW4tdW5pb24tYmxvY2tzLWlsbHVtaW5hcy15ZWFycy1sb25nLXF1ZXN0LWdyYWls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNjb3ZlcnllZHVjYXRpb24uY29tL2RldGFpbHMvZGlzY292ZXJ5LWVkdWNhdGlvbi1hbmQtaWxsdW1pbmEtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1wcmVzZW50LWEtbmV3LXZpcnR1YWwtZmllbGQtdHJpcC1mb3Itc3R1ZGVudHMtdG8tZXhwbG9yZS10aGUtcG93ZXItb2YtZG5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discovery Education and Illumina Corporate Foundation Present a New Virtual Field Trip for Students to Explore the ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.discoveryeducation.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /details/discovery-education-and-illumina-foundation-present-a-new-virtual-field-trip-for-students-to-explore-the-power-of-dna/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712B8BAF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNjb3ZlcnllZHVjYXRpb24uY29tL2RldGFpbHMvZGlzY292ZXJ5LWVkdWNhdGlvbi1hbmQtaWxsdW1pbmEtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1wcmVzZW50LWEtbmV3LXZpcnR1YWwtZmllbGQtdHJpcC1mb3Itc3R1ZGVudHMtdG8tZXhwbG9yZS10aGUtcG93ZXItb2YtZG5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NkZXZpY2UuY29tL2lsbHVtaW5hLWFwcGVhbC1ldXJvcGVhbi1jb21taXNzaW9uLWJsb2NrLWdyYWlsLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European Commission blocks Illumina's Grail acquisition company to appeal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.massdevice.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /illumina-appeal-european-commission-block-grail-acquisition/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712B88A60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NkZXZpY2UuY29tL2lsbHVtaW5hLWFwcGVhbC1ldXJvcGVhbi1jb21taXNzaW9uLWJsb2NrLWdyYWlsLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Intel announced a new Software Advantage Program targeted at prebuilt systems and laptops equipped with the latest hardware.

Intel Arc Alchemist GPUs might not be here yet for desktops at least not everywhere and not in high-end format but the company is ready to give away some cool games and software with it.

From the promotion’s terms and conditions we learn that Intel will be giving away Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed Gotham Knights and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt. It is worth reminding our readers that some of these games were already announced to support Intel GPU features such as XeSS or ray tracing acceleration.

Furthermore Intel will also bundle some really good software such as Topaz Gigapixel AI and video/content creation tools such as PowerDirector 365 D5 Render MAGIX Video Pro X14 Topaz Gigapixel AI or XSplit Premium Suite. Participants will be allowed to select 3 out of 5 listed software products but all four games are included.

Eligible systems are defined by the discrete graphics and all A7 and A5 Arc GPUs are included even mobile. Since Intel did not release any A7/A5 desktop GPUs this offer is primarily for mobile users now. The promotion started on August 25th and will last until December 31st. Consumers will be allowed to claim their codes till of January.

“Freedom always has different manifestations but the most important of many is the ability to work for your benefit for the benefit of your children and the one of your country. In Ukraine we are fighting for everything that you have. We stand so that every Ukrainian would enjoy all the manifestations of freedom available to a free person in a democratic society” the Head of State said.

According to him Ukraine has achieved significant results in this struggle.

“We have united the whole world around our struggle for freedom. We’re liberating Ukraine’s territory from the Russian army. We have already started renovating everything that was destroyed by the Russian terror. We’re rebuilding our economy. We’re giving you and your companies the opportunity to work together with us – for the benefit of us all” the President noted.

As Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized Ukraine is the story of a future victory and a chance for business to invest in projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars right now to share the victory with our state.

“Today we kickstart a large-scale promotion campaign to attract investments #AdvantageUkraine. We will tell the world why Ukraine is a place for good investments and financial opportunities. I invite you to Ukraine! Invest in Ukraine! This will be your victory and a new success story for your companies. Glory to Ukraine! Start your work!” the Head of State urged.

Here Are 3 Other Ways to Get Your Credit Score,"Do you use Credit Karma to get your free credit score? Over 110 million members do. Credit Karma is an online credit service that provides actual credit scores pulled from two of the major consumer credit bureaus. What's the catch? Credit Karma allows you to monitor your credit information for free but receives compensation from third-party advertisers and when customers are approved for loans or credit cards through their site.

Unfortunately the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) just ordered the company to pay $3 million to their users. The FTC said that Credit Karma falsely claimed that consumers were ""pre-approved"" and had ""90% approval odds"" to get them to apply for a credit card. According to the FTC nearly one-third of people who applied for those offers were ultimately denied and that misrepresentation impacted their credit scores. Credit Karma said it disagrees with the FTC but is settling to avoid disruptions. While Credit Karma which is owned by Intuit  is one of the most popular free credit score sites here are three other ways you can get your score for free.

Credit score vs. credit report

Your credit score is one of the most important financial numbers in your life. Financial institutions use it to determine whether you qualify for a loan or a credit card as well as your interest rate. Your score can also determine how much you pay for your insurance premiums and many employers and landlords pull your credit as part of the screening process.

Your credit report on the other hand lists your bill payment history loans current debt and other financial information. It shows where you worked lived and whether you've been sued arrested or filed for bankruptcy.

Federal law gives you the right to get a free copy of your credit report every 12 months. Through Dec. 2022 everyone in the U.S. can get a free credit report each week from all three nationwide credit bureaus (Equifax Experian and TransUnion) at AnnualCreditReport.com. It is important to note that your credit report and credit score are two different things.

Free credit reports provided by the nationwide credit reporting agencies do not include credit scores. While you are entitled to a free credit report you are not entitled to a free credit score. To get your score you can buy it from one of the three major credit reporting agencies or other third-party companies that use one of the credit bureaus. Be careful of programs offering ""free scores"" if you enroll. They may offer a free trial period but they are generally not really free. Credit Karma was one of the first sites to offer a free credit score. Here are other sites where you can also get a free score.

Experian

Experian is one of the three major credit bureaus. Experian allows you to get your FICO Score for free. Checking your credit score is considered a soft inquiry and will not lower your credit scores. If you want your VantageScore a credit score that was developed by the three national credit bureaus you will have to pay $7.95.

Credit Sesame

Credit Sesame is a credit and loan company similar to Credit Karma. You can get your free credit score from TransUnion with a free Credit Sesame account. You can upgrade to a premium Credit Sesame plan for credit report and credit score info from all three bureaus. Like Credit Karma Credit Sesame earns a small fee from financial institutions but only after you close on a loan or credit card.

Your credit card company

Your credit card company may provide a free score. The following card issuers do:

In some cases you don't have to be a customer to enroll. You can sign up and receive your weekly TransUnion credit score reports from Capital One even if you don't have a Capital One card. Chase also gives you a free credit score with Chase Credit Journey. It's free for everyone and you don't have to have a Chase account. Chase Credit Journey uses VantageScore 3.0® by Experian. Contact your credit card companies to see if they offer a free credit score.

With so much at stake it is important to maintain a good credit score. Checking your credit score frequently will help you better understand your current financial situation. It can also help you detect any inaccurate information. These three ways to get your score are worth using to monitor your credit to ensure it is healthy!",,,,,,,,,

The Fed has raised interest rates 225 basis points this year and the market is bracing for another rate hike to come at the next Fed meeting at the end of September. Yet according to Invesco real estate has generally remained a top performer from a total return perspective during cycles of Fed tightening when compared with stock and bonds.

WMRE spoke with Bert Crouch Invesco Real Estate’s Head of North America and Portfolio Manager to hear more about Invesco’s outlook on challenges and opportunities in the commercial real estate investment market. Crouch is also the Lead Portfolio Manager for the closed-end opportunistic fund series Invesco Strategic Opportunities as well as a member of the firm’s North American and Asia-Pacific credit committees North American Investment Strategy group North American Management Committee and Global Executive Committee. With $92.0 billion of global real estate assets under management Invesco Real Estate is one of the largest real estate investment managers worldwide. The portfolio includes $50.6 billion in North America direct real estate $18.2 billion in listed real assets $15.0 billion in European direct real estate and $8.2 billion in Asia direct real estate.

This interview has been edited for style length and clarity.

WMRE: Rising interest rates have prompted a number of institutions to pause on acquisition strategies. What is Invesco’s position and how are you viewing the market?

Related: What Are the Safest Property Bets Today for Levered CRE Buyers?

Bert Crouch: This is probably the number one question we get today. It’s not just about capital flows but how does this affect our strategic direction and are we leaning in or leaning out? When you think about capital markets more generally whether it’s inflation pushing rates up interest rates and the volatility in resulting uncertainty from a macro-economic standpoint we have seen a significant drop off in the stock market. The majority of institutional capital providers’ portfolios at least half is publicly traded stock.

Traditional targeted allocations to commercial real estate that were hovering around 10 percent were effectively at 9 to 9.5 percent going into the year. The stock market dropping off reset allocations from a denominator effect from being under-allocated by 100 to 150 basis points to being over-allocated by 50 to 100 basis points. So being net neutral in making new investments or selling investments within commercial real estate happened almost overnight. From the end of the first quarter through the end of the second quarter we saw that denominator effect take hold and that is an immediate pullback by your CIO of a public or private pension although more the former than the latter.

WMRE: How are you seeing inflation and higher rates impact markets?

Bert Crouch: We’ve done a lot of work on inflation and the correlation to private real estate. The good news is that historically the correlation to values has been positive. It’s hovered around 0.4 or 0.5 over a long period of time. What people don’t talk a lot about is an elevated balance level of inflation. Where inflation is above 3 percent or in the current case north of 5 percent that correlation actually rises to 0.7 or above. In that sense real estate can be an inherent hedge.

What people don’t talk about on the negative side is that when rates go up especially with the increase that we’ve seen in the 10-year Treasury cap rates have to go up. The irony of that over a very long period of time is the correlation in interest rates to cap rates has been high. But what we’ve seen since the early 1990s is that six of the seven times when that’s happened meaning a quick jump in treasury rates cap rates have actually fallen. Said differently the better driver that we have found for cap rates and values in a period like this has really been around capital flows which goes back to my earlier point around the denominator effect and seeing those pull back.

The other area that is an issue is stating the obvious in financing costs. If you look at where SOFR has gone over the last 60 to 75 days highlighted by Chairman Powell’s speech (on Aug. 26) the market has really reset. The SOFR curve that was projected to be in the low 3s at the end of first quarter has jumped to 3.75 and more importantly it is projected to stay there for an extended period of time. Going out to the end of 2024 the Fed Futures Market is projecting SOFR at almost 3 percent whereas 60 to 75 days ago that was closer to 2.5 percent. Institutional investors like us underwrite to the forward curve and we look at today’s spreads. Those are both wider over an extended period of time. Fundamentals are still strong but flows have pulled back and that is in large part due to the denominator effect and the expectation of rising rates.

WMRE: So do you think the market is already baking in possible rate hikes ahead in the Fed’s September meeting?

Bert Crouch: It is 100 percent baking it in. The only question is whether the increase is 50 basis points or 75. The market is fairly split on that. Chairman Powell’s speech was clearly more hawkish and in our opinion the Fed intends to go above the net neutral rate for a longer period of time to make sure they stamp out inflation. I think the Fed wants to change investor perception that this is going to be a quick pivot back to rate cuts and more of a focus on inflation versus employment.

WMRE: Some market participants point to pricing uncertainty for the pause in transaction activity. Do you think that denominator effect could play a bigger role in holding back transaction activity in the second half?

Bert Crouch: I do. When people talk about capital they talk about it too generally. Let’s be oversimplistic and look at core and opportunistic capital. There is an ample amount of dry powder that has been raised over the last year to year and a half whether it is mega-funds or specialist funds that is not deployed. It is waiting to take advantage of some of the current market dislocations. That said the market is driven in large part by lower risk lower return capital. Usually that capital is more perpetual and open-ended vehicles and it is more sensitive to the denominator effect.

Simply put my expectation is that you will see a lot more of the high-return capital that has already been raised and not deployed that will be looking to exploit some of the inefficiencies of these dislocations that we’re seeing in the market. At the same time the core capital is the larger buyer and I don’t see them jumping back into the market because that capital has already been pulled out and/or is part of a redemption queue.

WMRE: How are elevated inflation and interest rates impacting the overall appetite for CRE?

Bert Crouch: Number one it depends on the sector. We talk about CRE too generally and the definition has expanded even more over the last three years. If you look at Nareit and the publicly-listed real estate market over half of it is what the private market would call “non-traditional” sectors. The sectors that are most attractive from a fundamentals standpoint are those that can quickly and efficiently adjust to periods of high inflation—those where you have shorter lease terms and/or the fundamentals are stronger. A great case in point today is self-storage. Just looking at pure fundamentals it has been incredibly hot for an extended period of time.

Single-family rentals are another area where we remain extremely bullish due to the affordability. Suddenly with mortgage rates jumping significantly over the last six months the affordability is about 30 percent cheaper to rent versus buy. On the negative side are cash-on-cash returns. Rewind to late last year and you could finance a single-family rental portfolio at 75 percent loan-to-value at 2+ percent. That cost has jumped up to 5+ percent. Due to the higher cost of leverage you’ve gone from a cash-on-cash in the low double digits to sub-5 percent. You can drop the cost of that financing but then you have to put in more equity. Either way it’s more or less accretive financing. We still like the fundamentals but your cash-on-cash is down and your total return is down. We have seen institutional investor purchases of single-family rentals drop from 28 percent to 20 percent quarter to quarter. So we have already seen that pullback especially in that middle market segment that is most sensitive to the financing costs and the resulting cash-on-cash yield.

WMRE: There has been a lot of capital targeting residential strategies. What is your outlook for that sector?

Bert Crouch: We continue to find multifamily to be favorable. Invesco North America has a portfolio of just under 40000 units. Of those 6000 are affordable. That is an area where we have found that we can partner with local municipalities in a public-private partnership where we are able to allocate up to half of the units for an affordable component tied to AMI in exchange for a tax abatement and/or agency-like financing. So it’s a win-win in an area where we can still harness the benefit of multifamily fundamentals but at the same time partner to affect a better outcome in what many believe is still an affordability crisis.

Build-to-rent is another offset of single-family rental that is often overlooked. It’s an area where new starts have come down fairly significantly quarter over quarter as costs have continued to rise. Similar to SFR we have tried to make some strategic vertically integrated pushes i.e. buying into platforms and buying into the actual operating company for areas of the market where we are strongly convicted that fundamentals are highly fragmented and highly specialized. We did that in single-family rental with Mynd and we also did with Avanta in build-to-rent. They are going out and providing an affordable solution of 200 to 300 units that are highly amenitized. We felt that buying into these platforms was more advantageous to us to allow us to scale and generate the highest quality product that we could.

WMRE: Are you interested in engaging in similar partnerships going forward?

Bert Crouch: We absolutely are. A good example is in affordable manufactured housing where we are in the process of launching with Homestead Communities. We’ve already made a handful of investments with this group. Again we are looking to provide an affordable option in areas where similar to build-to-rent where we are providing an amenitized community feel for a certain income bracket. Going back to my previous point for a large institution like us we need to scale and we need to do it quickly. We feel like when we scale we provide a better product because we are suiting the end user better. So it is important that we have that ownership interest and manufacturing housing is a good example.

WMRE: We’re seeing increased interest and more capital coming into CRE from retail investors. How do you think that capital could impact the market more broadly?

Bert Crouch: When you think about what’s happened over the last 20 years in the institutional space real estate went from a private equity portfolio to a sub-part of an alt portfolio. Over the last decade it became its own asset class and more recently it has its own classification. As that’s happened the allocation of your average institution has risen to low single digits to over 10 percent. The retail space is back where institutions were 10 to 20 years ago in the average allocation. Especially as you get below the high-net-worth to the traditional retail investor the percentage of their portfolio that is in commercial real estate is in the low single digits and the vast majority of that is in the public REITs.

So what we’re now trying to do is provide democratizing if you will that will allow the retail investor to invest like a high-net-worth individual and get that exposure to alternatives. Number one real estate provides needed diversification. Two there is an inherent inflation hedge if you are investing in the right asset classes with the right financing. Three what investors want in periods of high inflation is that they desperately want income. Four they want stability.

Now we see retail investors having the ability to come in with proper economics to create commercial real estate portfolios. So what does that mean going forward? Capital flows drive value just as much as fundamentals. I gave you the stats on that historical correlation. The caveat is the differentiation that I mentioned earlier. There is a sense of urgency for that capital to be deployed number one. And number two it is more income-focused than your traditional capital flows.

That also speaks to your earlier question about capital on the sidelines—the total return capital.

Retail capital is less focused on total return. It’s a component for sure but if you’re not meeting a minimum yield objective it’s not interested. To get that today with the higher cost of financing it has lessened the number of asset classes that qualify. Accordingly investors like us are gravitating towards those asset classes because that’s where we expect those retail flows to go.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnN0cmF0ZWd5LmNvbS9pbnZlc2Nvcy1hdDEtY29jby1ib25kLWV0Zi11bmRlcmdvZXMtY2hhbmdlcy0xMDMzOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Invesco's AT1 CoCo bond ETF undergoes changes,"Invesco has announced that the $1.2 billion Invesco AT1 Capital Bond UCITS ETF (AT1) the largest ETF to track the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) contingent convertible (CoCo) bond market has made changes to its investment approach.

Effective 31 August the fund is now linked to the iBoxx USD Contingent Convertible Liquid Developed Market AT1 (8% Issuer Cap) Index.

The new index is broadly similar to its predecessor in that it provides access to AT1 CoCo bonds issued by European banks.

Specifically the index focuses on the US dollar-denominated AT1 bond market the deepest and most liquid in which European banks issue AT1 bonds. The index covers over 80% of European banks by market cap including all of the largest issuers.

One of the main changes is that the index now incorporates a range of ESG exclusionary screens including removing violators of UN Global Compact principles as well as firms with operations linked to controversial weapons small arms tobacco cannabis predatory lending military contracting oil sands and thermal coal.

Additionally whereas the ETF’s previous index capped the largest five constituents at 8% and all other issuers at 5% the updated index extends the 8% cap to all constituents.

Following the updated index methodology the ETF is now classified as an Article 8 product under the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

The fund comes with an expense ratio of 0.39%.

A new chapter for AT1s?

According to Paul Syms Head of EMEA ETF Fixed Income Product Management at Invesco now may be a good time for investors to take another look at AT1s. Syms notes that the selloff in the first half of 2022 has driven yields across many fixed income asset classes to the highest levels seen in the last decade while fixed income markets appear to have stabilized mainly due to a gloomier economic outlook.

For the AT1 bond market yields have more than doubled from 3.1% in September last year to 8.1% today having peaked at 8.4% in mid-July. Spreads also appear to have stabilized at attractive levels.

Investors should note that the yields of AT1 bonds are not typically driven by the riskiness of the issuer as with other high-yield bonds but by a contingency element that triggers a conversion into cash or common equity if the issuer’s capital drops below a pre-set level. AT1s are intended to act as a buffer in extreme conditions and will have a lower credit rating and in turn higher coupon than the senior debt issued by the same issuer.

Yet according to Syms European banks have greatly improved their resilience over the decade following the Global Financial Crisis having reduced the size of their balance sheets improved the quality of assets held and increased capital held against risk-weighted assets. Banks now have plenty of capital in excess of their CET1 trigger levels and sufficient accumulated retained earnings minimizing risks around conversion and coupon suspension.

In short Syms highlights that the AT1 market is functioning as expected with bonds being called and refinanced even through the recent Covid pandemic and the current Russia/Ukraine crisis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzA1LzMtZXRmcy10aGF0LWFyZS1hbGwteW91LW5lZWQtZm9yLXJldGlyZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 ETFs That Are All You Need for Retirement,"These three ETFs will provide investors with diversification growth and balance in different market cycles.

There are literally thousands of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to investors covering broad swaths of the market and just about every sector industry investment style and category within it.

ETFs truly simplify the process of putting together a broadly diversified portfolio with just a few different ETFs. Here are three ETFs that give you all the diversification and growth you need for retirement.

1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF

The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI 0.59%) gives you pretty much all the diversification you need in one investment because this fund tracks the entire investable universe of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. It has more than 4000 holdings from the biggest mega caps to the smallest micro caps. But because it is market-cap weighted large caps make up the bulk of the portfolio.

The three largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and Amazon -- with the top 10 holdings making up about 24% of the portfolio.

Over the past five- and 10-year periods through July 31 it has an average annual return of 12.1% and 13.4% respectively. Year to date it is down about 17% as of Aug. 31. This ETF trails the S&P 500 slightly year to date and over the past five and 10 years but it beats the S&P 500 over the past 20-year period with an 8% average annual return as of Aug. 31. This better 20-year performance record is why I favor it over an S&P 500 index fund as a core investment. It also has a next-to-nothing 0.03% expense ratio.

2. Invesco QQQ ETF

With the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF as the core holding to anchor a portfolio the Invesco QQQ (QQQ 0.22%) fits nicely alongside it to generate long-term growth. This is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the world which stems from its excellent performance over the years.

Unlike the broadly diversified Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF the Invesco QQQ is focused on the Nasdaq 100 which includes the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. So roughly half of the stocks are from the information technology (IT) sector and about two-thirds are from IT and communication services. Apple Microsoft and Amazon are the top three holdings but they represent much more of the portfolio than in the Vanguard ETF as the top 10 holdings account for 52% of the portfolio.

This fund has been around since 1999 and has a stellar performance record. Over the past five- and 10-year periods through June 30 it has an average annual return of 16.1% and 17% respectively. Year to date as of Aug 31 it is down about 24%. But over the past 20 years through Aug. 31 it has an average annual return of 13.7%.

3. Invesco S&P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF

These two previously mentioned ETFs give you diversification and growth but they are both large-cap ETFs that will perform well in bull markets and track with the major indexes when the market is down. A third option for a diversified long-term portfolio is the Invesco S&P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF (RDIV 0.54%).

This ETF tracks the S&P 900 Dividend Revenue-Weighted Index which takes the 5% of stocks from the S&P 900 with the highest dividend yields and then from that 5% includes the top 5% in each sector with the lowest dividend payout ratio.

From those two screens it arrives at the 60 stocks with the highest yields and lowest payout ratios. This seeks to create a portfolio that consists of great dividends that are sustainable. But it also captures stocks of companies that are highly liquid and well capitalized even in the worst markets.

About three-quarters of the portfolio are large- and mid-cap value names so it offers a nice balance with the growth-oriented QQQ.

Lastly the holdings are weighted by revenue earned so that the companies that are growing the fastest at any given time have the highest weighting. Currently the top three holdings are Cardinal Health Valero Energy and Chevron.

This ETF has a 3.31% 12-month distribution rate which is the average yield over the previous 12 months. But beyond high dividend payouts it has solid total returns. As of July 31 it has a one-year return of 9.5% and a five-year annualized return of 9%. Since its inception in September 2013 it has averaged a 10.6% annual return. Year to date as of Aug. 31 it is basically flat with a 0% return but had been up 2.3% at the end of July.

These three ETFs should provide the type of growth diversification and balance you need to reach your retirement goals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZS1hcmNoaXZlL3RyYWNraW5nLXRoZS1pbXBhY3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tracking the impacts – pv magazine International,"The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) decreased by 0.9% while the S&P 500 increased by 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 2.6% in the month of August. The top five performing solar stocks in the US market include Sunworks (40.3%) Array Technologies (24.6%) SunPower Corp.(22.4%) Hannon Armstrong (16.6%). and First Solar (16.4%). With the industry digesting earnings season the Invesco Solar ETF was in slightly negative territory following mixed results among US companies.

During the week of Aug. 15 as it relates to ARRY & FTCI and the Inflation Reduction Act there is an $0.87/kg incentive for steel used in torque tubes which the torque tube manufacturer technically has a claim on.

Our recent checks suggest that in 2023 approximately 75% of this tracker incentive may go to the torque tube manufacturers given the limited number of suppliers currently in the US resulting in stronger bargaining power. That said many torque tube manufacturers are setting up shop in the US right now. By 2024 there should be a substantial number of suppliers which can tilt the balance toward buyers i.e. tracker companies.

With the Inflation Reduction Act now signed into law investors have been working through who in the value chain gets the tracker subsidy. Investors are trying to understand how the 10% domestic content investment tax credit adder may be applied and judged. Our checks suggest we’ll need to wait at least four to six months for the Internal Revenue Service to publish its guidelines.

During August prices for wafers cells and modules have stabilized amidst an end market standoff while polysilicon prices continue on an upward trend. Utilization rates in the polysilicon segment remain high while utilization rates in the wafer segment fell to approximately 68% those for tier 1 module manufacturers fell to 70% to 80% and those for SME module manufacturers dropped to 30% to 60%.

The smart thermostats market report offers a comprehensive analysis of the strategies adopted by vendors and the trends drivers and challenges affecting the market size. The increasing focus on integrated building management systems is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the smart thermostats market during the forecast period. Smart thermostats as a part of the HVAC system help in monitoring and controlling the temperature from remote locations and it turns on the other HVAC system parts to achieve the desired temperature. Consumers have become highly conscious of energy costs and the conservation of energy. Hence they prefer investing in technology that aids in reducing costs. Such factors are expected to increase the demand for smart thermostats which in turn will drive the growth of the market during the forecast period.

The high initial prices affecting the demand for smart thermostats is one of the factors hindering the smart thermostats market growth. Most of the thermostats offered by major vendors such as Nest Labs Honeywell International and ecobee Inc. are the do-it-yourself (DIY) type which poses a challenge to most consumers. Thus it leads to the need to hire professionals to install the thermostats thereby resulting in additional costs. Therefore the high initial cost of smart thermostats and the costs incurred in their installation discourage many consumers from opting for them.

A shooting. How Ely Walker went from chic lofts to 'public nuisance',"ST. LOUIS — When the elevators stopped working at the Ely Walker lofts back in mid-July it was just the latest inconvenience for residents of the downtown building.

Then the fire department arrived.

City building inspectors on July 12 slapped the Ely Walker Lofts condo board with a “major violation” for nonfunctioning elevators and an “inoperable or illegally shut down” fire alarm system according to documents obtained under an open records request. The city ordered a “fire watch” in the 174-unit building at 1520 Washington Avenue requiring employees to monitor the building until the alarm was working again.

“It has been beeping for years literally years” said Kristin Denbow who bought her unit back when the building opened in 2007. “Who knows how long our fire system has had issues that we are not aware of?”

Finally residents thought the alarm would be fixed. But the dull beep of the fire system began again in August. As recently as Thursday city officials were still waiting for confirmation that the fire alarm system had been restored to full capacity.

Questions about how long Ely Walker residents had been without a properly working fire system are only the latest to swirl around the building and the landlords who six years ago took over the condo board that controls spending on maintenance and security.

Just 15 years ago the 1907 Ely Walker building had been a St. Louis success story part of the revitalization of Washington Avenue that transformed the old warehouse district into chic lofts to draw people back downtown. When Ely Walker opened in the mid-2000s condos there were selling for around $300000.

But in recent years — according to court filings and interviews with residents and condo owners — maintenance has been deferred cleaning has been cut and the building has become tied to mayhem downtown.

Several residents and condo owners contend Sid Chakraverty and Victor Alston the brothers behind controversial apartment companies Asprient Properties and Lux Living are ultimately responsible for the Ely Walker’s maintenance and safety issues. An Alston company controls at least half of the building’s units and Chakraverty sits on a condo board made up of the company’s employees a friend and a family member.

Alston and Chakraverty own apartments across the region and have invested over $150 million into new apartment developments in the city. But they’ve also drawn complaints and lawsuits over their management practices for years.

St. Louis officials also have clashed with the brothers and their attorney particularly after a lawsuit they filed stalled a rival developer. Now as the city tries to rein in crime downtown they’re focusing on problems at Ely Walker after high-profile incidents including the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old in March in the building’s lobby.

In early August the Public Safety Department sent the Ely Walker Lofts Condominium Association a nuisance notice for “disturbances shootings and other unruly behavior.” A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday that could provide some relief to angry residents of the building — and perhaps to downtown as a whole — by forcing the condo board to spend money on security that residents say is sorely needed.

“It was a very very nice complex until Asprient took over” said Ted Saunders who bought a condo in 2011 as an investment property. “That’s the only property I’ve dropped my rent. ... Ever.”

Alston Chakraverty and their attorney Ira Berkowitz did not return requests for comment. Board president Anshul Sathyan — Alston and Chakraverty’s cousin — did not return a call nor did longtime Asprient and Lux employee Kyle Hennessy who is also on the board. The attorney who represents the condo association Elia Ellis also did not respond to a request for comment.

‘Maximize rents reduce costs’

In 2015 when Alston company Aconcagua One LLC bought half the units in the building from Mills Properties his family moved quickly to take over the Ely Walker Lofts Condominium Association.

They claimed the right to three board seats with Chakraverty and two company employees Hennessy and Connor Murch taking the other two board seats. In April 2016 they appointed another employee as a fourth board member of the five-member board.

Shortly thereafter the board called a special meeting for June 7 2016. On the agenda was a motion to move the condo association’s finances to another bank account and to remove the remaining independent director David Knolmayer as president and treasurer.

A struggle to keep Asprient from taking total control ensued. Some owners including Denbow and Knolmayer filed a lawsuit that is still pending. Denbow says they can’t get meeting notices or finances from the board which they are entitled to as owners.

“They violate state statute and condo law with impunity” she said.

Saunders a condo owner unrelated to the lawsuit had been unaware of the struggle for board control until a young man named George Chisolm sent him a text in the summer of 2017.

Chisolm said he was interested in buying Saunders’ unit. The two met but the deal went sideways after Chisolm said his “dad” wanted to review the contract and then pulled out according to emails from Saunders.

Saunders soon concluded Chisolm was a straw buyer. Chisolm other tenants said had contacted numerous owners in the building seeking to buy their units. The company Chisolm said would buy Saunders’ unit EWC Condo LLC was tied to Alston.

A few months before in March 2017 there had been a disputed election. An independent director may have won.

The Asprient-controlled board then hired a new lawyer Ellis who in August 2017 called for a new election. By then companies tied to Alston and Chakraverty or their associates had acquired several more units ensuring they had over 50% of the votes.

“What this means is that Asprient will have the majority of votes in every election or board matter that requires a vote” said an August 2017 email from the opposition which seemed to fizzle out after that.

Murch the former board member and Asprient employee was “uncomfortable” with the situation. He quit his job at the company in 2017 and resigned as a board member of the condo association.

“I was instructed by Sid and Vic on what to do at the board but when I had the opportunity I did try to do what was best for the board” he said during a 2018 deposition in the lawsuit from owners.

The tenants’ attorney Elkin Kistner asked Murch what his concerns were. Alston and Chakraverty Murch replied directed him and other board members to make decisions “for their better interest.”

“Maximize rents reduce costs” Murch said.

‘Why are bills going unpaid?’

Since Chakraverty and Alston took over rents have been increased those who lease say but condo dues which Alston would have to pay as an owner have not.

“Our (condo) fees have not been raised since 2015” when Alston and Chakraverty took over Denbow said. “Without an increase in fees logic dictates that services are cut.”

The Ely Walker Condominium Association collects about $500000 annually in condo fees according to financials.

Yet as city inspectors spent the summer pressing Sathyan the board president and Chakraverty to do something about the fire alarm system they discovered that part of the issue was an unpaid fire system vendor.

“I spoke with a representative of Siemens and was informed that they are not able to respond to your request for the fire alarm service until your organization first resolves its unpaid balance from previous services” city fire safety supervisor Joe Kovac wrote to Sathyan July 15 copying Chakraverty and other members of the board on the correspondence. “It seems that the all-too-frequent switch of management companies hired by your group’s controlling interest over these past few years has effectively been playing a shell game with honoring its debts; and all at the risk of the residents’ life safety. This is not the first time we have heard this reason for resolving alarm issues in your properties.”

The fire alarm monitoring company told Kovac that “they have been reporting monitoring problems to your organization since February.”

Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson put the issue on inspectors’ radar June 1. After Sathyan sent a January fire monitoring report to inspectors in mid June Kovac called it “practically useless” and said there was no proof deficiencies noted with the fire system had been remedied.

One inspector said then it was time to institute a fire watch.

“Sid Chakraverty says he is not responsible even though he owns 50% of the condominiums in the building and is a controlling member of the condo association” building inspector Michael Cardwell wrote June 16. “He tells me Smith Management is the management company.”

Almost on cue Sathyan emailed inspectors a half-hour later.

“The building is a condo building managed by a property management company Smith Management” he wrote. “The gentleman who was the property manager at the time did not convey this report to us nor did he follow through with the repairs to the system.”

As inspectors grew increasingly frustrated with promised repairs residents said Sathyan told them nothing was wrong with the fire alarm at all.

Smith Management ended its contract with the building at the end of July. St. Louis office president Angela Johnson in response to an email asking for an interview said the Ely Walker condo board was a former client and wished them well. But condo owner Grace Malnar recorded a July 15 phone conversation she had with Johnson about the issues at the building.

“We’ve been on this fire panel thing for a while” Johnson told Malnar in the recording. “We’ve given them bids and done all the things we’re supposed to do but they wouldn’t approve it.”

Sathyan “got mad” Johnson said and asked Smith Management to stop saying something was wrong with the fire panel.

“He probably doesn’t want it in writing” Johnson said. “But there is something wrong with the fire panel.”

The final straw for Smith Management was after media reports about the parties and violence in the building Johnson said. The company had proposed full-time security and cameras providing the condo board with bids for security.

“We were being blamed on the news for a lot of this stuff” Johnson told Malnar. “We actually heard they were using us as a scapegoat. And my company is a very large company and that’s their liability. So either they have an on-site manager and full-time security to protect our manager or we can’t manage them because it’s not safe.”

As of June the condo board had about $238000 in reserves according to financials provided by Malnar who was able to get a copy from Johnson.

“If we have the money why are bills going unpaid?” Denbow asked. “And two if they’re going unpaid then do we really have the money?”

Wherever it comes from Alston and Chakraverty may have to spend some money on the property if the city gets its way after Wednesday’s nuisance hearing. Public Safety Director Dan Isom said last week the city isn’t looking to condemn any units with law-abiding tenants. But it does want increased security and to get the owners who control the condo board “to take some personal responsibility and accountability.”

“Our end game” Isom said “is basically to have a peaceful location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvcHJvcGVydHktaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtcHJvamVjdHMtaW4tc2F1ZGktdG9wLTExdHJsbi1zaW5jZS12aXNpb24tMjAzMC1sYXVuY2gtb242cHE2OXnSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuemF3eWEuY29tL2VuL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3Byb3BlcnR5LWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLXByb2plY3RzLWluLXNhdWRpLXRvcC0xMXRybG4tc2luY2UtdmlzaW9uLTIwMzAtbGF1bmNoLW9uNnBxNjl5P2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Property infrastructure projects in Saudi top $1.1trln since Vision 2030 launch,"More than $1 trillion worth of projects have been rolled out in Saudi Arabia since the launch of the Vision 2030 strategy which seeks to transform the kingdom into an economic powerhouse according to a new analysis.

The projects include stand-alone super-cities such as NEOM which will feature 300000 new homes for nine million residents according to Knight Frank on Tuesday.

The global real estate consultancy is currently tracking 15 giga projects that are in various phases of construction around the kingdom.

It estimated that the total value of real estate and infrastructure projects since the launch of Saudi Arabia's transformatio plan has already crossed $1.1 trillion.

""The phenomenal transformation taking place in the world's fastest growing economy is clearly visible across the entire urban landscape... The planned construction in the kingdom will easily make Saudi Arabia the largest construction site the world has ever known"" said Faisal Durrani Partner - Head of Middle East Research.

As part of Saudi's massive transformation plan the kingdom is expected to deliver more than 555000 homes 275000 hotel rooms in excess of 4.3 million square metres of retail space and more than 6.1 million square metres of new office space by 2030.

Among the projects announced to date NEOM is considered the largest. NEOM will have sub-cities like Oxagon Trojena and The Line.

According to Knight Frank about a third of homeowners in Saudi Arabia are prepared to spend upwards of $800000 on a second home in the kingdom so developments like the sub-cities in NEOM should satisfy this pent-up demand.

However Knight Frank said only $7.5 billion of sub-projects have been commissioned so far with construction progress standing at 29%.

Another colossal undertaking is the $20 billion Diriyah Gate in Riyadh which will add 20000 homes to Saudi's residential stock by 2027. Nearly half (46%) of construction has been completed on the $5 billion spent so far according to Knight Frank.

Over the last six years around $104 billion worth of real estate projects have been unveiled in Riyadh. Population in the city is expected to grow to 17 million by 2030 up from around 7.5 million today.

The two pilot programs will begin next year under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Project REACh or Roundtable for Economic Access and Change. One program “will issue credit cards to people without credit scores while the other will make it easier for small businesses owned by minorities women and veterans to get credit.”

Citigroup is joining other banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp who are already working with Project REACh to release their bank-account data to help approve more borrowers for credit cards. According to the report 50 million Americans lack traditional credit scores which is the measuring stick that banks use to review credit applications.

Gonzalo Luchetti who heads Citigroup’s U.S. consumer-banking operations believes that the initiative will grant access to potential clients with credit issues into the financial markets.

“We’ve been looking at how we can lower barriers for entrance into financial services” Luchetti said.

Although the program is in its earlier stages bankers stated that loans issued through Project REACh are performing just as well as those given outside the program and the number of loans will increase in the coming year.

“We’ve done a lot of push-ups to advance this effort” said Mark Brucker the chief risk officer in JPMorgan’s consumer bank. “You’re seeing other banks see the benefit of those push-ups and want to get involved.”

Citigroup also announced another program to be established in 20 branches in Los Angeles ”to funnel more loans to small businesses owned by women minorities and veterans.” The bank will lower its previous thresholds for acceptable credit scores and other underwriting standards.

Several financial institutions are adopting new lending practices to help more borrowers access financial products. Last week Bank of America announced a program to offer zero down payment mortgages as well as zero closing costs for residents in select cities to combat the racial wealth gap.

The bank said the program called the Community Affordable Loan Solution “aims to help eligible individuals and families obtain an affordable loan to purchase a home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS90cmlhbmdsZS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvZmlyc3QtY2l0aXplbnMtbWFrZXMtbWlkZGxlLW1hcmtldC1iYW5raW5nLXBsYXkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Citizens squares off against JPMorgan TD Bank for prime market - Triangle Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2022/09/06/first-citizens-makes-middle-market-banking-play.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS90cmlhbmdsZS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvZmlyc3QtY2l0aXplbnMtbWFrZXMtbWlkZGxlLW1hcmtldC1iYW5raW5nLXBsYXkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

KDP has been gaining from solid portfolio demand and strong market share gains. A recovery in the supply chain of coffee and non-carbonated beverages as well as robust pricing actions also bodes well.



This led to the solid second-quarter 2022 results wherein the bottom line was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate whereas sales surpassed the same. Adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share grew 2.6% year over year.



Net sales of $3554 million jumped 13.2% from the year-ago quarter’s level and 13.5% on a constant-currency basis (cc). The upside was driven by growth in the Packaged Beverages Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages segments as well as higher volumes and better pricing.



Consequently shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 3.9% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.

Speaking of the Packaged Beverages segment it reported sales growth of 12.8% in the second quarter gaining from a favorable volume/mix of 1.9% and a higher net price realization of 11%. The segment benefited from growth in CSDs CORE Hydration Snapple Polar seltzers Vita Coco Mott's and Hawaiian Punch.



Also the company witnessed a strong in-market performance in the second quarter. As a result retail dollar consumption increased 9.9% and a market share expansion rose above 92% of KDP's cold beverage portfolio. This mainly reflected strength in CSDs3 premium unflavored water coconut water seltzers teas apple juice vegetable juice and fruit drinks. Also strength in Dr Pepper Sunkist Canada Dry A&W and Squirt CSDs CORE Hydration Vita Coco Polar seltzers Snapple Hawaiian Punch and Mott's aided the results.



In coffee retail dollar consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by Keurig Dr Pepper rose 3.8% in channels tracked by Iri driven by improved pricing in partner and KDP-owned and licensed brands. KDP’s coffee systems’ sales increased 9% owing to the company’s completion of the coffee recovery program.



Driven by these factors management raised its sales view for 2022. It expects net sales (cc) to grow in the low-double-digit range compared with the earlier stated increase in the high-single digits. Adjusted earnings per share are envisioned to grow in the mid-single digits for 2022. Adjusted earnings per share growth are expected to be in the high-single digits for the second half of 2022.



Despite the upsides all is not rosy for Keurig Dr Pepper as it continues to reel under significant input cost inflation rising transportation costs and supply-chain disruptions which are likely to persist in the near term. These along with the adverse impacts of higher marketing investment acted as deterrents.



Also higher transportation warehousing and retail labor costs dented margins in the second quarter. The adjusted gross margin contracted 180 basis points (bps) to 54.7% whereas the adjusted operating margin contracted 330 bps to 23.4% in the said quarter. Going ahead management expects inflation to remain the greatest challenge.

Story

Dan Taylor Technology Editor Military Embedded Systems

U.S. Navy photo. Radar and electronic warfare (EW) are challenging applications for designers of test systems. The only constant seems to be change in technologies tactics and countermeasures. Industry players believe that artificial intelligence (AI) may hold the key to driving the effectiveness of radar and EW.

Constant software evolution open standards and higher bandwidth are all key drivers of test and measurement designs in defense applications. Each also creates an environment where artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can enable improvements in performance that in turn enhance battlefield effectiveness.

The top trends for radar and EW test and measurement systems are more advanced modes for antijamming more adaptability in waveforms and leveraging of AI solutions to produce more effective systems says Haydn Nelson principal solutions manager for radar EW wireless and EO/IR test solutions at National Instruments (NI – Austin Texas).

“On the sensor side they use AI as a way to pull out threats from the chaos” he continues. “They’re building systems that may automatically do something based on a learned behavior and adapt to a threat. It will realize ‘Hey I’m trying to sense something and I realize I’m being jammed. I can be cognitively aware of that attempt to deny access and I can change my waveform or some parameter of the radar to avoid someone messing with me.’”

Testing the effectiveness of that AI is easier said than done however. One of the challenges testers run into is how to train an AI model with an unknown data set since threats exist that are both known and unknown.

“Algorithmic testing is a big challenge because of the complexity” Nelson notes. “We’re seeing a lot more people trying to find ways to do that in the digital realm like with simulation and then take a radar subsystem and hook it up to a digital environment emulator so you can do testing in the lab before you take it on the open-air range.”

Growing opportunities in AI

Chris Johnston director of radar and EW solutions for Keysight Technologies (Santa Rosa California) says he believes that the sheer volume of data collection in modern testing requires computer-assisted analysis of raw data.

“It is not feasible to have engineers and analysts scrub terabytes of data to find patterns signals of interest or interference” Johnston says. “AI can play a major role in reducing big data down to something actionable. Also when possible having open architectures provides end users a way to include their algorithms into the test system since much of the research is still proprietary research.” (Figure 1.)

Tim Fountain radar and EW market segment manager at Rohde & Schwarz (Columbia Maryland) notes that the testing community is “actually getting there” when it comes to AI although challenges remain.

“Now the challenge is everything has to be cognitive” he says. “Take spectrum sensing: The systems need to be able to look at the spectrum and make decisions in real time about where they can operate given geopolitical boundaries and where adversaries are operating. On top of that how do you actually create realistic environments for these cognitive systems?

“And that’s been one of the challenges” he continues. “Because in the majority of these situations you have to create real environments that look like what the thing is going to see when it gets out there – like congestion. The challenge becomes how do you create data sets that realistically model what systems are going to see such that we can train it?”

Fountain likens a new algorithm to a baby that doesn’t understand much at first: “You need to train the baby through real-world examples – don’t do that don’t touch that eat this” he says. “It’s a similar situation with these AI algorithms.”

Digital testing

Testing radar and EW equipment at an actual open-air range – such as Naval Air Weapons Station in China Lake California – is a critical step for new technology to be accepted since it is the only opportunity to test it against real-world systems and weapon stations Nelson says. These are expensive tests though so there are very few opportunities and the test must be run in one specific weather scenario one threat scenario and one environment. That reality creates a problem for testers who want to understand how the system will perform in another part of the world against a potential adversary often in challenging conditions he explains. “You’re going to need to do some of that testing digitally” Nelson points out. “There are a lot of threat emulators out there so we see a lot of people looking to do more of that in the lab.” (Figure 2.)

[Figure 2 | NI’s Radar Target Generation Driver built on the vector signal transceiver. (Illustration courtesy NI.)]

An ongoing challenge is that surrounding testing more technologies digitally and in the lab in realistic ways such as conducting multiple layers of testing and trying out different environments.

The ideal Nelson says is “being able to come up with digital models and then you can have a digital model of a certain threat scenario you can test over and over.”

A key problem in those models and scenarios however are those unknown unknown threats Fountain says. For example if you want to test how a radar detects a certain type of missile the problem is that you know the adversary will probably modify some of the operating parameters of the missile in an actual wartime situation so a radar has more trouble spotting it.

“As a result the system doesn’t fit a static library model” he observes. “You can’t go out in the real world and capture these new modes because adversaries are not operating them in those modes absent a real conflict. But that’s the real challenge: You’ve got to predict how something is going to work without knowing how something is really going to work.” (Figure 3.)

Software driving the industry

Systems are becoming more software-driven than ever before Nelson notes meaning that radar systems will have the ability to change and adapt waveforms frequencies and modes depending on the threat. Open standards have made it easier to develop these types of software for radar systems he says.

“If I’m an engineer and I’m designing a new mode on a radar where I’m trying to train for a new threat in the threat space I want to do that in software and do it quicker” he explains. “I think that’s another reason why they’ve pushed for open standards: because they can quickly upgrade hardware as software evolves. ‘Oh we’ve got to apply a larger model and our four-year-old processor is going to run out of steam.’ The benefit of open standards is we can do tech insertion.” All of that has to be mirrored on the test side Nelson says: “You have to have a software-defined test system.”

Keysight’s Johnston adds that software is key to the testing industry as it tries to find better ways to do modeling.

“There is a rapidly growing need for ­digital test beds so the software and firmware algorithms are testing in up-to-date software development paradigms – like continuous integration” he says. “This requires that the test and measurement testbeds run as digital twins so they are integrated and regression-tested many times in automated software loops. Ideally these same tests are migrated to full [hardware] test beds when the software is ready to test in actual deployments particularly for congested and contested environmental modeling in EW scenarios.”

5G’s future role

Another area of interest is the challenge of adopting 5G technology for military applications. While 5G offers tantalizing opportunities to the military to pass information on the battlefield more effectively and with less expensive hardware it also carries security issues that testers will need to resolve before it can be widely adopted in the defense arena.

“If you build anything that’s networked it can be hacked” Nelson says.

He also says that he supports such initiatives as the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) SDR competition. In last year’s challenge a team of undergraduates from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI – Worcester Massachusetts) used a $1200 radio to jam just one specific user which exposed a surprising vulnerability in the 5G standard.

“5G is great for commercial but I think DoD [the U.S. Department of Defense] will have to have their own version of the standard” he maintains. “They may reuse some of the terminal hardware but for tactical applications it needs to be hardened.”

Other complications arise from using 5G he adds: “They use some bands that get really close to radar bands” he observes. “As 5G goes global how does that impact radar and sensor systems out there? When we fly this specific radar system off the coast and they have a 5G network is it impacting our sensor systems?”

Darren McCarthy aerospace and defense industry segment manager at Rohde & Schwarz (Columbia Maryland) says that the commercial space is outspending the DoD 45-to-1 in satellite technology research so the military has a lot of catching up to do in this area. The DoD and the defense industry will have to find some way to make use of the commercial 5G technology already available.

“There’s no longer going to be a 20-year program to put up a satellite” McCarthy asserts. “[The military’s] going to use what’s up there and carve out a piece of the commercial network to utilize for themselves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy91c2ItNC12ZXJzaW9uLTJzLXNlY3JldC0xMjAtZ2Jwcy1tb2RlLWhhcy1hLWNhdGNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USB 4 Version 2's Secret 120 Gbps Mode Has a Catch,"When the USB Promoter Group announced its USB 4 Version 2 specification with a maximum 80 Gbps data transfer rate last week it did not reveal how it planned to make 80 Gbps work on existing cables. But apparently there is more than that. USB 4 can do even better and support aggregate bandwidth of up to 120 Gbps.

The USB Type-C connector has four lanes configured in a 2 Tx + 2 Rx symmetric arrangement which in the case of USB 4 operates at 20 Gbps per lane and therefore provides 80 Gbps bi-directional bandwidth. With USB 4 version 2 per lane data transfer rate is increased to 40 Gbps and aggregated bandwidth increases to 80 Gbps with PAM-3 encodings (in both directions) reports Angstronomics citing documents from Keysight a leading maker of test equipment.

But in addition to symmetric 2 Tx + 2 Rx setup Keysight's M8040A Bit Error Ratio Tester for USB 4 v2 can test asymmetric 3 Tx + 1 Rx configuration or 120 Gbps aggregated bandwidth from the host and 40 Gbps from device to host. It should be enough to carry a DisplayPort 2.0 UHBR20 signal (enough for 8Kp85 uncompressed and 8Kp144 with DSC) from the host to the display and then 40 Gbps (in both directions) will remain to handle data consumed by a USB 4 hub a webcam built into the display and so on.

So far the USB Promoter Group has not formally confirmed that a 3 Tx + 1 Rx asymmetric configuration support would come to USB 4. Still asymmetric configurations are nothing new for USB specifications. They are particularly easy to enable in the case of USB 4 (as well as Thunderbolt 3/4) as all signal types are muxed and demuxed at each end of the interconnection.

Now assuming that a 3 Tx + 1 Rx asymmetric setup is a part of the USB 4 v2 specification a major question is whether support for 3 Tx + 1 Rx asymmetric will be mandatory for all USB 4 v2 controllers or will be optional and reserved for select controllers only. Increasing per lane data transfer rate to 40 Gbps and implementing PAM-3 encoding will significantly increase the complexity and power consumption of USB 4 v2 controllers compared to USB 4 v2 controllers. Furthermore increased bandwidth will require USB 4 v2 controllers to connect to hosts at around 15 GB/s (equal to bandwidth offered by a PCIe 5.0 x4 or a PCIe 6.0 x2 interface). Supporting a 120 Gbps upstream mode might complicate things further.

When can we expect the first USB 4 v2 host controllers to arrive? Angstronomics believes that Intel will support USB 4 v2 with its 14th Generation Core 'Meteor Lake' platform in 2023 as the company has already implied support of 80 Gbps Thunderbolt input/output interface by its media. As for AMD it will lag behind Intel and will only offer CPUs with USB 4 v2 support in 2025. As usual it is hard to make predictions about Apple.

We have reached out to the USB Promoter Group and enquired whether the final edition of USB 4 v2 supports the 3 Tx + 1 Rx asymmetric configuration. Unfortunately for now the organization neither denies nor confirms this.

High Yield Dividend King #20: Target Corporation (TGT)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Target is a giant discount retailer. Its business consists of about 1850 big box stores which offer general merchandise and food as well as serving as distribution points for the company’s burgeoning e-commerce business. Target should produce about $110 billion in total revenue this year.

Target reported first quarter earnings on May 18th 2022 and results were much worse than expected from a margin perspective. Adjusted earnings-per-share missed estimates by 87 cents at $2.19. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $25.2 billion which was $690 million ahead of estimates.

Comparable sales grew 3.3% which was due to traffic growth of 3.9% and a slightly lower average ticket size. Store comparable sales were up 3.4% while digital comparable sales grew 3.2%. Operating income was $1.3 billion down from $2.4 billion driven primarily by a lower gross margin rate. Gross margins plunged from 30.0% to 25.7% of sales due to higher markdowns and costs related to freight supply chain disruptions and increased wages.

The company noted operating margin rate should be roughly where it was in Q1 for Q2 and the company expects to see low- to mid-single digit revenue growth and operating income margin around 6% for the year.

High Yield Dividend King #19: Illinois Tool Works (ITW)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Illinois Tool Works is a diversified multi-industrial manufacturer with seven unique operating segments: Automotive Food Equipment Test & Measurement Welding Polymers & Fluids Construction Products and Specialty Products. Last year the company generated $14.5 billion in revenue. The company is geographically diversified with more than half of its revenue generated outside of the United States.

On August 2nd 2022 Illinois Tool Works reported second quarter 2022 results for the period ending June 30th 2022. For the quarter revenue came in at $4.0 billion up 9% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% in the Automotive OEM segment the largest out of the company’s seven segments. Five of the other segments saw sales growth above 20% with the last segment being flat. Net income equaled $738 million or $2.37 per share compared to $775 million or $2.45 per share in Q2 2021.

Source: Investor Presentation

Illinois Tool Works also reiterated its 2022 earnings guidance and sees $9.00 to $9.40 in earnings-per-share for the full year. At the same time the company reduced its revenue growth estimates to 6% to 9% (down from 8.5% to 11.5%). The company also plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2022.

Illinois Tool Works has an excellent dividend growth history. Its payout ratio was relatively high during the last financial crisis but the company was not forced to cut the payout. Today the dividend payout ratio sits at 53% of expected earnings above the company’s long-term target meaning that future dividend growth may trail earnings growth.

High Yield Dividend King #18: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Procter & Gamble is a consumer products giant that sells its products in over 180 countries. Notable brands include Pampers Luvs Tide Gain Bounty Charmin Puffs Gillette Head & Shoulders Old Spice Dawn Febreze Swiffer Crest Oral-B Scope Olay and many more. The company generated $76 billion in sales in fiscal 2021.

Procter & Gamble has paid a dividend for 131 years and has grown its dividend for 66 consecutive years – one of the longest active streaks of any company. On April 12th 2022 Procter & Gamble raised its dividend by 5.0% from $0.8698 per quarter to $0.9133.

Source: Investor Presentation

Procter & Gamble’s dividend payout ratio has oscillated between 50% and 75% in the last decade with the current mark coming in around 60%. This is somewhat high for your typical company but well within a reasonable range for such a high-quality firm. We believe that the company can keep growing its dividend at a rate roughly in line with earnings-pershare growth going forward.

Procter & Gamble has significant competitive advantages thanks to its strong brands. The company has several categoryleading brands. These brands provide Procter & Gamble with pricing power and consistent profits in good times or bad. During the Great Recession the company posted earnings-per-share of $3.04 $3.64 $3.58 $3.53 and $3.93 in the 2007 through 2011 stretch while the dividend kept on rising.

High Yield Dividend King #17: PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)

Dividend Yield: 2.6%

PepsiCo is a global food and beverage company that generates $82 billion inannual sales. The company’s brands include Pepsi Mountain Dew Frito–Lay chips Gatorade Tropicana orange juice and Quaker foods. The company hasmore than 20 $1 billion brands in its portfolio.

Source: Investor Presentation

On 2/10/2022 PepsiCo announced that it would increase its annualized dividend by 7% to $4.60 starting with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2022 making the company a Dividend King. The company also announced a share repurchase authorization of up to $10 billion.

On July 12th 2022 PepsiCo reported second quarter results for the period ending June 30th 2022. Revenue grew 5.3% to $20.2 billion topping analysts’ estimates by $720 million. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.86 compared to $1.72 in the prior year and was $0.12 better than expected. Organic sales for the second quarter were up 13%. Beverages and foods had volume growth of 6% and 3% respectively.

PepsiCo Beverages North America’s revenue grew 9% organically though volume was lower by 1%. Frito-Lay North America’s revenue grew 14% despite a 2% decline in volume. Quaker Foods North America was up 18% aided mostly by pricing but also a 2% increase in volume. Revenues in Europe were higher by 9% as pricing offset weakness in volume.

PepsiCo provided a revised outlook for 2022 as well with the company still expecting adjusted earnings-per-share of $6.63 for the year. Organic sales are now projected to be up 10% compared to the prior year compared to 8% and 6% previously.

High Yield Dividend King #16: Cincinnati Financial (CINF)

Dividend Yield: 2.6%

Cincinnati Financial is an insurance company founded in 1950. It offers business home auto insurance and financial products including life insurance annuities property and casualty insurance. Cincinnati Financial is headquartered in Fairfield Ohio trading with a $20.1 billion market capitalization.

As an insurance company Cincinnati Financial makes money in two ways. It earns income from premiums on policies written and by investing its float or the large sum of money consisting of the time value between the premium income and insurance claims.

Cincinnati Financial has grown earnings by 11.5% per year over the past nine years and 15.6% over the past five years. Consensus analysts expect earnings to grow by 6% for the next five years. Book value a significant metric for insurance companies has increased by 10.4% over the past nine years and 8.4% over the past five years.

Unlike many insurers the company is not a significant buyer of its shares for per-share growth. The company makes most of its net income from its investment gains and is highly dependent on bond interest rates and stock market performance. Cincinnati Financial is a somewhat aggressive investor and has a 39.3% allocation to equities compared to many insurers. This gives the company better long-term portfolio growth but a bit more volatility.

High Yield Dividend King #15: National Fuel Gas Co. (NFG)

Dividend Yield: 2.6%

National Fuel Gas Co. is a diversified energy company that operates in five business segments: Exploration & Production Pipeline & Storage Gathering Utility and Energy Marketing. The company’s largest segment is Exploration & Production.

Source: Investor Presentation

In early May National Fuel Gas reported (5/5/22) financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The company grew its production by 2% over the prior year’s quarter primarily thanks to the development of core acreage positions in Appalachia.

In addition the price of natural gas rallied thanks to strong demand and tight supply. As a result adjusted earnings-per-share grew 25% from $1.34 to $1.68 and exceeded analysts’ consensus by $0.06.

The price of natural gas has rallied to a 13-year high lately due to the sanctions of Europe on Russia for its invasion in Ukraine. Thanks to this tailwind National Fuel Gas raised its guidance for the earnings-pershare of 2022 again from $5.20-$5.50 to $5.70-$6.00 for 36% growth at the mid-point.

High Yield Dividend King #12: Computer Services (CSVI)

Dividend Yield: 2.9%

Computer Services provides regional banks with a wide range of services such as core processing digital banking payments processing and regulatory compliance solutions.

In early May Computer Services reported (5/4/2022) financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company grew its revenue by 7% from $75.5 million to a nearly all-time high of $81.0 million and its earnings-per-share by 24% from $0.49 to $0.61 thanks to new accounts continued demand for digital banking services and higher demand for payments processing and regulatory compliance.

Notably approximately 90% of the total revenues are generated from long-term contracts. Management expects to accelerate investments in the business in the new fiscal year.

Given also higher staffing levels and a return to pre-pandemic travel levels management expects earnings growth to somewhat decelerate later this year. In September Computer Services raised its dividend by 8.0% which marked the 50th consecutive year of dividend growth.

Computer Services has grown its earnings-per-share at an 11.3% average annual rate over the last decade. The pandemic has not affected the performance of Computer Services at all. Thanks to sustained momentum in the core business and no signs of fatigue we expect it to grow its earnings-per-share by 7.0% per year over the next five years.

The impressive growth record of Computer Services is a testament to the strength of its business model and the existence of a significant competitive advantage. The company signs multi-year contracts with its customers and offers them a wide range of services. It is very costly and inefficient for these customers to stop working with the

company particularly given that they pay appreciable early termination fees.

As a result Computer Services enjoys high renewal rates. In fact when it loses a customer the most frequent reason is that the bank has been acquired by another bank that is not a customer of Computer Services.

Revenues for the quarter amounted to $726 18.1% higher year-over-year while EPS came in at $0.39 compared to a loss of $0.03 in Q2-2022.

A drizzle of HP sauce or ketchup for you?

Domino’s is putting itself on the map as a breakfast destination thanks to a new partnership with Heinz.

It might just be the perfect hangover cure too.

Available now this new breakfast pizza comes with the classic meaty toppings you’d expect from an English fry up.

The limited edition pizza comes with Cumberland sausage smoked bacon mushrooms and chunky chopped tomatoes – with a lashing of either ketchup or HP sauce on top. The choice is yours.

We imagine the options will divide some friends and couples.

Yum (Picture: Domino’s)

Only using Heinz sauces the tomato-based pizza with mozzarella is the sauciest of Domino’s pizzas yet.

The collaboration has been in the making for more than a year according to Domino’s who say getting the toppings just right took time.

Chloé Schiltz from Kraft Heinz said: ‘Long has the nation debated on whether you put Heinz Tomato Ketchup or HP Sauce on your breakfast and we can’t wait to find out which of our sauces reigns supreme on Domino’s Big Brekkie pizza.’

The Big Brekkie pizza is available now to order online through the Domino’s app or from your nearest store.

Now excuse us we’re debating whether to go with sweet ketchup or tangy HP on ours.

What You Need To Know A reimagined Kroger Wellness Festival returns to downtown Cincinnati in late September



World Cup champion Abby Wambach entrepreneur and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen and self-made businesswoman Bethenny Frankel are among the notable list of participants



The two-day event brings together leading experts in food exercise medicine and mental health panel discussions and demonstrations



The event also features entertainment such as a soccer clinic and concerts by Eli Young Band and Fitz and The Tantrums

Since debuting in 2018 the two-day health and wellness festival has brought in leading experts in food exercise medicine and mental health for a jam-packed schedule of panel discussions demonstrations and other programming.

This year’s event is no different. So far there are more than 60 panel discussions food demonstrations and musical performances scheduled between Friday Sept. 23 and Saturday Sept. 24 at The Banks in downtown Cincinnati.

Award-winning country music group Eli Young Band is set to headline a concert early Friday night. Multi-platinum band Fitz and The Tantrums take the stage Saturday afternoon.

Last year’s headliner was singer-songwriter Jewel.

“The Wellness Festival will provide a variety of interactive healthy opportunities for the entire family” said Colleen Lindholz president of Kroger Health the health care division of Cincinnati-based The Kroger Co. “We are pleased that athletes and celebrities will join us as we create an environment where the community can be inspired to take a step forward in their wellness journey.”

Both days of wellness expo call for full lineups of activity from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. taking place across four stages. Each session focuses on at least one of Kroger Wellness’ six core pillars of transformation: balance move breathe care uplift and play.

This year’s headliner is Wambach a two-time Olympic gold medalist and FIFA World Cup Champion for the U.S. Women’s National Team. On Friday morning she kicks off the event with a moderated conversation and Q&A session. A public meet and greet to follow.

Later that day Teigen — author of New York Times bestseller “Cravings: Recipes for All of the Food You Want to Eat” — hosts a 30-min cooking segment and fireside chat alongside her mother Pepper Teigen a best-selling cookbook author and Food Network star.

At 3:15 p.m. Friday Frankel — a reality TV star-turned-businesswoman — shares her approach to “fearlessly leading with her gut embracing being a “multi-hyphenate woman and laying a foundation for greatness through investing in her wellness” according to a statement from Kroger Wellness.

The free event will also feature a play area for kids of all ages. The family fun activities include a rock-climbing wall a kid-friendly ninja course and more.

The event started in 2018 as The Wellness Your Way Festival. It was a collaboration between Jewel Inclusion Companies and Kroger. Jewel called the Queen City the logical host site given the fact it’s Kroger’s home base.

Back in May 2018 Kroger unveiled an exclusive U.S. partnership with U.K.-based online grocery specialist Ocado Group. The aggressive plan called for the companies to identify sites for about 20 automated customer fulfillment centers (CFCs) in the United States over the next three years. These high-tech Kroger CFCs would use Ocado’s vertical integration machine learning and robotics to fill e-grocery delivery orders providing the supermarket giant with the capacity speed and efficiency to serve a market base stretching across more than 2700 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia plus vast online properties.

Many industry analysts called the Ocado alliance a big win for Kroger. Not only would it would turn up the competitive heat on rivals and blaze a path to profitability in online grocery but it also would give Kroger potentially national scale in grocery e-commerce — including states and markets where it doesn’t operate brick-and-mortar stores.

However other analysts saw the Ocado deal as a risky bet for Kroger. They described the CFC model as capital- and labor-intensive and said the big centers — scaling to well over 300000 square feet — would take too long to open be situated too far from customers (adding costs for transportation and supporting facilities) and possibly cannibalize sales from stores. Such large-scale operations they noted also would require dense markets to achieve ROI and profitability at a time when online penetration in the U.S. grocery market stood at low single digits.

Fast forward to August 2022. Kroger has announced 17 CFCs overall — ranging from 135000 to 375000 square feet — and six are now open. To support the regional CFCs and enlarge their service area the Cincinnati-based company also has announced 12 Ocado-automated “spoke” facilities of 40000 to 80000 square feet with seven now live. One operational CFC and three spokes have brought Kroger into one new state and upcoming facilities stand to extend its geographic reach into two more states and one new region.

Meanwhile the COVID-19 pandemic has hoisted online grocery sales. The market rose from 2.7% and 3.4% of total U.S. grocery sales in 2018 and 2019 to 8.1% and 9.5% in 2020 and 2021 according to the Mercatus/Incisiv “eGrocery Transformed” report. That percentage is expected to hit 11.1% in 2022 and 13.5% in 2023 climbing to 20.5% by 2026.

The U.S. also now has a lot more online grocery shoppers. In 2019 33.8% of the population were digital grocery buyers eMarketer reported. But since the onset of COVID that share jumped to 47.8% in 2020 49.7% in 2021 and 51.3% in 2022 with a forecast to reach 52.4% in 2023 and 53.3% in 2024.

Against that backdrop Kroger stands strongly positioned as a leader in fresh foods own brands consumer data and analytics and omnichannel shopping — the company’s “competitive moats” of “Fresh Our Brands Personalization and Seamless.”

For its vision and embrace of innovation in executing its “Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital” strategy The Kroger Co. has been named as the 2022 Retailer of the Year by Supermarket News.

“In every decision we make we do what we think is right for customers and right for our associates as we look 10 years into the future” Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen told SN in an interview.

“From everything that we could see the customer really wants and needs a retailer that’s able to serve them with physical stores pickup and delivery. And what we find is that customers bounce back and forth between those channels depending on what’s going on in their household. When you look at the long-term trend we fundamentally believed that would become increasingly important” McMullen said. “And then you look at how do you do that efficiently? We’ve always told our investors job one is to make sure we take care of the customer but as they move to online that customer is not as profitable. So job two is to figure out how to serve that customer profitably. When you look at the overall ecosystem that’s really what led us to Ocado.”

Ocado network takes shape

Kroger opened its first Ocado CFC a 375000-square-foot automated warehouse or “shed” in April 2021 in Monroe Ohio. That was followed by 375000-square-foot CFCs in Groveland Fla. in June 2021 and in Forest Park Ga. this past February and a 340000-square-foot CFC in Pleasant Prairie Wis. in June. Most recently CFCs of 135000 and 350000 square feet went operational in Romulus Mich. and Dallas respectively.

The Ocado CFCs use automation and artificial intelligence to service online grocery orders with on-site associates supporting delivery operations and helping to process package and load orders.

In the Monroe CFC for example more than 1000 bots containing totes with products and ready customer orders dart across huge 3D grids — known as “The Hive” — managed by air-traffic control systems. When order delivery times near the bots retrieve the products from The Hive and bring them to pick stations where items are sorted for delivery. Algorithms control the pick-and-sort process to ensure that products are packed intelligently with fragile items on top and bags evenly weighted. Next packed orders are loaded into a temperature-controlled Kroger Delivery van that can hold up to 20 orders. Machine-learning algorithms weigh factors such as road conditions and fuel efficiency to optimize delivery routes.

Shoppers place their orders via Kroger.com or the Kroger mobile app. Each Ocado CFC covers a delivery radius of up to 90 miles. Depending on its size a CFC can equal the sales of about 20 stores according to Kroger. At full capacity annual sales per module — the Monroe CFC has seven modules — are projected at $80 million to $100 million.

The Kroger Co. So far Kroger has six Ocado-automated CFCs and nine supporting spoke facilities operational.

“Ocado is incredibly efficient. The thing that I’ve always been impressed with since signing our original agreement with Ocado is not so much what they were then but what they will become” McMullen explained. “We had studied Ocado on and off over the years and the thing that always impressed us was that they just kept getting better and better. And they continue to aggressively invest in R&D. That R&D is focused on two things: how to improve the customer experience and how to improve the efficiency of the operation. Since we’ve developed a deeper partnership with them they’ve really improved the consistency and the experience for the customer. That’s why we identified Ocado why we partnered with them and why we’re pleased with the continued progress that we’re making.”

Upcoming Ocado CFCs Kroger reported include locations in Frederick Md.; Phoenix; Charlotte N.C.; Aurora Colo.; the Cleveland region; the Pacific Northwest; and the Northeast. The retailer too has announced plans for two CFCs in Southern California and two more in Florida.

The Kroger Delivery network also includes Ocado-powered spoke facilities that serve as last-mile cross-dock sites to help the CFC “hubs” process online grocery and fresh food orders and extend their service radius up to 200 miles. Spokes are now live in Miami Tampa and Jacksonville Fla.; Lockbourne Ohio; Indianapolis; Louisville Ky.; and San Antonio. Other spokes are slated to open in Oklahoma City; Austin Texas;Birmingham Ala.; Nashville Tenn.; and Maywood Ill.

“It’s one of those things where you continue to learn and each one gets a little bit easier to operate than the first one” said McMullen. “The thing that I focus on every single week is our Net Promoter Scores from the customer our repeat purchase rate and how customers engage with us both in physical stores and pickup and delivery. In all those things we will continue to make progress. I’m really proud of all the hard work everyone has done and really pleased with where we are.”

Reaching into new markets

The opening of the Groveland CFC and its three supporting spokes enabled Kroger for all practical purposes to enter a new state: Florida. Previously the company only had a Harris Teeter supermarket in the Jacksonville area.

Delivery to South Florida launched in June following the inception of service to the greater Orlando Tampa and Jacksonville areas. Last October Kroger said it plans to build two small CFCs in South Florida that will join its live e-grocery operations in Central Florida. The new sites are slated to include a “Zoom” micro-fulfillment center that will enable Kroger Delivery in as soon as 30 minutes from a selection of 10000 fresh food items and essentials plus a larger facility offering same-day and next-day service from an assortment of 35000 items according to Kroger.

The Kroger Co. The Ocado CFCs serve a delivery radius of about 90 miles extended to up to 200 miles by spoke fulfillment sites.

“It’s fascinating. In Florida over half of the customers knew that Kroger sold groceries. Now the thing we have to help customers in Florida understand is they can buy them from us not just at a physical store” McMullen noted. “The other thing that the [Ocado] sheds will allow us to do is test different things. In Dallas we’re actually testing serving restaurants in that market right through our shed [CFC]. And then there’s leveraging Our Brands. One of the things I’ve really been pleased with is the fact that Our Brands’ share of market in Florida is actually a little bit better than in our historical core markets. That just shows the strength and the quality of Our Brands.”

The 50000-square-foot spoke in Oklahoma City due to go into operation later this year will support the Dallas CFC and bring Kroger into Oklahoma its 36th state. Likewise the Cleveland region CFC will serve areas in northeastern Ohio and Pennsylvania with the latter representing the grocer’s 37th state. In October 2021 Kroger announced plans to build a CFC in the Northeast — where it has no physical stores — but has yet to provide details about the facility and its opening time frame.

“Long term one of our visions is to serve America because we think everybody deserves fresh affordable food” said McMullen. “It allows us to go into new markets with something different than what is already there and do it in a way that’s efficient. And you can scale off of it over time. So that’s one more way of taking care of customers and supporting communities.”

Cultivating a seamless ecosystem

The Ocado network will underpin the e-commerce portion of what Kroger envisions as a “seamless” ecosystem with customers able to easily move between channels — brick-and-mortar stores and digital and among in-store shopping pickup and delivery — and get the same high-quality experience.

Currently The Kroger Co. operates 2723 supermarkets and multi-department stores under more than 20 banners including Kroger Ralphs Dillons Smith’s King Soopers Fry’s QFC City Market Owen’s Jay C Pay Less Baker’s Gerbes Harris Teeter Pick N’ Save Metro Market Mariano’s Fred Meyer Food 4 Less and Foods Co. More than 2250 stores have pharmacies and over 1600 have fuel centers. Eighty-two percent of Kroger’s customers within five miles of one of its stores with most living within two miles.

On the digital side as of the fiscal 2021 year-end 2257 stores provided online grocery pickup and over 2500 stores offered delivery. Including click-and-collect and delivery via Kroger Delivery third-party partners such as Instacart and Kroger’s Ship direct-to-home service the company covered 98% of households in its trade area with e-commerce services.

The Kroger Co. Kroger serves over 60 million households annually through its stores and digital properties.

“When customers engage with us we think it’s really important. We call it ‘zero compromise.’ Customers should never have to compromise an experience and that’s everything from how easy is it fair and reasonable prices using our data to personalize the experience and making sure the product is incredibly fresh” explained McMullen. “When you look at our [Ocado] sheds that’s part of the seamless system and it facilitates that overall connection with the customer in all those dimensions. It also makes it incredibly easy to be consistent with the experience for the customer. One of the things I think is important relative to some of our competitors is that the consistency of our seamless [digital] experiences are the same consistency that you would have when you go into the stores every day.”

Digital represents a more than $10 billion annual business for Kroger. About 18.5 million households engaged online with the retailer in 2021 and in the fiscal 2022 first quarter digitally engaged households grew by another half-million. Kroger also made further enhancements to its seamless experience.

“Our seamless ecosystem continues to deliver fresh products to our customers anytime anywhere and with zero compromise” McMullen told analysts in a conference call on Q1 results. “During the first quarter more customers returned to in-store shopping and as a result we made strides to enhance that experience while introducing new tools that help our associates better serve customers. In pickup we unveiled new technology that improved wait times 20% and expanded capacity based on customer needs. In delivery we continue to introduce key initiatives that expand our reach and shorten delivery times. We strive to provide more customers access to high-quality affordable food regardless of whether they have a physical store in their community.”

In March during a 2022 business update event with investors Kroger reiterated its goal from 2021 to double its digital sales and passthrough profitability rate by the end of 2023 driven by its seamless experience and ecosystem.

“We’re continuing to make progress” McMullen told SN. “COVID accelerated the growth of seamless and digital business by three or four years and that stayed with us. On the end of the last earnings call [Q1] I mentioned that our seamless business had turned positive in terms of sales growth. It’s also important to note that almost all of the customers that used to shop digital and got comfortable coming back to stores are coming back to stores at Kroger. So it just shows you the ability for people to move back and forth. And we have continued to see household growth in terms of people engaging with us digitally.”

The Kroger Co. Kroger's vision is for customers to easily move between channels — brick-and-mortar stores and digital and among in-store shopping pickup and delivery — and get the same high-quality experience.

In July Kroger rolled out its eight-month-old Boost by Kroger online benefits program nationwide. Boost comes two membership tiers at $59 or $99 annually. All members get free delivery for online orders of $35 or more and double fuel points (up to $1 off per gallon of gasoline) for each dollar spent on groceries and general merchandise. The $59 annual membership provides delivery within 24 hours while the $99-per-year option offers delivery in as soon as two hours. Those signing up for either Boost membership tier get a one-time welcome kit valued at over $100. Kroger said the kit offsets the first-year cost of membership and estimated that Boost can save customers more than $1000 per year on fuel and grocery delivery.

The subscription program initially was piloted in Kroger’s Cincinnati-Dayton Columbus Atlanta and Central divisions. “Delivery [sales] increased significantly compared to non-Boost divisions and delivery retention improved approximately 600 basis points” McMullen said in the Q1 analyst call.

Leading with fresh serving up Our Brands

Fresh foods also are major catalyst for customer engagement across Kroger’s seamless ecosystem. In Kroger’s March business update Stuart Aitken chief merchant and marketing officer noted that fresh is the No. 1 determinant of store choice as 70% of customers base their choice of shopping venue on fresh products and 92% of Kroger’s shoppers buy fresh products.

Since 2019 the retailer has seen 15.6% sales growth in fresh departments and in Q1 2022 identical sales grew 5.2% in fresh. Helping to drive that gain was the acceleration of Kroger’s End-to-End Fresh Produce initiative.

The Kroger Co. Kroger said it's winning customers and market share with strong offerings in its fresh food departments.

“When you look at fresh the majority of our customers decide where to shop based on the fresh experience and it’s something that Kroger has always started with and had a strength versus competitors” McMullen said in the interview. “And it’s an opportunity for us to even get better because there are plenty of opportunities to improve. At the end of the last quarter we announced that we had 355 new stores certified on End-to-End Fresh Produce. Our expectation is that over time you’ll hear us continuing to add share as that accelerates.

“The other thing is we’re in a unique position when you think about food as medicine” he added. “We have the ability — given our produce departments physical stores and expertise in health and wellness — to really merge those two. And we’re starting to work with outside partners to better understand that.”

Through the End-to-End program Kroger leverages data science and partner collaboration to fine-tune produce distribution cut the time from farm to table and ensure supply-chain stakeholders are working together to reduce the age of the product minimize dwell time in the distribution network and maintain the cold chain. In stores the retailer is bolstering vendor accountability by updating technology that provides real-time data to suppliers to deliver more days of freshness.

“The produce departments in our initial rollout are performing better than similar stores that haven’t implemented the in-store portion of our end-to-end process and we have plans for continued rollout in 2022” Aitken reported in the update event. “And produce is just the beginning of our end-to-end initiative. We see similar opportunities across the store in meat and seafood and of course in dairy.”

Kroger’s Our Brands private-label lineup is another big draw for customers. An approximately $28 billion annual business which would make Kroger the ninth-largest U.S. CPG company the portfolio encompasses nearly 20 brands and offers 14000 items. Four labels are billion-dollar brands including Simple Truth Private Selection Home Chef and Kroger — the latter being the largest by far with sales of $15 billion and Simple Truth the nation’s largest natural/organic brand. Meal kit brand Home Chef joined the billion-dollar club in 2021.

More than 660 new Our Brands items were added in fiscal 2021 followed by another 239 in the 2022 first quarter. Identical sales of Our Brands in Q1 rose 6.3% eclipsing growth for national brands according to Kroger.

“If you look at last quarter the growth of Our Brands outpaced the overall growth of the company” McMullen said. “The Our Brands team is made up of Kroger people and external people from the CPG world who are very knowledgeable of innovation in brand products. It’s really the best of all those together. And every year we’re introducing new products. Last year I think we introduced [over 600] and I know this year we’re on pace to exceed that. Part of that is how do you keep it fresh? How do you keep it interesting for the customer? And you know they don’t have to compromise because of the great value for the money and incredible quality.”

The Kroger Co. As Kroger builds its omnichannel network the reach of its Our Brands private-label portfolio could extend to markets where the grocer lacks physical stores.

Catering to the customer

Kroger noted that its more than 20 years of investment in data science has enabled the company to leverage the information across its physical and virtual properties and brands to create personalized experiences and value for our customers. Overall Kroger serves more than 60 million households annually and 96% of customer transactions are tied to Kroger loyalty program.

“Data is only important when you use it in a way that’s helpful for the customer. What we try to do is to make sure that every customer has a unique experience with us and that’s what’s important to them and their household. So we’ll use our data right now obviously with inflation to try to help people stretch their budget. We also make sure we thank customers for shopping with us. So we offer them something we know is important to them or their household” said McMullen. “You may notice every year we announce what we see as food trends. Well those food trends are coming out of what we’re seeing with our data. And it’s how we also allocate resources in introducing new products for Our Brands as well.”

Chief Information Officer Yael Cosset said at the business update event that Kroger’s expanded loyalty and personalization platform enables the retailer to “provide value that matters to each customer” with more than 2trillion relevant recommendations and 50% of items added to the basket due to personalized search. Omnichannel customers are the most exposed to personalization he said and exhibit 98% retention and spend two to four times what an average customer spends.

Data and technology are “key to our mission to elevate the customer experience and grow sales” according to Mary Ellen Adcock senior vice president of operations for Kroger. During the update event she said that in 2021 Kroger introduced a new fresh production automated forecasting and ordering application using artificial intelligence. Real-time analytics also are available to coach associates to help them make better and faster decisions based on customer data and operational data.

“What’s so exciting about technology is that you continue to figure out how to make things even better” McMullen said in the interview. “That’s the thing that’s so important. Tomorrow we’ll give customers a better experience than they had yesterday. We always will focus on making sure that every single day we serve the customer a little bit better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3dhcm5pbmdzLWZyb20tZm9ybWVyLWtyb2dlci1lbXBsb3llZXMtbmV3cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Warnings to Shoppers From Former Kroger Employees,"Kroger is one of the most popular grocery chains in America offering deals on everything from food to fuel. Headquartered in Cincinnati Ohio the company operates more than 2700 grocery stores in the U.S. known for their stellar customer service and low prices. But before you visit the largest grocery store chain in America (or order delivery using their new service that's popping up all over) there are some important insider tips you'll want to be aware of. Read on for shopping warnings from former Kroger employees.

READ THIS NEXT: 8 Warnings to Shoppers From Ex-Costco Employees.

1 Your cart might be sounding the alarm.

If you've ever left a Kroger and had the alarm sound on you even though you certainly paid for all your items your cart could be to blame. After a customer complained on Reddit that they were stopped by the alarm six different times a current employee weighed in. ""The carts automatically go off [if] they don't have a sensor turned off. That sensor is turned off when they pass through a register.""

This is of course to prevent theft but if you wheel your cart too far from the register which is especially common at self-checkout the sensor may not turn off. This also can happen if you wheel your cart through the checkout lane too quickly the employee explains.

2 Employee wages are not equal at all stores.

No matter how much you love shopping at Kroger it's important to be aware of the people who make this possible. Lately some employees have been complaining about low pay. Kroger employs roughly 420000 people some of whom went on strike over their wages at the beginning of 2022. As The Guardian reported at the time ""More than 8000 workers at nearly 80 Kroger-owned King Soopers grocery stores around Colorado started a three-week strike… as new union contract negotiations stalled."" The workers claimed that despite the company seeing big gains during the pandemic their wages did not increase accordingly.

More recently on Reddit an employee complained about low wages in the deli department. However several other Kroger employees explained they make much more based on their location. In fact one commenter said ""I went from $12.50/hr to $16.40/hr after we went on strike. I'm in colorado.""

3 Avoid telling employees how to do their jobs.

Kroger employees are friendly but according to this Reddit thread the thing they hate most is when customers tell them how to do their job. One Redditor shared a story about a customer telling them they ""forgot how to order"" when there wasn't enough hand sanitizer on the shelves. Another wrote that it's even a problem when it comes to checking out saying customers ""nitpick…about how I bag their groceries.""

If you're shopping in Kroger make sure to be kind to the employees and think before offering guidance. It might be tempting to give advice but they know what they're doing.

4 Bakers aren't always trained.

Do you love ordering freshly baked cake or muffins from the bakery? Cross your fingers that the baker at your Kroger has experience because they don't always undergo training. A Kroger bakery employee shared on Reddit ""Beyond the two-day bakery training at another store I have no commercial bakery experience.""ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

And while your cupcakes may still taste yummy it's a stressful situation for the bakers. ""I feel like I'm getting set up for failure or at least a couple of really [bad] bakes before I get the hang of things"" shared the employee. Commenters weighed in and explained that many of the bakers don't receive training and instead learn at home especially if stores are short-handed.

5 Don't make ridiculous delivery orders.

Now that Kroger is offering its delivery service in many places it's tempting to start ordering all your items. But make sure you're being sensible about what's going on your order. In a recent Reddit thread concerning the ""stupidest thing you saw a customer and/or employee do"" a Kroger alum describes customers putting in separate orders with only one item each (for which you'll be charged extra fees) or ordering problematic items in bulk.

If your order is questionable a manager can go ahead and cancel it. For example the former employee described a customer who put in an order for ""30 2pks of frozen pie crust the week before Thanksgiving."" Needless to say this order was canceled."

The new UK Space Power doctrine brings together government policy and strategy “to provide a basis for understanding the utility of the space domain in the military context” MOD said announcing the new doctrine published Sept. 1. Space doctrine was previously part of “UK Air and Space Power” but now stands on its own.

The document lays out that the U.K. considers there to be four key roles for space power: space domain awareness space control space support to operations and space service support. Space domain awareness combines situational awareness with surveillance and tracking. Space control is defined as “the use of defensive and offensive capabilities to assure access and freedom of action in space.” Space support to operations is how space supports U.K. military capabilities and Space service support encompasses operations that launch space assets.

The doctrine is an in-depth explainer of the U.K. space environment including the benefits and threats of space how UK space command and control is conducted and how the space domain integrates with other domains like air and cyber.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston wrote in the foreword that this doctrine comes at a “pivotal” moment for U.K. space defense and the doctrine is meant as a “comprehensive unclassified understanding of space power” and can evolve with feedback.

“Space power is rarely used in isolation but forms part of an integrated approach comprising operations across multiple operational domains set alongside cross-government activities. Moreover due to the nature of the space domain collaboration with our allies and commercial partners on all space matters is fundamental to our collective success in the employment of space power” Wigston said.

The U.K. is increasing its emphasis on space and released the first-ever National Space Strategy about a year ago with the goal to invest in the national space economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbG9yaWRhdG9kYXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L21vbmV5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDUvZmFzdC1ncm93aW5nLWJvb3otYWxsZW4tcGxhbnMtaW5jcmVhc2luZy1tZWxib3VybmUtc3RhZmYvNzk2MTc5NDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fast-growing Booz Allen plans increasing Melbourne staff by 100 to 150,"A relatively new player in the Space Coast's technology sector is making a big impression with its fast expansion.

After technology and consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. acquired Liberty IT Solutions LLC in June 2021 it expanded the company's 200-employee Melbourne operations to more than 300. And it now could be hiring 100 to 150 more people within a year for the Melbourne operation.

Booz Allen's Melbourne ""Agile Center of Excellence"" at 505 N. John Rodes Blvd. is primarily involved software development for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Melbourne operation also does work for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as well as flight safety software applications for the Federal Aviation Administration.

Lynda Weatherman president and chief executive officer of the Economic Development Commission of Florida’s Space Coast said Booz Allen's acquisition of Liberty followed by its expansion of the local operation is a positive sign for the high-tech sector locally.

""The local presence of this esteemed global firm and their addition of 100 jobs in its first year reflects positively on our growing skilled workforce which ranked the seventh-best for job growth in the U.S. by the Milken Institute"" Weatherman said.

Challenges in job market:Brevard employers continue to face hurdles of tight labor market in filling vacancies

Weatherman was among the officials attending a recent special reception at the company's Melbourne facility at which Booz Allen Hamilton President and CEO Horacio Rozanski visited to talk with employees and local business officials. The event also marked a ceremonial ""grand reopening"" of the facility following extensive remote work by staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In commenting on his visit to Melbourne Rozanski said: “Booz Allen is thrilled to be part of the Melbourne community. The Space Coast region offers exceptional technical talent strong partners and opportunities to drive transformation for our clients at the intersection of mission and technology. Our team’s commitment to making a difference especially for our nation's veterans is truly inspiring. I am excited to see all that our people will accomplish and the difference they will make for their clients for their community and for each other.”

McLean Virginia-based Booz Allen acquired Liberty in June 2021 in a $725 million deal. Liberty was based in Herndon Virginia and its Melbourne facility was one of its largest operations.

At the time of the acquisition Booz Allen estimated that Liberty initially would contribute $300 million to $340 million a year to the combined company's revenue.

Liberty was founded in 2013 and had about 600 solution architects engineers and other technical employers at the time of the Booz Allen acquisition including about 200 in Melbourne.

Since then the Melbourne staff has grown to more than 300 according to Booz Allen Senior Vice President Mark Merz who previously was chief operating officer at Liberty.

""The VA operates the largest electronic health care record system in the world"" Merz said. ""They have 22 million patients within their electronic health care system. There's many different software packages that comprise a VA health care system. We focus primarily on the health side supporting various health care applications that clinicians would use when they are providing care for veterans.""

Merz said about 95% of the company's local staff works on VA health care projects.

Among its projects not directly involving VA patients was one allow the VA to better track COVID-19 vaccination records for its volunteers and employees.

While Booz Allen's Melbourne staffing levels will depend on future contract wins Merz said it's possible for the company to add another 100 to 150 people to its staff over the next 12 months to support its current projects.

""These are high-tech jobs for software engineering technologists software architects business analysts project managers — those types of positions"" Merz said. ""These are not low-level-type positions.""

Booz Allen's local staff growth was driven in part by the need to support two large contracts received in the past year.

“Both contracts combined offer us a minimum $1.7 billion ceiling with tremendous growth potential for our presence in the area” said Travis Mashburn a Melbourne-based principal with Booz Allen.

Merz said as Booz Allen's local operation works on its existing contracts it also is ""aggressively pursuing"" new contracts not only inside the Department of Veterans Affairs but also in ""adjacent markets.""

The Agile Center of Excellence derives its name from a category of software development.

""Agile is a method for developing software where you can iterate very quickly and provide functionality to your customer much more quickly as opposed to a long waterfall-type schedule"" Merz said. ""In some cases we develop software and deploy it daily which is unheard of from what we used to do five or 10 years ago even.""

Recruitment efforts

Merz said recruiting staff can be a challenge with Brevard County's low unemployment rate and the competition for high-tech workers but Booz Allen is well-positioned to meet its hiring goals.

""It's hard but I think by recruiting well early and upfront it makes your job a lot easier when you get to a time like we're in today where it is a little bit more challenging to hire"" Merz said.

Merz said at a time when recruiting staff is difficult in all industries ""what I found is that if you work on the right things and do so in the right way that you're going to attract the right people. And if you get those right people you're going to execute projects really really well.""

Merz said the company ""set out from the very beginning to be a true technology company. And we stayed very true to that. And I'm very proud of what we've built. And what I've found is that if you recruit really really well you start to see a snowball effect where good people tend to know really good people and want them to work alongside them. And it just exponentially starts to compound and next thing you know you've got these 300 people. These are really really good technology folks that we're really really proud to work with.""

Merz said he has had good luck recruiting at his alma mater Melbourne's Florida Institute of Technology where he received bachelor's and master's degrees and was an all-conference shortstop on Florida Tech's baseball team.

""So going back to my alma mater to recruit which I've been doing since 2013 gives me great pleasure"" Merz said. ""We've really really enjoyed recruiting Florida Tech students. We've got a great relationship with the university.""

Upgraded facilities

Booz Allen has made major upgrades to its 40000-square-foot Melbourne facility’s information technology infrastructure. That includes installing more expansive and reliable Wi-Fi and adding new video teleconferencing technology in conference rooms.

Merz said even with the staff expansion he does not believe expanding facilities is necessary at least for the time being because many staff members work in a hybrid model since the COVID-19 pandemic began splitting time between the office and working remotely.

Merz was one of the first hires when Liberty was started in 2013 after working for 15½ years at Melbourne-based Harris Corp. now L3Harris Technologies Inc.

""I've been a part of the company since 2013"" Merz said. ""I've been a part of some amazing growth leading up to the acquisition. And having a company like Booz Allen with the reputation that they have on a global level to have a company like that on the Space Coast is really good news for all residents in Brevard County.""

He said Booz Allen — a Fortune 500 company with 29300 employees worldwide — acquiring Liberty was a key development for the local high-tech sector.

""When you look around the area and you see companies like L3Harris Boeing SpaceX Raytheon on and on and on — and now to have a company at the same stature and level as those folks — it's a big deal for the area"" Merz said. ""This is another company that is going to provide opportunities for new employees and tremendous opportunities for its current employees.""

Merz said Booz Allen is committed to its Melbourne operations for a number of reasons.

""Booz Allen's all-in"" on the Space Coast Merz said. ""They've made some major renovations to our building and then made investments in our employees and are well-positioned for growth in this area.""

Merz said the Space Coast remains a ""fairly low-cost"" area compared with other high-tech regions and has ""some amazing talent.""

""When you're working on mission-critical projects like what we're working on for the VA people care about the job that they're working on and it's really easy to get motivated to work on projects like this"" Merz said. ""And then to work alongside some of the talent that we have. You don't see that happen often in a technology job where you're working with something so cool and then get to work alongside people who are extremely brilliant.""

Merz said he looks forward ""to seeing how much more we can grow here in the next couple of years. And the employees that are at Liberty the amount of opportunities that are going now be in front of those folks is really exciting for me. I've hired a lot of these folks. Personally I've known a lot of these people for a long time. It's just exciting to see this next step in our in our business growth and it's going to be a fun ride here. It's an exciting time for all of us.""

Using two different business jets respectively owned and operated by Leidos and L3Harris the Army is informing future requirements for its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) to replace the Guardrail. Right now Leidos’ ARTEMIS jet is flying in Europe and L3Harris’ ARES aircraft has flown in the Pacific

“It’s a totally different type of CONOP [concept of operations] than from what we would do with a Guardrail” Ronald Rizzo deputy project director for sensors aerial intelligence at Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors told reporters during a media day last week. “Going back to the Cold War days it lived in Germany and we fly along the German border. That was that was the extent of its range.”

With ARTEMIS and ARES “we’re able to launch from one area and very quickly get to another area that is much further away in distance. So it opens up the aperture from a mission perspective” Rizzo said.

The ARTEMIS aircraft has demonstrated its range during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flying multiple sorties per week both before and after the conflict began. ARTEMIS takes off from Romania and consistently flies through Slovakia and Hungary — along the Ukraine border — and continues through Poland towards Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. The aircraft also completes routes inside Romania scanning along Romania’s border with Ukraine and Moldova. Recent flights show the aircraft flying for over nine hours and up to almost 4000 miles.

The ARTEMIS aircraft returns to the United States every few weeks Rizzo said where the Army updates the software on board.

“We iterate on software we iterate on different sensors hardware and back out it goes” Rizzo said.

L3Harris has a similar mission in the Pacific. The plane arrived in the region in April and had flown 130 hours according to an early June report from Defense News. According to that report ARES is a larger platform than ARTEMIS with a higher altitude and longer range allowing for more powerful ISR payloads.

“All of this is to inform how we will ultimately build the HADES program of record” Rizzo said.

Another consideration for the Army is how it will sustain a business-class jet in its arsenal. Under the two prototypes the contractors are responsible for the sustainment but the Army is receiving reports and feedback Rizzo said.

“That is something that we are looking at for how to tackle it into the program of record” Rizzo said. “We still need to crack the nut on how we’re going to as an Army maintain a business-class jet. That’s being worked.”

This year ARES is expected to participate in Project Convergence but ARTEMIS will not. At last year’s Project Convergence ARTEMIS pulled out during the exercise to fly back to Europe as tensions rose on the Russia-Ukraine border. The aircraft also participated in EDGE 21 last year the annual future vertical lift networking exercise in Utah.

While ARTEMIS and ARES are still flying as testbed aircraft for HADES the Army released a request for information late last month for three HADES prototypes. Under that RFI the Army laid out two courses for action for the HADES program. Under the first option the contractor would receive an aircraft that’s already modified to carry sensors and radar. For the second option the contractor would receive a jet right off the production line and have to modify the airframe for radar and sensors integration.

The Army plans to field HADES in 2028 and is looking at buying between 10 to 16 of the jets Rizzo said but the number hasn’t been finalized. According to fiscal 2023 budget books HADES prototype acquisition and integration will begin in the second quarter of FY23. Qualification testing and evaluation will start in FY24 and a military user assessment begins in FY26."

In place of empty streets thousands of jersey-clad fans and workers filled the Strip hitting the Bellagio and Caesars Palace. The 2022 NFL Draft was an announcement that Vegas was back and it also served as proof that the city could handle a large-scale event for America’s biggest sports league.

“I talked to Roger Goodell three or four times since the draft and he was just astounded at how well it came off” Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said in a sitdown interview with The Athletic in May. “He goes ‘It was better than perfect.'”

Once all but taboo in the world of sports Sin City is now the home of the Golden Knights Aces and Raiders one of the NFL’s most iconic franchises. Vegas will host the Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium in 2024 an idea that once seemed nearly impossible for a city that was a pro sports backwater not that long ago.

“I moved here in 1985 and honestly I never thought that there would be any pro sports here in Las Vegas” said Jeff Stoneback director of sportsbook trading operations for MGM Resorts International.

But through decades of business deals bureaucracy and changes in public perception Vegas has transformed from a barren wasteland into a sprawling metropolis in the world of sports. And it’s not done growing just yet.

In 1984 then-Utah Jazz owner Sam Battistone considered relocating the team to Las Vegas so he planned a split home schedule with a handful of games at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center.

There was a catch. The NBA wanted the sportsbooks to take Jazz games off the board when they were in town. The sportsbooks pushed back. Once it became clear the NBA wouldn’t come otherwise they relented.

“The sports betting community got together and universally said ‘OK we’ll do this as a favor. We don’t like it. We don’t think it’s right. But to get the Jazz here we’ll take the games off the board'” said 8NewsNow anchor Ron Futrell who has covered sports in the city since 1984.

“But I also got the impression that it was Never again too by the sports betting community: No we’re not going to acquiesce. And of course they never did again.”

Outside of hosting Game 4 of the Lakers and Blazers’ first-round series following the 1992 L.A. riots the NBA lacked a significant presence in Vegas until the inaugural NBA Summer League in 2004. Former mayor Oscar Goodman pushed to get the 2007 NBA All-Star Game in Vegas but the weekend went poorly with over 400 people arrested. The Summer League remained but it was clear that would be it.

The NBA’s posture illustrated a broader trend: Major pro sports leagues would flirt with Vegas but they weren’t willing to commit.

Still the flirtations were instrumental to the eventual breakthrough. In 1997 the NHL launched an annual preseason contest dubbed “Frozen Fury” between the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche at MGM Grand Garden Arena. The event regularly sold out and brought an influx of tourists to the city — along with significant sponsorship dollars — and ultimately evolved into a week-long affair.

“And all of the sudden we were kind of looking around going ‘My God the number of people that want to come in from Southern California and spend a three or four-day weekend to go to a preseason hockey game'” said Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke who helped run Frozen Fury as president of the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). “What does that tell you about Vegas?

“This isn’t about the two or three million people that live there: It’s about the 50 million people that come there.”

It wasn’t exactly a novel idea. Late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson and current CEO Rob Goldstein for example raked in money by building convention and exhibition spaces. Combined with the city’s existing hotel rooms and seemingly endless entertainment options it made Vegas the go-to place for such events. Through the tourism that followed conventions would dominate the city.

Major players in the sports business world began to come around on Las Vegas as a legitimate market. And they became more optimistic about the ability to construct state-of-the-art facilities.

In 2007 Leiweke and AEG entered a partnership with Harrah’s Entertainment to build a 20000-seat arena with plans to break ground in 2008. That deal never came to fruition thanks in large part to bureaucratic gridlock but in 2012 AEG formed a new partnership with MGM Resorts International which had come up with a project that would rely solely on private funding for the $375 million in estimated construction costs. The partnership announced the plan in 2013 and in 2014 began construction on what would ultimately be dubbed T-Mobile Arena built to meet both NHL and NBA specifications.

“There was always a lot of momentum and chatter there. I think the fact that we along with our partners at AEG made the leap to go ahead and build a state-of-the-art venue helped” said Dan Quinn VP of entertainment for MGM Resorts International and general manager of T-Mobile Arena. “Had another team wanted to either relocate here or talk about adding an expansion team here the natural question would’ve been ‘Well where are they gonna play?'”

The arena solved that problem. Both AEG and MGM Resorts were confident that it would be profitable off of concerts boxing matches UFC events and conventions alone but as Leiweke pointed out when it came to sports franchises the venue was built on the concept of “If you build it they will come.”

Now Vegas just needed one to bite.

The NHL had already been nibbling. With a two-decade-long presence in Vegas thanks to Frozen Fury the league had conversations with businessmen Bill Foley and George Maloof about leading a potential ownership group for an expansion team after construction began. Still longtime NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was skeptical.

“He couldn’t believe that we’d be able to sell that many tickets in the desert for hockey” said Sisolak.

The NHL gave Foley the green light to hold a season ticket drive in December 2014 with a goal of 10000 deposits. That mark was hit by April 2015 quelling Bettman’s doubts. In June 2016 two months after T-Mobile Arena opened Foley’s bid was approved by a unanimous vote of NHL owners.

Major professional sports was in Vegas for the first time — but an even more massive shift was underway.

In July 2015 then-Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval created a committee to explore what it would take to construct a 65000-seat stadium big enough to lure a potential NFL franchise. The same month T-Mobile Arena opened the Raiders sat down with Las Vegas representatives at one of the committee meetings to discuss their possible relocation from Oakland.

The biggest question was how the stadium would be funded. Raiders owner Mark Davis said he would contribute $500 million toward the projected $1.84 billion cost and Adelson — who at the time of his death in January 2021 had a net worth of around $40 billion — was on board to make a $650 million contribution of his own but the project would still need significant public money. In September 2016 the committee approved a plan with $750 million funded by a hotel room tax increase.

“The big thing to get the community involved was the jobs” said Sisolak who worked in the Clark County Commission at the time. “We were coming out of a tough time — jobs were in short supply — and this was a lot of both construction and permanent jobs.”

Opponents argued that the money raised through the room tax increase would be better off used on public and social needs according to LVSportzBiz founder Alan Snel who covered the debate.

“This whole streak of stadium and arena construction (happened) against the backdrop of a market that literally is at the bottom of the country in terms of primary care doctors per capita surgeons per capita health and medical resources and … education and teachers” Snel said. “Las Vegas for so many years held back from subsidizing and backing sports with public money and now it’s completely both feet in the pool.”

After passing through the committee the plan needed to make it through the Nevada Legislature. It did but not without controversy — one Republican lawmaker called the proceedings a “disgrace” and “​​stacked deck” after the bill was voted on in the 42-seat state Assembly without first being debated.

Three months later the Raiders officially filed relocation paperwork with the NFL.

“The NFL was the 900-pound gorilla” Snel said. “And it definitely made Las Vegas big-time overnight.”

The city was still reeling in response to the deadliest mass shooting in American history when the Golden Knights began their inaugural season. On Oct. 1 2017 a gunman had opened fire on a crowd of people at a music festival from a room at the Mandalay Bay hotel killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more.

Nine days later after honoring victims and first responders the Golden Knights took to the ice at T-Mobile Arena amid banners featuring the hashtag #VegasStrong.

“The community just latched on to them” Sisolak said. “They were very active in the community. They were out in the schools and working with all the civic organizations. They really had a big presence here.”

One week later the NBA and WNBA approved the sale of the San Antonio Stars to MGM Resorts which relocated the team to Vegas and renamed it the Aces. In just 16 months three major sports franchises had elected to make the city their new home.

And as it became clear that the Golden Knights were pretty damn good — they went 51-24-7 on their way to a Stanley Cup Final appearance — Vegas took to sports in a way it hadn’t since the days of the high-flying UNLV men’s basketball teams under Jerry Tarkanian.

“There was tremendous pride here when the Runnin’ Rebels won the national championship. This town was lit up. It was electric. You could feel it” Futrell the 8NewsNow anchor said. “I don’t feel like it came back until the first season of the Vegas Golden Knights.”

The official capacity for hockey games at T-Mobile Arena is 17500 but the average attendance for the first season was 18042. The city had grown something organically and latched onto it as theirs.

“I think it had a profound influence on everyday residents literally buying into their first sports team franchise” Snel said. The Golden Knights “were wildly successful.”

As recently as 2016 the NFL NBA and MLB had come together to oppose challenges to the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) which outlawed sports betting nationwide excluding a few states. They were worried about the integrity of the game but the counter from Nevada was that its gaming industry was as well regulated as anywhere else. The Raiders referenced a 2015 study by UNLV international gaming institute executive director Bo Bernhard in their relocation proposal to the NFL.

“Because the regulation of the gambling is so strict and so severe here it’s one of the safest places to do it” former Raiders president Marc Badain said. “It was compelling to us and it was compelling to folks in the NFL. I think that played a big part in changing some people’s archaic beliefs and what was the tie between sports wagering and the sports teams themselves.”

The NFL agreed and on March 27 2017 approved the Raiders’ relocation bid. With the league on board Vegas had officially been stamped as a major sports market. “It’s the entertainment capital of the world” Badain said. “And it’s becoming the sports and entertainment capital of the world.”

With the Aces playing their inaugural season and the Golden Knights going into Year 2 as well as the expansion USL Championship’s Lights FC the Triple-A Las Vegas Aviators UFC and boxing the city continued to make strides as a sports destination in 2018. But the most significant development that year came when the U.S. Supreme Court voted to strike down PASPA that May which opened the door for legalizing gambling nationally.

The same sports leagues that were so strongly opposed to the proliferation of gambling a couple of years prior began to explore ways to profit from it.

“When (PASPA) got repealed everybody wanted to cash in on it” said Stoneback the director of sportsbook trading operations for MGM Resorts International. Through fantasy leagues and sponsorship deals with sportsbooks leagues and teams became directly involved in the industry. And with the influx of media coverage more people started to participate.

“It’s become much more mainstream” Stoneback said. “I remember when PASPA got repealed people were like ‘Boy that’s gonna hurt you guys in Nevada’ but it’s only increased our wagering.”

That increase gave the local economy another lift that carried through 2019 but growth came to a halt in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic brought the entire world to a halt. The NFL had planned for Vegas to host the draft that April ahead of the Raiders’ first season in the city but was forced to postpone. And while the NFL season would be played Mark Davis opted against allowing fans to attend games at Allegiant Stadium. The Raiders’ introduction to Vegas was put on hold.

The Raiders were able to survive losing a season’s worth of ticket sales but many others in an economy driven by tourism and hospitality weren’t so lucky. By April 2020 the city’s unemployment rate had spiked to 30 percent. And while that number came down there was still a concerning trend: From November 2019 to November 2020 unemployment in Vegas jumped from 3.6 percent to 11.5 percent. Entering 2021 the city needed a bounce back in a major way.

The recovery was gradual. In March the Golden Knights became the first local sports team to let spectators back into the arena; they were at full capacity by June. The Aces allowed fans back in May and that August the NFL officially made its debut in front of fans when the Raiders held a scrimmage at Allegiant Stadium in front of about 20000 people. The vision for the evolution of Vegas into a sports hub was finally coming together.

Across nine home games that season the Raiders’ average attendance of 61185 ranked just 26th in the league but they brought in a league-leading $119 million in net ticket revenue according to Sportico. That money didn’t directly funnel into the Vegas economy but it still had an impact through tourist spending and stadium employment.

“It made a difference in the recovery of the city from the pandemic” Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO/president Steve Hill said. “The stadium has performed about twice as well as we would’ve expected from a tourism and economic standpoint. … It is just going to continue to grow this market.”

During the Raiders’ first season the NFL announced that Vegas would host the Pro Bowl the following February the NFL Draft months after that and the Super Bowl in 2024 which will make it the first city to host all three events. The league bestowing its approval has seemingly opened up the door for other high-profile suitors such as Formula 1 which will come to Vegas in 2023 for the first time since the 1980s.

But the NFL’s introduction to Vegas wasn’t all positivity. Head coach Jon Gruden was forced to resign in October after his racist misogynistic and homophobic emails were uncovered during the league’s workplace misconduct investigation into the now-Washington Commanders. And a string of issues raised concerns about the potential dangers of having a franchise in Sin City.

On Nov. 2 2021 second-year receiver Henry Ruggs III the 12th pick in the 2020 draft was involved in a car crash that killed 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her dog. Las Vegas police later revealed that Ruggs was driving at excessive speeds on a residential road — 120 miles per hour at the time of the crash — and that his blood alcohol content was more than twice the legal limit hours after the crash. Ruggs was released by the Raiders and charged with multiple felonies including DUI resulting in death. He is currently awaiting trial.

Less than a week later the team released cornerback Damon Arnette after a video of him brandishing weapons and making threats to an unidentified individual emerged on social media. Just over two months later Arnette was arrested in Vegas on charges of assault with a deadly weapon carrying a concealed weapon without a permit and drug possession.

The consecutive nature of the events led to some hypothesizing about whether living in Vegas made it more likely for athletes to get into trouble and as the Ruggs case showed potentially harm civilians living in the community.

The data is a mixed bag. Vegas has a higher crime rate than most cities in the United States but it lines up pretty similarly compared to other major cities. And while it may not pose greater dangers than cities such as Los Angeles New York or Miami Vegas still stands out from the pack in certain areas. For example BuyAutoInsurance.com ranked it as the most dangerous city in the country for drunk driving with an average of 4311 DUI arrests per year.

“I think there’s a public perception with that but there’s obviously been some problems with some of the young players” Sisolak said. “And I think sometimes what we fail to realize especially people my age is these are kids …

“Yeah there’s a lot of opportunities but every town has opportunities. I think it’s dependent on the coaching and the management to make sure that they make them aware of what those pitfalls could possibly be.”

Badain worked within the Raiders organization for over 30 years before abruptly resigning last year. (Mark Davis revealed a few months later that Badain’s and former Raiders CFO Ed Villanueva’s exits were forced due to “accounting irregularities” that started back when the team was in Oakland.)

While he still worked for the Raiders Badain met Leiweke in the early 2000s and they reconnected through the Adelson family who hired Leiweke as an advisor when the Raiders began to discuss collaborating on a relocation to Vegas. The Adelsons ultimately backed out but Badain and Leiweke stayed in touch. Toward the end of 2021 Leiweke posed a question.

“What if we built the best arena in the business?”

Leiweke had been mulling over the idea for years. He’d seen T-Mobile bring the NHL to Vegas and now he wanted to do the same thing with the NBA. The home of the Golden Knights was built for NBA specifications but Leiweke and Oak View Group (OVG) didn’t want to take a chance that a prospective franchise might not want to share T-Mobile. In their minds bringing the NBA to the city would require yet another arena.

“There’s a lot of people that I know of that want to buy an NBA franchise if one becomes available in Las Vegas” Leiweke said. “We have one or two groups we may be working with and I’m convinced there will be people that will step up if the NBA decides to expand and chase a franchise. But what they need is the certainty of an arena. You can’t have a question mark.”

In partnership with Badain and led by Leiweke OVG announced last March that it planned to erase that question mark with plans to build a $3 billion sports and entertainment center — including a $1 billion 20000-seat arena — near The Strip. The complex which will break ground in 2023 and is set to be completed in 2026 will also include an amphitheater hotel and casino.

Like Leiweke’s first arena project in the city — and other projects of his throughout the country — the new arena is being constructed before landing a commitment from a franchise. It seems risky but those behind the project similarly believe the complex can sustain itself through live entertainment and events. They know they can’t assume the NBA will come.

“There are no guarantees the NBA is coming and that’s been made very clear” Leiweke said. “So what you gotta do is go build (the arena) and make it work on everything else. My guess is they’ll get more interested and fascinated by Vegas if there is a world-class billion-dollar arena.”

The hope is that the arena will at very least house the Summer League preseason games and NCAA basketball games and tournaments. The MSG Sphere at The Venetian a 17500-seat auditorium scheduled to open in 2023 will be competition for music and entertainment events so Oak View views it as instrumental for their arena to have some sort of sports element.

“The goal and Tim has done it before is to build a venue that’s ready for these tenants to program it with strategic partners that he’s already done business with in the past and to build the next arena for Las Vegas” Badain said. “It’s time.”

Leiweke has taken a similar approach in other cities. He helped build the Sprint Center in Kansas City in 2007 with hopes of landing an NBA or NHL franchise though none came. But OVG’s $1.15 billion redevelopment of Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena — formerly KeyArena — is already home to the NHL’s Kraken and is the most logical landing spot if an NBA franchise were to return to the city.

“The day (the NBA) makes a decision they can turn around and start playing up there tomorrow” Leiweke said. “It’s wise for us to do that in Vegas as well. It does not mean we’re gonna get one but it does put us in a better position in case they decide to expand.”

Late NBA commissioner David Stern made annual visits to Vegas for Summer League and current commissioner Adam Silver has followed suit. Sisolak who assumed office as Nevada governor in 2019 has been having conversations with NBA leadership over the last decade. He can’t be certain but he’s optimistic about the league coming to the city.

“I talked to Roger Goodell three or four times since the draft and he was just astounded at how well it came off” said Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. (Jeff Speer / Getty Images)

A much more immediate development is the potential relocation of MLB’s Oakland A’s whose lease at the Oakland Coliseum is set to expire following the 2024 season. The club has threatened to relocate if Oakland doesn’t approve plans to build a new stadium.

The Aviators have been their Triple-A affiliate since 2019 and Sisolak has been in active conversations with A’s owner John Fisher. The club has explored parcels of land in Vegas and could theoretically play at the Aviators’ Las Vegas Ballpark while a new stadium was being built.

“I think they gotta pull the trigger and say ‘Look we’re gonna move or not move'” Sisolak said. “The town is ready for them.”

The tricky part? Like their former Oakland neighbors the A’s would be aiming for a public contribution toward building a new stadium. Considering the city just committed $750 million to do the same for the Raiders it could be difficult to get that legislation to pass.

“I know everyone is kind of gung-ho about the baseball and the Oakland Athletics; I’m not really drinking the Kool-Aid until there’s like a public-funding source for a baseball park” Snel the LVSportzBiz founder said. “If there is a sizable public subsidy for a baseball park then I think the Oakland Athletics would have a crack at the Las Vegas market.”

Major League Soccer is another league in the mix. It’s aiming to add a 30th team through expansion and commissioner Don Garber called Vegas the “frontrunner” to land that prospective franchise last December. And while an independent soccer stadium would need to be constructed — Cashman Field home to Lights FC won’t cut it — the MLS has held multiple matches at Allegiant Stadium the last couple of years.

It seems clear it’s a matter of when not if more leagues are coming to Vegas. The city has arrived as a national — and international — sports hub. The only question that remains is how big it can get.

“These are the early years” Leiweke said. “I don’t think we’re at the end of this cycle; I think we’re at the beginning.”

Not only will the Las Vegas Strip section of the Las Vegas Grand Prix road circuit be rebuilt for the race the entire 3.8-mile route will be rebuilt for the F1 road race set for Las Vegas in November 2023.

This is no repaving job. The rebuild of the 14-turn road circuit will involve work crews digging a foot deep and rebuilding the entire length of the route said Steve Hill chief executive officer and president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA).

Hill expects the road construction to start in April or some time in the second quarter of 2023.

The route will be a counter-clockwise circuit and include other roads like Koval Lane Sands Avenue and Harmon Avenue. There will be a 1.2-mile section on the Strip a southbound stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard. Here’s a look at the route:

In May the LVCVA tourism agency approved a $19.5 million deal with F1 for three years.

Using two different business jets respectively owned and operated by Leidos and L3Harris the Army is informing future requirements for its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) to replace the Guardrail. Right now Leidos’ ARTEMIS jet is flying in Europe and L3Harris’ ARES aircraft has flown in the Pacific

“It’s a totally different type of CONOP [concept of operations] than from what we would do with a Guardrail” Ronald Rizzo deputy project director for sensors aerial intelligence at Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors told reporters during a media day last week. “Going back to the Cold War days it lived in Germany and we fly along the German border. That was that was the extent of its range.”

With ARTEMIS and ARES “we’re able to launch from one area and very quickly get to another area that is much further away in distance. So it opens up the aperture from a mission perspective” Rizzo said.

The ARTEMIS aircraft has demonstrated its range during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flying multiple sorties per week both before and after the conflict began. ARTEMIS takes off from Romania and consistently flies through Slovakia and Hungary — along the Ukraine border — and continues through Poland towards Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. The aircraft also completes routes inside Romania scanning along Romania’s border with Ukraine and Moldova. Recent flights show the aircraft flying for over nine hours and up to almost 4000 miles.

The ARTEMIS aircraft returns to the United States every few weeks Rizzo said where the Army updates the software on board.

“We iterate on software we iterate on different sensors hardware and back out it goes” Rizzo said.

L3Harris has a similar mission in the Pacific. The plane arrived in the region in April and had flown 130 hours according to an early June report from Defense News. According to that report ARES is a larger platform than ARTEMIS with a higher altitude and longer range allowing for more powerful ISR payloads.

“All of this is to inform how we will ultimately build the HADES program of record” Rizzo said.

Another consideration for the Army is how it will sustain a business-class jet in its arsenal. Under the two prototypes the contractors are responsible for the sustainment but the Army is receiving reports and feedback Rizzo said.

“That is something that we are looking at for how to tackle it into the program of record” Rizzo said. “We still need to crack the nut on how we’re going to as an Army maintain a business-class jet. That’s being worked.”

This year ARES is expected to participate in Project Convergence but ARTEMIS will not. At last year’s Project Convergence ARTEMIS pulled out during the exercise to fly back to Europe as tensions rose on the Russia-Ukraine border. The aircraft also participated in EDGE 21 last year the annual future vertical lift networking exercise in Utah.

While ARTEMIS and ARES are still flying as testbed aircraft for HADES the Army released a request for information late last month for three HADES prototypes. Under that RFI the Army laid out two courses for action for the HADES program. Under the first option the contractor would receive an aircraft that’s already modified to carry sensors and radar. For the second option the contractor would receive a jet right off the production line and have to modify the airframe for radar and sensors integration.

The Army plans to field HADES in 2028 and is looking at buying between 10 to 16 of the jets Rizzo said but the number hasn’t been finalized. According to fiscal 2023 budget books HADES prototype acquisition and integration will begin in the second quarter of FY23. Qualification testing and evaluation will start in FY24 and a military user assessment begins in FY26.",,,,,,,,,

For compound living and multigenerational clans.

These days many families are making a lifestyle change that sounds like The Brady Bunch meets The Golden Girls. Grandparents parents and their kids are moving in together. An estimated one in four Americans now lives in a multigenerational household according to Generations United a Washington D.C. nonprofit.

You can chalk it up to the pandemic when families were driven bananas by isolation remote work homeschooling and lack of child care. But Alan Jones Arizona division president of Lennar homebuilders anticipated this trend in 2012 when he pioneered Next Gen Homes. These semi-divided dwellings have a one- or two-bedroom suite with its own entrance kitchen bathroom washer-dryer side yard and – often – garage. The chic airy suites can serve as a classroom for homeschooling an office a gym or a home for gran and gramps. “This provides for great interaction between grandparents and grandchildren and it also provides an opportunity for people to take care of their aging parents” Jones says.

Next Gen homes are available in Lennar neighborhoods Valleywide but one of the most popular is Zanjero Trails near the 303 freeway in Surprise.

Live Nation Entertainment has made a move to reduce that waste at its venues and festival via a strategic investment in Turn Systems which operates a leading reusable-cup system that also includes collection bins and mobile washing systems. According to the announcement a single reusable Turn cup has the potential to displace up to 100 single-use cups and can break even on its environmental impact in as few as three uses. (For more on Turn Systems see the company’s website.)

As the primary option for beverages at participating Live Nation events fans can easily use the return-bin system instead of a traditional trash or recycling bin. Similar systems have been successfully deployed at major European festivals for many years.

Popular on Variety

According to the announcement it is “another step in the company’s goal to eliminate single-use plastics and work toward zero-waste concerts.”

Live Nation successfully deployed the Turn system at several recent events according to the announcement. At the Innings Festival in February the reusable Turn cups were used in place of single-use plastic cups and fans returned 86% of them. As part of the Turn pilot program at PNC Music Pavilion in Charlotte NC the venue avoided the use of 13000 single-use cups with fans returning 90% of the cups. Turn systems use software that allows customers to calculate their reuse impact seeing the difference that simply using a non-disposable cup can make. According to a recent study by Live Nation 82% of concert-goers say they strive to maintain an environmentally sustainable lifestyle.

According to the announcement Live Nation will be rolling out Turn Systems across select festivals and venues this year projecting to displace more than 1 million single-use cups this year. In recent months the company also has partnered with Liquid Death canned water to avoid the usage of over 5 million plastic bottles last year with fans encouraged to refill at free water refill stations located throughout venues. Additionally at Live Nation venues food and beverage items are currently served in compostable and recyclable packaging and dedicated sustainability teams at each venue sort through all waste which is then donated recycled and/or composted at local facilities.

Artists playing at Live Nation venues featuring the Turn program have voiced their support for the initiative. Jack Johnson a leader in promoting green touring says “I’m excited to see Live Nation taking their commitment to reduce plastic pollution to the next level by launching reusable cup programs at some of their concert venues this summer. It’s inspiring to see a music industry effort to offer alternatives to single-use plastic and to give music fans the option to choose reusables.”

5 Seconds of Summer added “We are stoked to partner with Live Nation to promote a more sustainable touring environment where our fans will leave behind a smaller footprint across several venues this summer and for many more to come. Reusable materials can be a wholly more sustainable and enjoyable experience and we hope to see this innovative program rolled out in more venues soon.”

Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino said “By investing in Turn Live Nation is able to make events at our venues and festivals more sustainable. By rolling out real world solutions at scale we hope this helps the whole industry find solutions.”

Ryan Everton Founder and CEO of Turn Systems added: “To mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis we need to take meaningful steps to reduce carbon emissions divert waste from landfills and oceans and create circular economies at scale. We are thrilled to partner with Live Nation to move the needle forward in achieving these ambitions. By deploying Turn across Live Nation’s extensive reach we hope to not only reduce the environmental impact of these events but also to inspire others to take climate action at their own events and in their daily lives.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5wb2xsc3Rhci5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNi90aGUtMy1wZXJjZW50ZXJzLWhvdy1saXZlLW5hdGlvbi1oaXJlZC01MC1pbnRlcm5zLWZyb20tYS1wb29sLW9mLTE1MDAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Live Nation Hired 50 Interns From A Pool Of 15000,"How Live Nation Hired 50 Interns From A Pool Of 15000

Internships can be an invaluable experience. Here a young person can gain hands-on experience showcase their skills work ethic and shiny personality meet potential mentors find pathways into an industry and potentially change the rest of their lives.

The hardest part however may just be landing one. In fact the odds of landing a summer internship this year in the U.S. Concerts division of Live Nation the world’s largest music promoter may not have been exactly in your favor. To wit 2022’s crop of 50 paid interns came from a pool of 15000(!) – imagine sorting through those resumes – with just .3% of the applicants making it to the other side. (That’s actually less than Harvard’s 3.19% accepted for the class of 2026.)

As part of the company’s efforts to continue creating more equitable opportunities and building more diverse team this was also the first year that Live Nation’s Concerts announced it was shifting to a paid internship program which likely upped the amount of applicants.

Pollstar reached out to Aisha Collins Senior HR Director for Live Nation’s Concerts and Touring division for the NextGen issue to find out how the process went.

Pollstar: First tell us about your background?

Aisha Collins: I started with Live Nation in November 2021. Prior to joining Live Nation I worked in the hospitality industry for 18 years16 of which have been specifically in Human Resources.



How does the Live Nation internship work – where do they work how long it goes for what does it entail?

For Live Nation’s U.S. Concerts summer internship we wanted to create a program that was interactive educational and left the interns with the tools and resources to continue on with their education or to kickstart their career in live entertainment.

The program was developed with Live Nation’s diversity initiatives and students in mind. Many of us had to work through the summer when we were students and therefore missed out on career-building opportunities when internships were unpaid and only offered school credit. By creating a paid internship program we have opened the door for more diverse students from various universities to receive industry experience that perhaps would not have been considered an option in the past. We developed this program with them in mind and hope to continue to build upon it every year.

Our Summer Internship provides a paid 12–16-week program that includes hands-on experience in many aspects of bringing concerts to life on several teams from marketing finance booking operations social media brand management and many more.



What was the criteria for applicants in order to apply?

Our requirements were that participants had to be a junior/senior in college grad student or recent graduate of 2020/2021 (since many students couldn’t participate in internships during that time).



What were the numbers on the applicants vs. the spots available for this year’s LN intern program?

We had a total of 50 internship slots available and received more than 15000 applicants. It’s incredible to see just how many people are interested in working in live entertainment.

What kinds of experiences academics personality etc. were you looking for?

The live entertainment industry offers career paths for people from all walks of life with completely different backgrounds. Live entertainment-specific programs are rarely offered in school so we’re especially proud of this internship and the hands-on experience we provide.



Many in the industry come from a range of educational backgrounds that may not be music-related or include attending university which speaks to how important real-world experience is when establishing your career.

STEVE ACKLES

Global Tour Promoter

Live Nation Entertainment

Steve Ackles global tour promoter for Live Nation is practically a grizzled veteran of the business having initially learned the business of touring from the vantage point of a 15-passenger van as a 16-year-old guitarist in a local Boston band.

“My band never had a proper manager or booking agent so I found myself taking on that role for our group” Ackles says. “What started with a few cold calls to regional venues turned into putting together national tours for the group. We traveled across the country in a 15-passenger van making stops in as many cities as possible while sleeping in Walmart parking lots along the way.”

Ackles made many important relationships during that time which he was able to parlay into a 15-year career first at AEG Presents in New York City and now with Live Nation where he has spent four years and had a front row seat to many of the biggest tours and events in a particularly uncertain time.

“I’ve had the privilege of working with artists that I’ve looked up to and been a fan of for many years such as blink-182 and Green Day and have been fortunate to be a part of the growth of many of today’s biggest artists such as Halsey Machine Gun Kelly Megan Thee Stallion Lil Uzi Vert Rod Wave $uicideboy$ and Tate McRae” Ackles explains. “It’s been incredible to play a role in amplifying the reach of these artists on a global scale.”

In addition to bringing stars of the highest caliber to global stages Ackles hasn’t forgotten the excitement of bringing great concert experiences to fans.

“When I first began promoting shows at the club level I immediately became hooked by the positive experience I could create for fans by bringing their favorite artists to their respective towns” Ackles says. “That same energy sticks with me today and it’s a huge driver behind why I enjoy my job. I think it’s important to never forget where you came from and I’m grateful for the opportunity to help shape the careers of others along the way.”"

The first such capability the Terrestrial Layer System-Brigade Combat Team (TLS-BCT) is undergoing an important operational assessment that will be a critical step in moving out toward fielding.

TLS-BCT is the first brigade-organic integrated signals intelligence electronic warfare and cyber platform that will first be mounted on Strykers.

“We’re looking at September of 2023 as the mark on the wall for operational assessment. This is really going to be a trailblazing event for us” Maj. Derek Vanino assistant program manager for Terrestrial Spectrum Warfare within Program Executive Office for Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors told reporters during a visit to Aberdeen Proving Ground on Aug. 30. “We’re already working very closely with the test community having advanced discussions about our operational assessment and what that means for this acquisition decisions that are going to emanate from that from the operational assessment.”

Lockheed Martin was awarded a $58.8 million contract in July to pave the way for TLS-BCT to be delivered to soldiers in 2023.

The September operational assessment is a “steep runway” from the award last month in terms of getting everything aligned officals said. They expect to do a configuration on an actual vehicle in the June timeframe before transporting them to the test location.

This test won’t be the only place the Army will collect data informing the final acquisition push officials said pointing to a variety of additional demonstrations of the technology between now and the end of 2023.

Officials explained the main platform for TLS-BCT currently is a Stryker with plans to outfit other types of brigades such as armored and infantry. For armored units the Army is targeting the forthcoming Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) which is the replacement for the M113 family of vehicles though that effort is contingent on the ongoing experimentation with the Strykers.

“The AMPV’s direction is really — a lot of that’s going to be contingent on the Stryker because we’re really as we view it it’s a similar mission package” Vanino said. “The performance of the — of the Stryker at [operational assessments] is going to be a key driver also of the AMPV and a key driver of the timelines associated with that as well. That’s really how I’d message that is Stryker’s going to be the trailblazer then AMFV is going to follow.”

The Army does have funds to do some level of design and possible integration work for the AMPV in fiscal 2023.

Infantry units are a bit more tricky Vanino said with the Army waiting for further experimentation.

The priority for these units will be a manpack requirement for TLS-BCT that the Army is still developing. Soldiers will be able to take a backpack off the platform for dismounted operations.

“That’s an area where we’re continuing to look at what’s available in that form factor versus what the desirements are” Vanino said. “With manpack obviously it has the potential to become quite cumbersome get quite heavy and then you’re trading some of that mobility for capability. We’re rapidly scoping what the requirements of the end user are going to be with the manpack with an eye towards moving forward with a — with a solution for that.”

Officials noted that regarding the cyber capabilities those are more suited for the 915th Cyber Warfare Battalion and its expeditionary cyber teams.

These teams will augment brigades and lower formations conducting tactical cyber and electronic warfare operations by using specialized equipment that can plug into what the brigade already has.

“All platforms are being developed to have the ability to do an RF delivery of cyber effects” Willie Utroska deputy program manager for Electronic Warfare & Cyber at PEO IEW&S told reporters.

Deep sensing

In addition to the brigade system the Army is also working on the TLS-Echelons Above Brigade capability that will be designed for higher echelons that will need to monitor and sense the battlefield across greater distances than lower more tactically focused echelons.

A new start in fiscal 2022 the TLS-EAB program recently awarded two companies — Lockheed and General Dynamics Mission Systems — to do design work which includes software infrastructure and even vehicle design worth approximately $15 million over an 11-month period of performance.

For phase two one of the companies will receive an award for prototype development.

Officials have said that this version of the program will likely be less integrated than its brigade counterpart.

“The TLS-Echelon Above Brigade system which will provide similar capabilities for division corps and multi-domain task forces will also be fielded at echelon likely not as integrated based on the ranges and complexities but nonetheless we need those capabilities at all echelons” Lt. Gen. Laura Potter deputy chief of staff for intelligence G2 said at an event hosted by the Potomac Officers Club on Aug. 24.

This is likely given that the ranges covered for these echelons makes operations like electronic attack more difficult.

“When you get up into the theater level and the corps level those ranges perhaps it’s not as important to have as much effect for electronic attack” Maj. Joseph Fink assistant program manager for Terrestrial Spectrum Warfare managing the program at PEO IEW&S told reporters at Aberdeen. “Maybe it is maybe it’s not. We’re going to figure it out in phase one. It’s an exploratory phase for us we’re really going to use the industry partners and their creativity and existing proven capabilities that could be integrated [and] model understanding to find out what is realistic in the terrestrial” capability.

More power will be needed to affect those ranges from an electronic attack perspective and that will be something officials will assess if they need to.

“That’s the power of prototyping. We haven’t determined what the platform is going to be and platforms can differ between echelons” Utroska said. “We’ve decided what the BCT is going to — going to get but from a division corps and multi-domain task force the division may be more mobile than the corps … The power of prototyping is determining that mix. Is it a vehicle and a trailer? Is it one vehicle is it two vehicles? That’s what we’ll figure out in the next year of prototyping.”

While there are different signals of interest at these higher echelons and electronic attack might not be possible or even needed there officials said all these systems will work together as a family.

“When you look at what we have to get the threat not one system can do it all. You have to combine techniques a combined system. An example would be using the TLS-EAB in conjunction with an MFEW-Air Large” Utroska told reporters during a separate trip to Aberdeen Proving Ground in August citing the Army’s forthcoming aerial jamming pod.

Resourcing for these Terrestrial Layer Systems will come from electronic warfare platoons within brigades and electronic warfare companies at the division and corps level the Army is in the midst of building.

Currently the Army has stood up 15 electronic warfare platoons at the brigade level with 16 additional platoons remaining until full implementation by 2027 according to a spokesperson from the Cyber Center of Excellence. The EW companies at the corps and division level will be built in 2023 with corps completing by 2027 and divisions by 2029.

Additionally the Army has completed implementation of five Special Forces Group electronic warfare platoons and a Ranger Regiment cyber and electromagnetic activities company.

As set out in fiscal year 2023 (FY23) budget documents released earlier in 2022 the USN is seeking a hypersonic anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capability to be delivered under the OASuW Increment 2 programme – now known as the Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive (HALO) ASuW requirement.

HALO programme

Captain William Hargreaves the USN’s HALO programme director in Naval Air Systems Command’s (NAVAIR’s) Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) told Naval News on 12 August:

“HALO is envisioned to be a long-range aircraft carrier-based strike fighter aircraft-launched weapon system providing ASuW capabilities”

“OASuW Increment 2 will address advanced threats from engagement distances allowing the navy to operate in and control contested battlespace in littoral waters and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments” Capt Hargreaves added. Pointing particularly to the hypersonic requirement “The ability to engage targets in a timely manner is an important attribute to fleet stakeholders with significant increase in speed being a derived attribute” he continued.

The USN’s OASuW Increment 1 requirement to provide a long-range anti-ship missile (LRASM) capability is being met by the Lockheed Martin AGM-158C LRASM system. In April 2021 the USN completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) process to support procurement of additional OASuW capability.

The AoA requirement did not specify the need for hypersonic capability although the requirements to be met under Increment 2 have always been present within the USN’s OASuW threat perspective. “The [initial] solicitation was general in order to provide for inclusion of any technical solutions” Capt Hargreaves explained. “Increment 2 is expected to address threats from increased ranges [and] defenses that are more sophisticated.”

OASuW Increment 1 requirement to provide a long-range anti-ship missile (LRASM) capability is being met by the Lockheed Martin AGM-158C LRASM system (seen here during a 2019 test from a Super Hornet). NAVAIR picture.

“The HALO program continues to deliver OASuW kinetic capability albeit at increased range compared to Increment 1 and at a speed that affects the pace of battle. Hypersonic capabilities provide the ability to engage targets in a more timely manner relative to current long-range weapons. This is critical when attempting to affect the pace of battle. We must be able to mitigate the threat and do so in a timeframe that limits the enemy’s ability to react.”

Captain William Hargreaves HALO programme director at NAVAIR

The need for speed is reflected in HALO’s planned development schedule which is designed to deliver capability to the operator as fast as possible. “Initial deployment timeframes are a primary consideration as we finalize the acquisition strategy and prepare for execution in FY23” said Capt Hargreaves.

As regards taking forward the Increment 2 capability acquisition “We intend to focus initial development efforts for HALO on developing key technologies through the use of prototypes. Rapid maturation of key technologies supporting extended ranges and increased speeds will be key attributes of our initial prototyping efforts” said Capt Hargreaves. “The HALO program office is working closely with industry on determining those technologies available to meet requirements.” For the first steps he added “We are focusing HALO development on maturation of propulsion technologies with particular emphasis on aircraft carrier and F/A-18 Hornet aircraft integration.”"

The home improvement retailer cut her role and moved its marketing team under Bill Boltz executive vice president of merchandising. Thalberg previously reported directly to CEO Marvin Ellison.

Thalberg's departure is part of a growing wave of leadership changes in the retail industry. Gap GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond are among the other retailers who have lost C-suite executives. Such shakeups have gained steam as stimulus check-fueled spending wanes and some consumers pull back on discretionary purchases because of inflation. For some companies particularly major pandemic beneficiaries such as Peloton  it has meant a sudden and dramatic drop in sales.

Lowe's too has seen a slowdown. Its same-store sales have declined in the past two quarters. The company said it now expects total and comparable sales for the year toward the bottom of its outlook range. It had forecast sales of $97 billion to $99 billion and comparable sales to be down 1% to up 1%.

Thalberg stepped into the role in February 2020 a month before the pandemic began and fueled a surge of home improvement spending. She oversaw several high-profile campaigns including TV commercials on ESPN during the NFL Draft and an expanded effort to capitalize on the holiday season.

Prior to joining Lowe's she was Taco Bell's global chief brand officer and worked for Estee Lauder  Unilever Cosmetics International and Revlon .

Lowe's tapped the advertising executive to woo customers as the retailer overhauled its broader business and went more head-to-head with larger rival Home Depot . Led by Ellison who joined Lowe's in 2018 the home improvement retailer has relaunched its website debuted a new loyalty program to chase home professionals' dollars and expanded its merchandise mix to include exercise equipment pet supplies and more home decor.

It wanted to refresh its image too and tapped Thalberg to oversee that. At the time of her hire Ellison said Lowe's hired her to put a more modern spin on Lowe's marketing approach such as personalizing messages on social media for customers instead of relying on traditional channels such as TV and radio.

Thalberg could not be immediately reached for comment.

Lowe's said Thalberg's departure is one of several companywide changes that took effect Friday. It said all changes are meant ""to improve alignment across the business and position Lowe's for success.""

Its business that caters to home professionals such as electricians and contractors will now be under store operations. Tony Hurst a senior vice president who oversees Lowe's pro business will now report to Joe McFarland Lowe's executive vice president of stores. He previously reported directly to Ellison.

Its online team which previously was under Boltz's leadership will now be under the technology team instead of the merchandising team. Mike Shady senior vice president of online will report directly to Lowe's chief digital and information officer Seemantini Godbole.

Lowe's CMO role has not been filled. Instead Lowe's has promoted Jen Wilson as senior vice president of enterprise brand and marketing and she will report to Boltz.

Shares of Lowe's are down about 25% so far this year closing Tuesday at $192.96.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZXZpZXdlZC8yMDIyLzA5LzA1L2xvd2VzLWxhYm9yLWRheS1zYWxlLWRlYWxzLTIwMjIvNzk3MzI5ODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lowe's Labor Day 2022 sale: Save on appliances furniture tools,"Christine Persaud

Annie Schmidt of Schmidt Organization Systems is the professional organizer responsible for turning The Bachelor couple's space into an organized food haven. The home expert tells PEOPLE how they collaborated on the ""clean and modern"" vision.

The walk-in pantry is organized by multiple floor-to-ceiling white shelves with some crisp and ""boho"" touches alike which helped create an open concept look.

""The Lowes are both super easy-going and left it to us to brainstorm and create the perfect pantry for their family"" Schmidt tells PEOPLE. ""Catherine asked for a lunchbox and water bottle area (in floor baskets) and we made sure to include lots of snacks on the bottom shelves for easy access for their three adorable kids!""

Sean and Catherine who are parents to Mia Mejia 2 Isaiah Hendrix 3 and Samuel Thomas 5 also asked to showcase some of their personal collection including artwork on the walls and stacks of cookbooks.

Schmidt created labeled zones for every shelf along with specific bins for certain food items — incorporating some of the kids' favorite snacks. ""Some are more general like 'cooking' — taco shells croutons. And some are [more] specific like 'mac and cheese' and the Lowe's son Isaiah's favorite — seaweed.""

Heather Zak Designs

The Texas-based organizer categorized every shelf in a meticulous layout scheme. Each one serves a particular zone: condiments and oils all go in lazy Susans higher up while decanting jars and acrylic bins go on a mid-tier shelf so that drafting a grocery list is easier. ""Floor items"" include baskets filled with easy-access lunch boxes and paper towels.

""Our main goal is function but we love to create spaces that are aesthetically pleasing and complement the rest of the home's decor"" Schmidt says.

Wicker baskets nestled next to clear baking jars help unify the space by showcasing both neutral and statement pieces. Plus the grab-and-go snacks on the lower shelves are a personal touch to make the pantry kid-friendly for Sean and Catherine's three children.

""The design style that we chose for this pantry is clean and modern with fun boho touches. We love adding fun baskets and pretty labels to elevate and customize each space"" Schmidt says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vY25uLXVuZGVyc2NvcmVkL2RlYWxzL2xvd2VzLWxhYm9yLWRheS1zYWxlcy1kZWFsc9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL2Nubi11bmRlcnNjb3JlZC9kZWFscy9sb3dlcy1sYWJvci1kYXktc2FsZXMtZGVhbHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Save on tools grills and more at the Lowe’s Labor Day sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/deals/lowes-labor-day-sales-deals on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vY25uLXVuZGVyc2NvcmVkL2RlYWxzL2xvd2VzLWxhYm9yLWRheS1zYWxlcy1kZWFsc9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL2Nubi11bmRlcnNjb3JlZC9kZWFscy9sb3dlcy1sYWJvci1kYXktc2FsZXMtZGVhbHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Is LULU a buy?,"The ongoing economic challenges have had a mixed impact on the sports and fitness industry. Athletic apparel stores in general were hit by softening sales while some retailers maintained decent sales volumes like Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU) which benefited from the high demand for fitness and workout products.

The customer base of Lululemon which is specialized in yoga and exercise clothes includes high-income shoppers whose buying habits are generally not affected by macro headwinds like inflation. Promotional programs like in-store yoga classes and related events help in retaining such customers. The Canada-based company’s continued focus on its own brands Lululemon Athletica and Ivivva Athletica gives pricing flexibility and allows it to sell the products at a premium.

The Strategy

The business model goes beyond just selling products rather the strategy is to market an entire lifestyle. In a sign that the method is yielding the desired result an increasing number of customers return to the stores and a section of them use the products more like fashion apparel.

Read management/analysts’ comments on quarterly reports

Lululemon’s stock rose a whopping 15% within a few hours after last week’s earnings announcement marking one of the biggest single-day gains ever. The shares have been trading sideways in the past few months after withdrawing from last year’s all-time high and entering a volatile phase. Currently LULU is one of the most attractive and safe investment options that long-term investors wouldn’t want to miss.

On Track

The management is aggressively pursuing its ambitious Power of Three X2 plan to accelerate international expansion. The plan which envisages doubling revenue by 2026 through product innovation guest experience and market expansion has been successful so far in terms of meeting targets. It is expected to create ongoing value for shareholders.

Lululemon’s CEO Calvin McDonald said in a recent statement “our strategy is to solve for our guests’ unmet needs across their secondary sweat activities such as golf tennis and hike. We roll out targeted innovations while also leveraging the versatility of our core assortment. This not only builds our credibility within the activity but it also allows us to drive overall sales while effectively managing SKUs. Our hike collection which we launched in quarter two is another example of how we are executing our play strategy well.”

Key Numbers

The retailer’s financial performance was quite impressive during the pandemic with earnings and revenues exceeding the market’s projection regularly since early 2020. In the most recent quarter revenues grew by a third to $1.87 billion aided by a 23% growth in comparable store sales. As a result net profit adjusted for special items moved up to $2.20 per share from $1.65 per share in the second quarter of 2021. The top line remains balanced across all operating segments and geographical regions an ongoing trend that helped maintain stable growth

While the better-than-expected second-quarter numbers and the upbeat guidance have brought cheer to shareholders the question is whether the uptrend would be maintained in the second half. It is very likely that Lululemon would stay resilient to the multiple challenges the market is currently facing. Successful execution of growth strategy and near-term targets like adding 75 new units to the store network this year show the business would stay on the growth path.

Target: A few factors to take into account if you are considering this major retailer

Lululemon’s stock got a major fillip following last week’s earnings release. The momentum was maintained in the following sessions reflecting the upbeat investor sentiment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52YWx1ZXRoZW1hcmtldHMuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2ludmVzdGluZy1pZGVhcy90cmVuZGluZy1zdG9ja3MvZGFpbHktc3RvY2std2F0Y2gtbHVsdWxlbW9uLWF0aGxldGljYS1sdWx1LXNoYXJlLXByaWNlLXJpc2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is LULU Stock a Buy?,"Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) stock appears to be holding up as upbeat Q2 earnings paint a brighter picture than expected.

Lululemon Athletica Growth Potential

Last year Lululemon was held back by a lack of inventory. This year it is in a better position and is looking at growth momentum with store openings and product line expansion.

The company recently launched SenseKnit its proprietary fabric technology offering zoned compression for runners. This has proved successful in its core Scuba and Defined franchises for women and its ABC and Commission franchises for men.

The company has plans to launch a two-tier membership program shortly in North America.

Calvin McDonald LULU CEO & Director commented:

While the external environment around us has been challenging we are seeing our guests respond strongly to our product innovations our community activations and our omni-operating model which allows us to meet and exceed their expectations Lululemon has been expanding into new categories including footwear. It’s also looking at growth in some other sports categories and most recently expanded into golf tennis and hiking.

Lululemon's Power of Three x2 growth plan calls for a doubling of the business from 2021 net revenue of $6.25bn to $12.5bn by 2026. The key pillars of the company's plan are:

product innovation

guest experience

market expansion

Meanwhile its growth strategy includes a plan to double men's double direct to consumer and quadruple international net revenue relative to 2021.

Like most clothing retailers Lululemon's business is affected by seasonality. Historically the company has recognized a significant portion of its operating profit in Q4 as a result of increased net revenue during the Christmas holiday season. So seasonal marketing tactics can prove lucrative.

LULU Stock Risks

The company has been dealing with supply chain challenges particularly from China. With the COVID-19 lockdowns there this may continue.

Ocean delivery times are improving although they remain significantly elevated compared to the pre-COVID period.

LULU is using air freight to help ensure timely delivery of products in its distribution centers and is beginning to see these freight rates come down.

The company is involved in various lawsuits regarding patent infringement both as the accuser and accused.

While most of Lululemon's retail locations are currently open further resurgences in COVID-19 including from variants could cause additional restrictions including temporarily closing all or some of its retail locations again resulting in lower consumer demand and causing further disruption in its supply chain.

If inflation and interest rate hikes push the country into a recession consumers will have less disposable income for expensive leisurewear. As such this could hit Lululemon's top and bottom lines.

Should You Invest in LULU?

Inflationary headwinds are a worry for all retailers but Lulu's CEO does not yet appear concerned.

Calvin McDonald LULU CEO & Director commented:

Given the current macro backdrop we have been looking closely at our guest data and metrics to identify any shifts in spending patterns behaviors or habits and to-date I am pleased to share that we are not seeing any meaningful variation in cohort behavior or the metrics we track in this area of the business

Retail makes for a volatile investment in the current macroeconomic conditions. Furthermore LULU's financial metrics paint a potentially overvalued share price which could have further to fall if headwinds prevail.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

After the other woman posted the screenshots the newlywed deleted her Instagram account.

The new bride’s in-laws own the Asplundh Tree Expert Co. in Pennsylvania which is the 109th largest private company in America with a revenue of $5.42 billion in 2023 according to Forbes.

Katherine’s new father-in-law Matt Asplundh has been the CEO of the family business since 2021.

That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Diamond Refractory Services (Diamond) focuses on building capable teams that perform at high levels and on working around the clock to meet customer expectations. Diamond’s talented management team is involved in nearly every level of every turnaround. Diamond reached one of its biggest milestones in company history. It was recently nominated by Marathon Petroleum Corporation and awarded ‘Best in Class’ for soft craft.

“Our priorities are safety a commitment to quality and adhering to our clients’ schedule and budget not the number of turnarounds we undertake” said Chase Drake Diamond’s president and engineering manager. “Our commitment to quality starts with the skilled workers Diamond employs many of whom are hand-picked to keep employee turnover low and performance high” he said.

Diamond trains and pre-qualifies its nozzlemen and welders pre-turnaround utilizing third-party inspection to eliminate any delays and improving overall scheduling. One way Diamond drives performance is by having an entire management team that is API 936 certified. With average employment tenure of 10 years or more Diamonds’ supervisors are among the refractory industry’s most experienced workers and are pivotal players in the company’s success.

Our personnel/hiring manager Claudia Ayala cites our employee loyalty — more than 200 certified alloy welders nozzlemen safety professionals forklift drivers and other skilled professionals — as one of the reasons the company has avoided the skilled worker drought. Ayala has been a key resource in staying compliant with the various local union halls and working closely with our union sister company PMI to ensure the onboarding process for our skilled craftsmen goes smoothly. 25 percent of the Diamond workload is on the West coast making it a top priority to stay complaint with the latest state regulations regarding skilled craftsmen.

“Our skilled workers stay with their teams” Drake said. “I tell clients that the team you see this year will likely be the team you will see again in four years.”

Loyalty isn’t accidental — as many managers can attest. The loyalty to which Drake refers is the result of Diamond’s investment in its employees. He looks for ways to turn new young craftsmen and women into leaders through mentoring — resulting in most of them staying with the company long-term. This loyalty is well-represented by Albert Bares and Jody Hanson. They are responsible for the day-to-day shop operations and equipment maintenance. Both employees have been with Diamond for over 20 years.

“We encourage employees to perfect current skills while also learning new skills” Drake said “with the goal of helping them to become the best at what they do.”

Expand Diamond Refractory Services The message on Diamond Refractory Services’ trailer reinforces what sets the company apart.

This employee continuity fostered by a commitment to training and mentoring can result in tremendous benefits to clients in the form of higher quality better speed-to-project completion times and a stricter adherence to budget.

“Since Diamond became part of EMCOR” Drake explained “we all share the EMCOR Values of ‘Mission First. People Always.’ These values include our belief in mutual respect and trust a commitment to safety and teamwork and integrity discipline and transparency in all that we do.”

Leading by example

Another reason the company has been able to deliver top-tier refractory turnaround services to the refining and process industries across the U.S. since 1999 is that Diamond’s leadership personnel lead by example. Company leadership is not afraid to roll up its collective sleeves and get its hands dirty. The autocratic leadership style that once dominated the American business landscape is purposefully absent at Diamond replaced by an intense immersion by project managers and leaders in the day-to-day workings of the organization. It’s an approach that has 90 percent of the company’s clients returning for more work.

“I’m involved in each project from start to finish” Drake said of his personal commitment to customer satisfaction. “It starts on the business development/sales side. I interact with customers to make sure they’re comfortable doing business with Diamond. I make sure all their questions are answered. I make sure they see me on the jobsite. I do whatever the customer needs me to do.”

It doesn’t stop there though. Throughout the contract stage Drake works with clients to clarify details so each component of the turnaround is well-defined and well-understood.

“I start each project with a kickoff meeting” Drake said. “Pre-turnaround I let my team know what our objectives are and what I expect from each of them. I’ll leave my business card and encourage everyone on the turnaround customers and employees alike to contact me if there are any questions or problems. They know I’ll respond any time day or night.”

“I do three to four site meetings throughout the course of a project” Drake continued. “I also do the transition meetings and toolbox meetings in-between shifts. I want to set an example for our managers. By providing an example to follow I expect all of our projects managers to approach the job the same way I do and to be involved.”

Diamond’s footprint in maintenance and fireproofing has grown substantially with the knowledge and expertise of Randy Major vice president of operations. In addition project managers Jon Broussard and Aaron Mayeux execute over 100000 plus manhours at two different sites.

“Keeping over 125-plus craftsmen year over year is a key concept for Diamond” Major said. “The projects are executed alongside our EIS-affiliated companies AltairStrickland Repcon/TWS and Ohmstede.”

This attention to detail and oversight from field senior management such as Ray Kirkpatrick and Tommy Motichek who both have been with Diamond for over 20 years help Diamond continue to outpace competitors — but it doesn’t stop there. At the end of a project Drake and his team of turnaround professionals circle back to ask probing questions during a post-turnaround meeting to find out what could have been done better.

“It’s a long detailed process” Drake said. “But it’s a worthwhile one — a safer approach to 125-plus turnarounds and counting.”

The benefits of Diamond’s detailed approach to turnarounds extends to the company’s implementation of safety measures.

“We ask employees for solutions to safety concerns” Drake said. “We look to our field personnel for real-world solutions to real-world safety issues. That’s one of the reasons we began using rapid arc welding (RAW) in the field which is safer eliminates fumes and lowers exposure to hexavalent chromium vapor.”

Expand A Diamond Refractory Services welder installs hex cells for pack and ram refractory A Diamond Refractory Services welder installs hex cells for pack and ram refractory.

Engineer Martin De Leon has been enhancing Diamond’s QC Program and RAW procedures to meet almost any base metal/ refractory anchor scenario.

Most of Diamond’s regular workforce is now RAW trained and certified said De Leon which makes them more efficient as a RAW-certified welders who can weld refractory anchors seven-times faster than a traditional welder using an electrode. To date Diamond’s personnel have installed more than one million anchors — that fact alone makes the company one of the most experienced refractory specialists on the Gulf Coast.

Completing over 125 turnarounds with a 90-percent customer retention rate is the result of hard work a fierce commitment to safety and training and a determined willingness to put words into action. Diamond is an industry leader to watch. As Drake said “From the office to field Diamond Refractory Services is committed to leading by example.”

At some brands members represent about two thirds of revenue. Based on franchise disclosures the average Marriott Bonvoy member pays AC Hotels a $200.74 daily room rate and at Westin hotels it’s a $185 daily room rate.

Guests aren’t customers they’re Marriott’s product – and the product that all hotel chains sell to hotel owners. While hotel chains push ‘book direct’ as a way of lowering costs distribution isn’t free. Franchisees pay more for Bonvoy members than non-members on the theory that Marriott is delivering these “leads” to hotels. And those fees fund points that members earn.

For Westin in 2021 Marriott is charging 4.2% of “qualifying revenue generated by customers earning loyalty points or miles” for the cost of Bonvoy not including bonus points. The cost of those is higher than you’d expect.

For AC Hotels though the base charge is just 2.3% of qualifying revenue which includes awarding of base points.

These fees add up with all of the points members earn. During the pandemic Marriott went $800 million into the hole with American Express and Chase pre-selling these points. Marriott reported $5.7 billion deferred revenue as program liability. That makes continually devaluing the points so irresistible. At too many of these programs its the CFO that wins over the long-term value of the business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RyYXZlbC1MZWlzdXJlL01hcnJpb3R0LWFpbXMtZm9yLTEwMC1ob3RlbHMtaW4tSmFwYW4tYnktMjAyNC1leHBhbmRpbmctMzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott aims for 100 hotels in Japan by 2024 expanding 30%,"TOKYO -- Marriott International will increase its presence in Japan by 30% to around 100 hotels by the end of 2024 anticipating an upswing in travel driven by a recovering economy and easing COVID-19 border restrictions.

The U.S. hotel and resort operator plans to open additional locations under its Fairfield by Marriott brand which launched in Japan in 2020. These hotels are generally located at roadside rest stops and work with regional governments to highlight local attractions such as by offering bento boxes featuring the area's delicacies or access to nearby onsen hot springs.

We leverage the partnership globally given that the large Manchester United fan base around the world matches our global hotel footprint.”In the past the programme has provided members opportunity to stand in for NFL players at the dress rehearsal for the Super Bowl take a hot lap with the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team as well as get VIP access to coveted music festivals and concerts secure impossible-to-get restaurant reservations or design their dream wedding gown with renowned wedding designer Justin Alexander.Earlier this year Marriott Bonvoy launched a global competition offering fans the chance to win the first-ever overnight stay at the iconic Old Trafford stadium wherein one fan and a guest got the chance to wake up in the legendary football stadium on match day from the comfort of a suite transformed into a Marriott Hotels guest room overlooking the pitch.Marriott Hotels has also recently transformed two junior suites at the Manchester Marriott Victoria & Albert Hotel into some of Manchester United’s most celebrated moments through history.The redesigned suites include a Seat of Dreams replica from Old Trafford historic Manchester United artwork and premium locker room displays full of exclusive club memorabilia.Povinelli said that Marriott Bonvoy will also be announcing some new experiences exclusively for members of the travel program later this year and for next season wherein members will be able to redeem their points to bid on VIP access to bucket list experiences with the teams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5ndHJhdmVsbmV3cy5jb20vZm9jdXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9ob3ctbWFycmlvdHQtaXMtbGVhZGluZy10aGUtd2F5LXdpdGgtbHV4dXJ5LXByb3BlcnRpZXMtaW4tc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Marriott is leading the way with luxury properties in Saudi Arabia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.breakingtravelnews.com/focus/article/how-marriott-is-leading-the-way-with-luxury-properties-in-saudi-arabia/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5ndHJhdmVsbmV3cy5jb20vZm9jdXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9ob3ctbWFycmlvdHQtaXMtbGVhZGluZy10aGUtd2F5LXdpdGgtbHV4dXJ5LXByb3BlcnRpZXMtaW4tc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hcHBvaW50bWVudC83OTAyNDc0NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christian Metzner has been appointed General Manager at W Singapore – Sentosa Cove,"Moving from one vibrant metropolis to the next veteran hotelier Christian Metzner crosses the border from Malaysia to join W Singapore - Sentosa Cove as General Manager at the iconic 240-key urban escape bringing with him close to three decades of luxury hospitality experience and a fresh strategic vision for the property.

The saying that ""If you fall in love with a country and its people that makes any country warm to you"" could not be more true for Metzner who is no stranger to Singapore having frequented for both business and leisure returning many times to explore places loved and recommended by locals.

Hailing from Germany Metzner's career with Marriott International Inc. began in 1996 at the Arabella Sheraton Complex South Germany in Munich and since then he has held numerous positions within the company including leadership roles in Beijing Tianjin Langkawi and most recently in Malaysia as General Manager at W Kuala Lumpur.

With an extensive background in Sales Marketing and Revenue management Metzner has a clear understanding on the evolving luxury travel expectations and has been forging business strategies in competitive fields around the region. But to him all is for naught without first taking on a people centric approach to things.

When he is not at W Singapore Metzner enjoys spending time with family and friends visiting new restaurants and bars cycling running or winding down at home with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc."

For a long time businesses and consumers have been used to the take make dispose approach to goods and services. But in a world of finite resources this approach cannot be sustainable.

In this episode of the Critical Thinking Critical Issues podcast Mercer U.K.’s Sustainability Integration Lead Vanessa Hodge is joined by Ashleigh Morris CEO and co-founder of Coreo and Jillian Reid Partner in Mercer’s global Sustainable Investment Team to discuss their recent Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC) discussion paper for investors on the circular economy. Also joining the conversation is Jamie Butterworth who is a Partner at Circularity Capital a specialist private equity firm providing access to investment opportunities created by the circular economy.

﻿

On the goals of a circular economy:

It is very much our future economic system. And by definition the circular economy is a systemic approach to economic development. It is designed to benefit business environment and society. It’s underpinned by three globally accepted principles that really help people to ground their understanding of what it is and how it can be applied. The first of those principles is designing out waste and pollution. The second is how we look at keeping products and materials in use at their highest value for as long as possible. The third and final principle is how we can look to regenerate our natural systems.

On how the circular economy is good for business:

Businesses are simply using the circular economy to make more money. So by developing circular business models they are able to keep assets operating longer. They’re able to get a better return on their asset. They’re able to increase the margin that they’re getting through the products that they’re providing and also they’re building the stickier customer relationships with repeat interactions so simply it makes sense for good business.

On the circular economy and capitalism:

At a high level what the circular economy does is it provides a very compelling framework to rethink an economy which is restorative by design. It doesn’t however necessarily solve all of the issues in getting to where we need to get to around climate change and biodiversity.

In terms of … corporates moving in this direction consumer interest in the provenance of products the technology around asset tracking etc. is driving a huge amount of opportunities right now for investors to engage in. The important thing from an investment perspective is to be able to identify those areas in the economy where the circular economy drives the colinearity of the premium financial returns alongside the environmental impact.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxoZWFsdGgubmV0LzIwMjIvMDkvbmF0d2VzdC1sYXVuY2hlcy1tZW5vcGF1c2Utc3VwcG9ydC1zdGFmZi1wZXBweS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NatWest launches menopause support for staff through health app Peppy,"The NatWest Group has teamed up with a former Rewired Pitchfest winner to launch a digital menopause support programme for staff.

The company has made the addition of a US-based KeyPlants organisation and a strategic partner to manufacture KeyPlants PODs and modular facilities for the US and Canadian markets. It will be headed by former Merck Director Andrew Dell.

“As part of our long-term strategy we’re excited to be able to provide US manufacturing capability with rapid delivery of PODs and modular facilities to customers across the US and Canada” said KeyPlants CEO Jörgen Harrysson.

Lowest total cost of ownership

Harrysson explains that in strengthening its North American footprint KeyPlants aims to reinforce its global delivery model for its portable on demand (POD) solutions and innovative modular facilities. This will allow the company to take advantage of global standardisation to provide cost-effective solutions at high speed.

“With manufacturing in the US northeast our mobile X-press PODs solutions launched earlier this year can be on-site and ready for operations in as few as five weeks” Harrysson said. “This compares to a year or more to build a conventional facility from scratch. And we do it at a very competitive price point.”

Pharma veteran to head new organisation

KeyPlants’ US operations will be headed by former Merck Director Andrew Dell. “Andrew knows modular construction well and understands pharmaceutical and biotech companies’ business requirements and their pain points” said Frans Maas Chief Business Officer and board member of the Masco Group KeyPlants’ parent company.

“Coming from the client side makes a great addition to the team as we further develop the American market with our innovative solutions for modular life sciences facilities” he added.

With manufacturing in the US northeast our mobile X-press PODs solutions launched earlier this year can be on-site and ready for operations in as few as five weeks

Dell who will be responsible for the US market adds that besides reducing project risk and project cost X-press PODs and other prefabricated solutions are designed to accelerate commercialisation for new products and processes as well as to support clients in implementing distributed manufacturing (DM) and point-of-care (POC) manufacturing strategies.

“All of this speeds the development of cutting-edge therapies and offers maximum flexibility in production” Dell says. “We are really focusing in on how our PODs and modular facilities can provide the most cost-effective operations with innovations that enable our products to be reconfigurable and agile. So as our client’s business needs change our PODs and modular facilities can pivot to best support whatever’s next.”

Maximum flexibility for lowest TCO

KeyPlants is also introducing internal modules for box-in-box facility fit-outs that provide maximum future flexibility and agility to enable overall cost-effectiveness throughout a facility’s lifecycle. “Traditionally pharma/bio manufacturing assets are designed and built for specific product or process parameters but it’s not unusual for the business to repurpose or redirect a manufacturing facility long before its end of life” says Fredrik Eneqvist Head of Product Development at KeyPlants. “KeyPlants’ PODs and modular facilities have pre-engineered capabilities that allow a client to reconfigure repurpose or replace sub-components of the facility instead of a traditional construction renovation.

“This not only saves money and time but reduces risks and delays associated with construction and renovations of active operating facilities. It gives clients the ability to pivot and evolve based on changes in demand.”

Solution to mitigate supply-chain havoc

In addition as capacity demands are becoming increasingly unpredictable the need for flexible manufacturing has become even clearer —especially post-pandemic. This need has also increased as pandemic-related supply-chain issues have created havoc in many industries around the world including pharmaceuticals.

“We offer clients the flexibility to choose their own equipment platforms” Harrysson adds. “KeyPlants Process Engineering team has experience working with various process technology equipment suppliers and integrators. KeyPlants also has the depth of internal staff to support turnkey projects with capabilities that include facility and process design automation procurement and project controls as well as services to support qualification and process validation.

“Now as part of the Masco Group we are focused on strengthening our global presence and building a robust organisation and partnership relations to meet the challenges facing the life science industry.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mastercard acquires the title sponsorship rights for all home cricket matches (women’s and men’s) as well as domestic first-class cricket

Mastercard today announced its collaboration with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to broaden its strategic outreach to Indian audiences. During this association Mastercard will be the title sponsor for all international matches (both women’s and men’s) held on home ground domestic cricket matches like Irani Trophy Duleep Trophy and Ranji Trophy organized by the BCCI and also all junior cricket (Under 19 and Under 23) matches held in India.

This sponsorship and the activations around it are aimed at enhancing Mastercard’s connection with cricket lovers across the country and beyond. For a brand that is highly invested in sponsorships worldwide with marquee properties like the UEFA Champions league the Grammys the Cannes Film Festival and the Australian and French Open tennis tournaments Mastercard’s tie up with the BCCI further enhances its prestigious portfolio of sponsorships.

Mr. Sourav Ganguly President Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said “The BCCI welcomes Mastercard as the Title Sponsor for home cricket matches for the 2022-23 season. Along with the international home series the BCCI’s domestic tournaments are crucial as they are a steppingstone towards making India a strong international side. The BCCI truly values Mastercard’s support in building Indian cricket. This sport is more than a passion point it’s a way of life and we look forward to some innovative experiences for the fans via this partnership and to deliver value to Mastercard through this collaboration.”

Mr. Jay Shah Honorary Secretary BCCI said “The BCCI is pleased to associate with a global marquee brand - Mastercard. We are in for an exciting period in Indian Cricket as we have Australia and South Africa coming over for white-ball series before the T20 World Cup and Sri Lanka New Zealand and the prestigious Border-Gavaskar Trophy early next year while domestic cricket has a packed calendar with the return of the Duleep Trophy and a full-fledged Ranji Trophy season. The 2022-23 season will witness a lot of action across age groups and I am confident that this will be an enriching partnership.”

Mr. Raja Rajamannar Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Mastercard said “Cricket is a perfect amalgamation of sports and entertainment with immense potential to deliver priceless moments. Our globally recognized Priceless platform offers us the unique opportunity to delight cardholders customers and partners worldwide. Cricket enjoys unparalleled popularity not just in India where it is a singular unifying force for the nation but also in numerous countries around the world. It is therefore particularly relevant and opportune for us to have acquired the title sponsor rights for all home international and domestic cricket matches organized by the BCCI.”

Mr. MS Dhoni India’s legendary cricketer who has been Mastercard’s ambassador for over four years added “Cricket has been my life and given me everything I have. I am thrilled that Mastercard is sponsoring all the home cricket matches of the BCCI and especially the domestic junior and women’s cricket. The Ranji and junior players of today will play for the country tomorrow and continue to embody the pride of 1.3 billion Indians.”

Mastercard endeavors to enhance its strong international base of sponsorship assets across passion points with uniquely Indian ones. Mastercard has worked to amplify this passion area with the signing on of MS Dhoni the former Indian cricket captain as its brand ambassador over four years ago. The synergies envisaged between Mastercard and Indian Cricket will be mutually beneficial for the sport its fans and for the brand during this tenure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkZXhjaGFuZ2VyLmNvbS9hZC1leGNoYW5nZS1uZXdzL3RoZS1hZC10ZWNoLWNvbXBhbnktdGhhdC1rZWVwcy1nZXR0aW5nLWFjcXVpcmVkLWJ5LWJyYW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dynamic Yield The Ad Tech Company That Got Acquired By Two Brands,"Personalization platform Dynamic Yield has the distinction of having been acquired by not one but two large brands.

McDonald’s bought Dynamic Yield in 2019 for roughly $300 million dollars to help modernize and personalize its drive-thru experience outdoor menus and digital ordering kiosks.

Late last year McDonald’s sold the company to Mastercard for an undisclosed sum. (Later during its Q2 earnings McDonald’s reported a $271 million gain related to the sale of its Dynamic Yield business.)

“I guess this is just our destiny” said Ori Bauer who transitioned from CTO to CEO of Dynamic Yield in April after the Mastercard deal closed. Liad Agmon Dynamic Yield’s co-founder and former CEO is now a part-time advisor to Mastercard.

We know you want fries with that

The plan was never to make McDonald’s its permanent home Bauer said.

The purpose of that acquisition was to give Dynamic Yield an inside look at how the restaurant business works so that it could build technology and solutions for McDonald’s that were specifically suited to the QSR vertical.

Historically most of Dynamic Yield’s clients used its technology to deliver personalized shopping recommendations on their websites. But an ecommerce experience is a lot different than an in-restaurant experience.

There’s no add-to-cart-and-think-about-it-later option when you’re making your way through the drive-thru.

But there is the option for people who have downloaded the McDonald’s app to identify themselves when they’re in front of a digital kiosk which means the recommendations can be personalized based on their past orders.

For people without the app McDonald’s can recommend products based on general purchase patterns. If someone orders a veggie burger for example it might not make sense to recommend adding a side of chicken nuggets to their ticket.

Despite the acquisition by Mastercard McDonald’s is still a Dynamic Yield client. It has its former subsidiary’s recommendation technology integrated within digital kiosks across 15000 locations in the US Australia and Canada which is just under 40% of all McDonald’s restaurants.

The technology isn’t proprietary though Bauer said. Having developed a taste for QSR Dynamic Yield plans to court other potential customers in the category with the promise of personalization.

But it hasn’t been all burgers and roses. I mean flowers and fries.

An internal review by McDonald’s found that Dynamic Yield’s technology was responsible for fewer sales “than originally reported” according to The Wall Street Journal.

Although Bauer declined to share specific numbers he did say “McDonald’s remains a very large customer of ours in terms of revenue and the impact that we provide to them.”

New master

Dynamic Yield’s new parent company Mastercard is no stranger to ad tech acquisitions.

Mastercard bought loyalty-management-platform-cum-CDP SessionM in 2019 to help power its loyalty program with personalized real-time offers and to help with closed-loop measurement at the point of sale.

SessionM and Dynamic Yield have complementary offerings said Bauer who noted that roughly a third of Mastercard’s revenue comes from services other than payment processing.

Dynamic Yield is now a part of Mastercard’s Data & Services division which includes marketing services consulting self-service analytics tools for business account customers access to insights based on aggregated and anonymized transactions and a test-and-learn analytics tool that brands can use to measure marketing impact.

Mastercard will use Dynamic Yield’s technology to bolster these offerings which is a growing part of its business. Mastercard’s net revenue from services has increased 118% over the past five years.

And there’s also the opportunity to bring more personalization into the consumer-facing banking experience.

People have come to expect at least some level of personalization regardless of the experience Bauer said whether they’re watching Netflix or using their banking app.

“People have less or even no patience for applications that are not personalized” Bauer said “and that’s as true for financial institutions as it is for any other vertical.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c3Byb21lZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JjY2ktbWFzdGVyY2FyZC10aXRsZS1zcG9uc29yc2hpcC1pbmRpYS1jcmlja2V0LXBheXRtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BCCI and Mastercard agree one-year title sponsorship deal as Paytm bows out early - SportsPro,"Mastercard has signed a new partnership with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) designating the brand as title sponsor for all national team matches and domestic first-class games.

The financial services giant will replace payment solutions brand Paytm which had acquired the title sponsorship rights ahead of the 2019 season in a deal running until 2023 and reportedly worth I₹3.8 crore per match (US$476000).

It was reported earlier this year that Paytm had held talks with the BCCI over handing over the remainder of its contract to Mastercard. This has now been confirmed with Mastercard’s deal covering all national team games domestic cricket competitions – including the Irani Trophy Duleep Trophy and Ranji Trophy – as well as India’s national age group teams.

“The BCCI welcomes Mastercard as the title sponsor for home cricket matches for the 2022/23 season” said Sourav Ganguly BCCI president.

“Along with the international home series the BCCI’s domestic tournaments are crucial as they are a stepping stone towards making India a strong international side.

“The BCCI truly values Mastercard’s support in building Indian cricket. This sport is more than a passion point it’s a way of life and we look forward to some innovative experiences for the fans via this partnership and delivering value to Mastercard through this collaboration.”

Mastercard’s partnership with the BCCI adds to a sponsorship portfolio that also includes the Uefa Champions League and a personal endorsement deal with former India captain MS Dhoni.

Raja Rajamannar chief marketing and communications officer of Mastercard added: “Cricket is a perfect amalgamation of sports and entertainment with immense potential to deliver priceless moments.

Mbappé and Haaland both netted two goals as their respective clubs Paris Saint Germain and Manchester City began their European campaigns with victories underlining just why those two teams are again among the favorites for the title.

Real Madrid’s chances of defending its crown probably depend largely on having a fully fit Benzema but the France forward had to come off with an apparent knee injury in the 30th minute against Celtic. Second-half goals from Vinícius Júnior Luka Modric and Eden Hazard still secured a 3-0 win for the Spanish giant in Glasgow.

Benzema was in a league of his own in the competition last season netting 15 goals in 12 games to lead Madrid to the title. But Mbappé and Haaland look ready to challenge the Frenchman for the status of Europe’s top striker as they try to lead their clubs to an elusive first Champions League title.

The 23-year-old Mbappé who has seven goals in five league games so far scored his double in the first 22 minutes of a 2-1 home win over Juventus to become the youngest player to reach 35 goals in the competition — beating the mark held by teammate Lionel Messi.

The 22-year-old Haaland has 25 goals in 20 Champions League games — also a record — after scoring once in each half of Man City’s 4-0 win at Sevilla. The Norway striker who has 10 goals in six Premier League games this season has now netted on his Champions League debut for three clubs — Salzburg Borussia Dortmund and City.

Also Dinamo Zagreb upset Chelsea 1-0 at home while Serie A champion AC Milan was held to a 1-1 draw at Salzburg.

MBAPPÉ SINKS JUVE

Mbappé's opening goal for PSG came after just five minutes following some audacious link-up play from Neymar.

Mbappé played a short pass to the Brazilian before making a run into the area with Neymar holding onto the ball just long enough before chipping it over a defender and into the path of the France striker who volleyed it first-time past goalkeeper Mattia Perin.

The second came after he exchanged passes with Achraf Hakimi and beat Perin with another first-time finish. United States midfielder Weston McKennie pulled one back for Juventus in the 53rd creating a tense finale in Paris.

In the other Group H match Benfica defeated Maccabi Haifa 2-0.

CHELSEA STRUGGLES

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang couldn’t give Chelsea’s stuttering attack any kind of instant spark as the Blues failed to impress once again following an inconsistent start to the season.

Aubameyang made his Chelsea debut after his move from Barcelona playing with a face mask to protect his injured jaw and had one goal ruled out for offside while his teammates repeatedly failed to beat goalkeeper Dominik Livaković.

Instead it was Mislav Oršić who continued his scoring streak against English teams racing away from Wesley Fofana — another of Chelsea’s marquee signings — to score on a breakaway in the 13th minute.

“It’s an underperformance from us” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel whose team has lost twice in the Premier League already. “We are clearly not there where we need to be. …. At the moment everything is missing.”

Noah Okafor put Salzburg ahead against Milan near the half-hour mark by shooting through the legs of goalkeeper Mike Maignan but Alexis Saelemaekers equalized before the break.

Rafael Leão then nearly won it for Milan in stoppage time when he had a shot deflected off the post.

U.S. international Sergiño Dest came on in the 57th minute for his Milan debut following his transfer last week from Barcelona one of six Americans in action on the night.

CITY ROLLS IN SPAIN

Haaland could well be the piece that Man City has been missing as it repeatedly came up short in Europe under Pep Guardiola.

The Norwegian again showed his uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time as he was on hand to steer in a cross from Kevin De Bruyne in the 21st minute and then tapped in a rebound for the third goal in the 67th. Phil Foden and Ruben Dias scored the other goals for City in a dominant performance at Estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán.

Also in Group G Marco Reus took his tally to 22 goals in 57 Champions League matches by opening the scoring in Borussia Dortmund’s 3-0 win over Copenhagen. U.S. international Gio Reyna set up the other two goals for Dortmund exchanging passes with English teenager Jude Bellingham in a slick move for the third.

HAZARD STEPS UP

If Benzema has to miss significant time for Madrid Hazard signaled that he may be ready to pick up some of the slack.

The Belgium playmaker — who was on the bench before replacing Benzema — set up the first two goals before scoring the third himself against Celtic. It was his first Champions League goal in 651 days and first in any competition since January.

Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was hopeful that Benzema will be back soon though.

“It seems not so serious” Ancelotti said about the striker’s injury.

Callum McGregor had nearly put Celtic ahead in the first half when he struck a fierce shot against the post in the 21st minute.

In the other Group F game Maryan Shved scored twice as Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk beat RB Leipzig 4-1. Shakhtar’s domestic season only recently started after a lengthy break because of Russia’s invasion but the team got some help from Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi for the first goal.

Gulacsi made the blunder of the evening by giving the ball away to Shved as he stood well outside his own area giving the midfielder a simple finish into an empty net.

Leipzig leveled with a goal by French defender Mohamed Simakan in the 57th but Shved restored the lead one minute later.

""The opening game is very important in such a group stage for the mood and for later games in order not to get under pressure"" explained Thomas Müller looking ahead to Wednesday evening (21.00 CEST) in Milan where the Bavarians will open this year's Champions League season at Internazionale. The Bayern veteran knows what he is talking about: with his strike in last year's 3-0 win against FC Barcelona Müller has now contributed eight goals to Bayern's opening streak which also makes him Munich's most successful early starter in the top flight.

In addition to Barcelona other well-known clubs have also experienced the Bavarian opening-match strength in recent years: AS Roma (2-0 H/2010) Manchester City (1-0 H/2014) Benfica (2-0 A/2018) and Atlético Madrid (4-0 H/2020). However not only the streak itself is impressive but also the margins that have secured the victories: FCB's goal difference on Matchday 1 of the Champions League is an incredible 45 scored to only two conceded since 2003 and 16-0 in the eight away games. Since then Bayern have only conceded goals against Celtic (2-1 in 2003) and Valencia (2-1/2012) on Matchday 1. Long may it continue...

Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

McDonald’s newest item for fall doesn’t have pumpkin or maple flavors. Rather it’s a nostalgic treat from more than three decades ago.

Beginning September 14 the chain is bringing back the cheese Danish a flaky pastry filled with sweet cream cheese and topped with a buttery streusel and light vanilla drizzle. McDonald’s said the limited-time offering is a “fresh take” on a similar pastry it briefly served in the 1980s.

It’s the latest example of a fast food giant tapping into nostalgia to excite customers. Pizza Hut recently turned back time reintroducing its logo from the 1990s. McDonald’s frequently brings back the McRib. And Burger King briefly returned the Whopper to its original launch price.

The cheese Danish joins its McCafé bakery lineup an assortment of baked goods it introduced in 2020 to help invigorate its once-sagging breakfast sales. Similar to its other bakery items including an apple fritter a blueberry muffin and a cinnamon roll the cheese Danish is available all day.

Changing its breakfast lineup has helped McDonald’s turn around sales during the crucial part of the day especially as rivals bolster theirs. Wendy’s recently rolled out french toast sticks a nostalgic item for kids as they head back to school.

A recent report from research firm NDP Group revealed that business for mornings has remained steady in the second quarter of 2022 while other parts of day (including lunch and dinner) declined in the midst of rising menu prices.

McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a recent earnings call that breakfast was its “strongest performing daypart” adding that it feels good about it. “It’s a change. If you remember a few years ago I think there were a bunch of questions about breakfast” he conceded.

Sales at its McDonald’s US restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 3.7% in the second quarter with growth being driven by higher menu prices and “value offerings” on its regular menu as well as through its app.

“Over the last few years McDonald’s has proven itself the champion of recognizing and cashing in on current consumer trends wrote Carmen Bryan a consumer analyst at GlobalData in a note Tuesday. “The company has consistently reinvented its menu throughout the pandemic and beyond which has helped it to retain relevance and customer interest.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmJjMjQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWNkb25hbGRzLXNlbGxpbmctc2xlZXZlcy1mb3Itc3VwcG9ydC10by1iZW5lZml0LXJvbmFsZC1tY2RvbmFsZC1ob3VzZS1jaGFyaXRpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's selling Sleeves for Support to benefit Ronald McDonald House Charities,"Local restaurants are back in action with the Sleeves for Support program.

McDonald’s bought Dynamic Yield in 2019 for roughly $300 million dollars to help modernize and personalize its drive-thru experience outdoor menus and digital ordering kiosks.

Late last year McDonald’s sold the company to Mastercard for an undisclosed sum. (Later during its Q2 earnings McDonald’s reported a $271 million gain related to the sale of its Dynamic Yield business.)

“I guess this is just our destiny” said Ori Bauer who transitioned from CTO to CEO of Dynamic Yield in April after the Mastercard deal closed. Liad Agmon Dynamic Yield’s co-founder and former CEO is now a part-time advisor to Mastercard.

We know you want fries with that

The plan was never to make McDonald’s its permanent home Bauer said.

The purpose of that acquisition was to give Dynamic Yield an inside look at how the restaurant business works so that it could build technology and solutions for McDonald’s that were specifically suited to the QSR vertical.

Historically most of Dynamic Yield’s clients used its technology to deliver personalized shopping recommendations on their websites. But an ecommerce experience is a lot different than an in-restaurant experience.

There’s no add-to-cart-and-think-about-it-later option when you’re making your way through the drive-thru.

But there is the option for people who have downloaded the McDonald’s app to identify themselves when they’re in front of a digital kiosk which means the recommendations can be personalized based on their past orders.

For people without the app McDonald’s can recommend products based on general purchase patterns. If someone orders a veggie burger for example it might not make sense to recommend adding a side of chicken nuggets to their ticket.

Despite the acquisition by Mastercard McDonald’s is still a Dynamic Yield client. It has its former subsidiary’s recommendation technology integrated within digital kiosks across 15000 locations in the US Australia and Canada which is just under 40% of all McDonald’s restaurants.

The technology isn’t proprietary though Bauer said. Having developed a taste for QSR Dynamic Yield plans to court other potential customers in the category with the promise of personalization.

But it hasn’t been all burgers and roses. I mean flowers and fries.

An internal review by McDonald’s found that Dynamic Yield’s technology was responsible for fewer sales “than originally reported” according to The Wall Street Journal.

Although Bauer declined to share specific numbers he did say “McDonald’s remains a very large customer of ours in terms of revenue and the impact that we provide to them.”

New master

Dynamic Yield’s new parent company Mastercard is no stranger to ad tech acquisitions.

Mastercard bought loyalty-management-platform-cum-CDP SessionM in 2019 to help power its loyalty program with personalized real-time offers and to help with closed-loop measurement at the point of sale.

SessionM and Dynamic Yield have complementary offerings said Bauer who noted that roughly a third of Mastercard’s revenue comes from services other than payment processing.

Dynamic Yield is now a part of Mastercard’s Data & Services division which includes marketing services consulting self-service analytics tools for business account customers access to insights based on aggregated and anonymized transactions and a test-and-learn analytics tool that brands can use to measure marketing impact.

Mastercard will use Dynamic Yield’s technology to bolster these offerings which is a growing part of its business. Mastercard’s net revenue from services has increased 118% over the past five years.

And there’s also the opportunity to bring more personalization into the consumer-facing banking experience.

People have come to expect at least some level of personalization regardless of the experience Bauer said whether they’re watching Netflix or using their banking app.

“People have less or even no patience for applications that are not personalized” Bauer said “and that’s as true for financial institutions as it is for any other vertical.”"

(Photo by Ralph Freso)

Grand Canyon University which is about to start the 2022-23 academic school year with another record enrollment class on its Phoenix campus is also being recognized for another milestone.

The Christian university has been ranked No. 3 on Forbes’ list of Best Employers in Arizona. GCU checks in right behind the Mayo Clinic at No. 1 and Southwest Airlines at No. 2. Others in the Arizona top 10 are PayPal (4th) Pima Community College (5th) United Services Automobile Association (USAA)(6th) HonorHealth (7th) Costco (8th) WL Gore & Associates (9th) and McKesson (10th).

Mueller points to GCU's work during the pandemic as an important example of how the University continues to thrive. (Photo by Ralph Freso)

“First and foremost I think that is a reflection of the amazing efforts of our GCU employees as well as those at our partner institution Grand Canyon Education to provide the best educational experience possible for students and families” said GCU President Brian Mueller. “Our employees also look at their employment not just as a job but as a calling where they can live out the University’s mission to be servant leaders and pour their collective efforts into outreach opportunities that benefit the greater community. That is a significant part of who we are as a Christian institution and a big reason people want to work here.”

Forbes partnered with market research company Statista to compile its fourth annual list of America’s Best Employers By State. In addition to many of the universal hallmarks of a top employer — such as fair pay safe working conditions and an inclusive culture — Forbes said other priorities also emerged because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We were able to continue to thrive during the pandemic due to our heavy investments in technology” Mueller said. “That enabled students to continue on their academic journey through online and hybrid learning modalities before returning to full in-person instruction. And it benefited our employees who were able to work remotely at a very high level and still meet the needs of our students. Post-pandemic we have found that many of those employees are able to continue to work remotely either full- or part-time.”

GCU did not experience layoffs or furloughs during the pandemic and continued to provide annual pay raises and bonuses to its employees.

Forbes’ list was compiled by surveying 70000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees. Surveys were conducted anonymously allowing participants to freely share their opinions. The respondents were asked to rate their employers on a variety of criteria including safety of work environment competitiveness of compensation opportunities for advancement and openness to telecommuting. Statista then asked respondents how likely they’d be to recommend their employer to others and to nominate organizations in industries outside their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) in collaboration with the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) and corporate partner Medtronic is providing accessible public and patient information that will assist individuals in understanding their own individual journey to better sinus health.

“Understanding the options for nasal and sinus symptom treatments can be overwhelming so we initiated this public service campaign in 2021 as a way to reach patients around the world with reliable information that not only helps them more fully and better understand their symptoms but also helps them decide when it is time to see a physician” said James C. Denneny III MD AAO-HNS Executive Vice President and CEO.

Nasal congestion is a very common complaint and can have many different causes including inflammation inside the nose due to allergies or structural abnormalities such as a deviated nasal septum turbinate blockage or nasal polyps. Sinusitis also called rhinosinusitis because the symptoms involve both the nose and the sinuses affects about one in eight adults annually. Because sinusitis simply means inflammation of the sinuses the word alone includes a variety of similar problems. Acute sinusitis is when the symptoms occur for less than four weeks. A diagnosis of chronic sinusitis requires that the symptoms last longer than 12 weeks. Sometimes these are caused by the same thing but often chronic and acute sinusitis are very different from each other.

“Otolaryngologists are well-positioned to treat nasal and sinus issues both medically and surgically if necessary and the American Rhinologic Society is proud to partner with the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery on this important initiative which will help educate patients so they can access the best care” said Michael G. Stewart MD ARS Executive Vice President.

Bringing attention to the impact of chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction and congestion nasal drainage facial pressure and/or decreased smell that are not responding to medications or other treatments is a focus point of World Sinus Health Awareness Day. Arming patients and their caregivers with clinically proven information is an essential part of this campaign so that they can navigate their way to better sinus health.

“Medtronic is committed to helping ENT patients all over the world and proper education is one of the most important steps” said Amy Van Sach Vice President of Strategy at Medtronic ENT and Acting General Manager of the Intersect ENT business. “We appreciate AAO-HNS and ARS partnering to launch this campaign last year and we are proud to be a key partner once again in sharing this critical awareness information with those who suffer from sinus issues and their caregivers.”

Her experience inspired her to want to pay it forward.

ST PAUL Minnesota — Around this time last year Laura Sosalla was training for the Medtronic Twin Cities Marathon. The St. Paul woman was also dealing with vision loss associated with long COVID something that continues to this day.

""I do feel like people with long COVID or debilitating symptoms it's kind of not talked about or overlooked when the reality is I know that it changes people's lives"" Sosalla said.

Losing sight

In November 2020 Sosalla was driving when struck with a headache unlike any other she had experienced before.

""I'm susceptible to migraines but it was nothing like a migraine. It was literally a hundred times worse"" Sosalla recalled. ""I was noticing these prisms were bursting and... I was getting tunnel vision. My vision was starting to go.""

Sosalla went to the emergency room where doctors figured it was a rare migraine. But over the course of the next six days Sosalla was back in the ER or urgent care two more times.

During this time she tested positive for COVID-19.

""It was a game-changer. Then everyone was like 'Oh this is probably COVID.' Completely changed how they were approaching it"" Sosalla said.

It hurt Sosalla to move her eyes and her vision went in and out of focus.

""It was almost like my eyes... had a little spinal cord injury"" she recalled. ""Then I have blepharospasms; so on top of it they were... clenched shut and I was fighting against this incredible spasm to even open them [her eyes] a little bit.""

In early 2021 Sosalla was declared legally blind. Over time her vision has slowly improved. Interventions including migraine medications steroid and anti-inflammatory eye drops Botox sleep diet and category 4 sunglasses with an FL-41 filter to create darkness to help suppress her symptoms.

""Everything looks like an overexposed photograph"" Sosalla said.

Now 39 years old Sosalla said it's still unclear why she lost her vision. She is part of a National Institutes of Health long-term neurological impacts of COVID study.

""It being an inflammatory disease there were some theories that maybe it inflamed my optic nerves"" Sosalla said.

Dr. Todd Gothard a HealthPartners ophthalmologist and cornea specialist helps with Sosalla's treatment.

""It's very rare"" Dr. Gothard said. ""I think we have gained better insight into COVID in a lot of ways but I think as your case testifies there's still so many unknowns and there's so many of these fairly infrequent things but that can have a profound effect on somebody as far as their vision or their lifestyle.""

Finding her stride

Running is one of the ways Sosalla helps manage her stress.

When she lost her vision she also lost the ability to pursue her passions of running working with horses and accessing the wilderness.

""Running was the easiest to re-attain"" Sosalla said.

Sosalla decided she wanted to run the Medtronic Twin Cities Marathon. She ran her first marathon at the age of 21.

""...Everything I love I depend on other people to give me access to it. So that's a little bittersweet... I always ran independently. It was always just a really solitary thing for me"" Sosalla said.

But it led Sosalla to forming friendships with a group of women.

She got connected with Rachael Bentley through United in Stride — an organization that connects visually impaired runners with guides.

""I started running in high school and ran through college and I just felt like I wanted to do something to sort of give back to the running community is why I signed up"" Bentley said. ""But then I just met Laura and just had another friend.""

Bentley's sister Natalie Elmore joined in the training.

Also at the time Laura Brennan was neighbors with Sosalla's parents. Sosalla was living with her parents while rehabbing from COVID enrolled in Adjustment to Blindness training through MN State Services for the Blind. The pair met and decided to go for a run.

Then MPR News' Lindsay Guentzel heard Sosalla's story and wanted to report on it. She also started running with the group.

All four women have served as running guides for Sosalla holding a tether to stay connected. They also communicate what is coming up for example a lip in the sidewalk. The group helped her cross the finish line at last year's marathon.

""I always viewed running as a solitary thing as well until I started running with Laura and the group of ladies"" Brennan said.

Guentzel added ""We in the last year have seen each other through a lot together which is really interesting because most of us didn't know each other six months before that.""

Sosalla spent the winter resting and finally grieved for everything she had been through since November 2020.

After a season of rest Sosalla is ready to run again. This time she is running the TC 10 Mile in October and plans on doing it with her group of friends.

""I'm not a huge runner and I'll only run if I have a reason and Laura is good enough reason for me"" Elmore said.

Paying it Forward

Sosalla already has plans for the Twin Cities Marathon in 2023.

As a trauma therapist she works solely with first responders. She has experienced firsthand how running can be healing.

Now she is working with some others to get a running group of first responders together. The hope would be to train for next year's marathon.

""The objectives for the first responder marathon training is to focus on using running together as a way to manage stress heal from past traumas combat the burnout and compassion fatigue from being chronically understaffed overworked (while still struggling with the aftermath of COVID and social unrest) to overcome hardship and coming together through a shared goal"" Sosalla said.

If participants feel comfortable it would also give them an opportunity to tell their story.

""I think a surprise from the marathon was how much that contributed to my own healing to have the opportunity to tell my story and I had no idea it was going to be as healing as it was"" Sosalla said.

Sosalla is working with Darcy Berard from the Running Room and Johnny Surprise with Blue Peak.

Those interested in joining the running group can contact Surprise at jsurprise@bluepeak.one.

Throughout Sosalla's journey she's found strength in numbers.

""We have to depend on each other in order to excel or grow or challenge ourselves"" Sosalla said.

She went on to say about her running group ""We all just kind of came together. We're sort of this hodge-podge of people and running is... the common denominator. Yeah they've absolutely turned into like sisters.""

Over the past 20 years the FTSE 100 medical devices group has regularly been tipped as a takeover target with the list of rumoured trade suitors including Johnson & Johnson Biomet Zimmer & Stryker and Medtronic.

However some analysts reckon that this time the speculation could be a little firmer than previously and with the stock trading well below historic multiples private equity could be interested. With most of Smith & Nephew’s business conducted in dollars and euros the falling pound also serves to make the company look cheap.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.reuters.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711AEE170>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

The Team Amani film captures the immersive ways that the metaverse can help people connect in a way they couldn’t have otherwise. It reflects the team’s dream to making it to the sport’s greatest stage.

Mike Hasinoff executive producer from Droga5 said “ All footage was shot in Kenya Uganda and South Africa over the course of a month. All cycling footage was captured using multiple cameras everything from an Alexa to a drone Super-8 and even a Fisher-Price and FlipCam Video Recorder. We also worked with the legendary Tony Hill to design bespoke rigs to play off the circular motion of a bike wheel.”

Tragically Amani’s team captain Sule Kangangi lost his life in an accident at a high-speed race in Vermont on August 27th. Team Amani remains committed to realising his ambitions describing him as ‘our guiding pole star as we press forward in the realisation of his dream’.

Droga5 senior art director Ben Muckensturm says “In the wake of the Kangangi tragedy Team Amani ""remains committed to realising his ambitions.""

In partnership with Love Song we tapped into directing duo Illimité World to be the perfect storytellers for this underdog cycling story. ILLIMITEWORLD (French for 'Limitless World') consist of two up-and-coming directors of colour - Aus Taylor and Marleaux Desiré - 'The world is y(ours)' is a mantra used by the native-Baltimore duo using it as a reminder that each artistic offering is a view into the world of their imaginations. Using an experimental combination of classical cinema creative animation and raw documentary style filmmaking they share with viewers a surprising perspective of the modern world.

Daniel Wolfe who also executive produced Meta’s award-winning and Emmy-nominated film 'Skate Nation Ghana' served again as executive producer on the film. Known as a trusted mentor to many young directors he collaborated closely with ILLIMITEWORLD to capture the riders competing in the metaverse with a blend of both striking visuals and human depth.

Added Hasinoff “This production follows in the footsteps of what we set up with Love Song with 'Skate Nation Ghana.' With that film we set out to use the production to try to help bring about systemic change with regards to DEI in production in our industry. We approached Daniel Wolfe a trusted close collaborator and mentor to many young directors and discussed a unique director structure: three young directors from the West African diaspora (Bafic Elliott Power and Justyna Obasi). We’ve now pushed this model to another level with this latest film with ILLIMITEWORLD also supported by the next generation of three young assistant directors on some of their first productions.”

The ‘Amani’ campaign will run on Facebook and Instagram and off platform. Off platform distribution includes broadcast (e.g. ABC NBC CBS etc) online video and connected TV (e.g. YouTube Wired CNBC Conde Nast). A few TV program highlights for our launch week include the VMA’s bachelor America’s Got Talent Master Chef and MLB.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvc2VwLzA1L2luc3RhZ3JhbS1vd25lci1tZXRhLWZpbmVkLTQwNW0tb3Zlci1oYW5kbGluZy1vZi10ZWVucy1kYXRh0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMi9zZXAvMDUvaW5zdGFncmFtLW93bmVyLW1ldGEtZmluZWQtNDA1bS1vdmVyLWhhbmRsaW5nLW9mLXRlZW5zLWRhdGE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Instagram owner Meta fined €405m over handling of teens’ data,"Instagram owner Meta has been fined €405m (£349m) by the Irish data watchdog for letting teenagers set up accounts that publicly displayed their phone numbers and email addresses.

The Data Protection Commission confirmed the penalty after a two-year investigation into potential breaches of the European Union’s general data protection regulation (GDPR).

Instagram had allowed users aged between 13 and 17 to operate business accounts on the platform which showed the users’ phone numbers and email addresses. The DPC also found the platform had operated a user registration system whereby the accounts of 13-to-17-year-old users were set to “public” by default.

The DPC regulates Meta – which is also the owner of Facebook and WhatsApp – on behalf of the entire EU because the company’s European headquarters are in Ireland.

The penalty is the highest imposed on Meta by the watchdog after a €225m fine imposed in September 2021 for “severe” and “serious” infringements of GDPR at WhatsApp and a €17m fine in March this year.

The fine is the second largest under GDPR behind the €746m levied on Amazon in July 2021.

A DPC spokesperson said: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405m. Full details of the decision will be published next week.”

Caroline Carruthers a UK data consultancy owner said Instagram had not thought through its privacy responsibilities when letting teenagers set up business accounts and had shown an “obvious lack of care” in users’ privacy settings.

“GDPR has special provisions to make sure any service which targets children are living up to a high standard of transparency. Instagram fell foul of this when accounts of children were set to open by default rather than private.”

Last year Meta suspended work on a version of Instagram for children following revelations about the app’s impact on teen mental health.

Instagram said it was “pausing” work to address concerns raised by parents experts and regulators. The move followed revelations from a whistleblower Frances Haugen that Facebook’s own research showed Instagram could affect girls’ mental health on issues such as body image and self-esteem.

Instagram has said that prior to September 2019 it had put user contact details on business accounts and had informed users during the setup process. Under-18s now have their account set to private automatically when they join the platform.

Andy Burrows head of child safety online policy at NSPCC said: “This was a major breach that had significant safeguarding implications and the potential to cause real harm to children using Instagram.

“The ruling demonstrates how effective enforcement can protect children on social media and underlines how regulation is already making children safer online.”

A Meta spokesperson said: “This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago and we’ve since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private.

“Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram so only people they know can see what they post and adults can’t message teens who don’t follow them.

“While we’ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it. We’re continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.”"

It was the Rammstein concert at MetLife Stadium. The German industrial band unleashed a two-plus hour spectacle that was loud brash blinding over-the-top impolite and entertaining — when it wasn't disorientating.

It was kind of like “Cabaret” on steroids.

Did we mention these guys are into fire? There didn't seem to a flash pot firework flame thrower stage explosive or pyrotechnic that wasn't deployed on Tuesday. Lead singer Till Lindemann even appeared to incinerate keyboardist Christian Lorenz who was conveniently in a cooking pot at the time.

Lindemann shot a flame-throwing cannon at him. Lorenz miraculously emerged to peck out very dramatically the opening notes of their biggest hit “Du Hast” as the band returned to the music.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

The members of Rammstein are very theatrical especially with fire.

Audience members damp from the rain felt the heat. And heard the music. It was the loudest this reviewer has experienced at MetLife although the Aventura reunion show last year is a close second.

The loud and plundering songs all sung in German do not vary much. The band stuck with its industrial 4/4 rhythmic formula pretty closely. It was initially impressive with its sheer force but grew monotonous as the night waned.

Lindemann didn't wilt. He's a campy performer with a expressive face. Physically he's a cross between Jackie Gleason in “Gigot” and Otto Preminger in “Stalag 17.” He continuously mimed while on stage when he wasn't bellowing with his full-throated baritone.

An unfortunate moment occurred between the main set and the encore when the cameraman spanned audience members and several female fans flashed their breasts. The camera lingered on a few women who did not comply seemingly egging them on to flash.

The Rammstein production crew needs to realize this isn't 1999 anymore and sexual intimidation doesn't fly. Besides there were enough distractions to keep the approximately 40000 engaged from band members crowd surfing on inflatable boats to the keyboard player running on a treadmill throughout the show.

In September 2020 Bosa suffered a torn ACL in San Francisco’s Week 2 matchup against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium which uses UBU Sports Speed Series S5-M Synthetic Turf on its field.

Stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.

Speaking with Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer Bosa sounded off his frustration about turf and how playing on this surface is a real issue in the NFL.

“I really think FieldTurf is a problem in the NFL” Bosa told Breer in the latest edition of Monday Morning Quarterback. “And the turf I played on in New York was brand new. It was super soft and apparently they rolled a cement roller over it twice after the game because we had two ACLs and a bunch of other injuries on it.”

The NFL Players Association has presented data which found that players have a 28 percent increased rate of non-contact lower extremity injuries while playing on artificial turf.

Players also face a 32 percent higher rate of non-contact knee injuries on turf and a 69 percent higher rate of non-contact foot or ankle injuries on turf than on grass.

Additionally Bosa believes that if the NFL considered player safety regarding the field surface they would be playing on grass rather than artificial turf which most teams use.

The 49ers' edge rusher cites how soccer clubs in top European leagues have their players on grass weekly during their season as an example for the NFL to replicate.

Bosa isn’t only voicing his frustrations to Breer; the 49ers defensive lineman has put his words into action. In February he put together a petition to push the NFL to switch from turf to grass.

“Every player is one play away from altering their career forever when playing on turf” Bosa tweeted. “I experienced the bad side of this and it could have been avoided.”

The 49ers’ edge rusher isn’t alone in this fight to have grass in all NFL stadiums: teammates George Kittle and Deebo Samuel have backed Bosa calling for the league to make changes to protect players from career-altering injuries.

It will be up to the NFL if they want to listen and modify the fields across the league.

Fans already know how much CONNECT BTS means to the members even though it has only been a few days since BTS launched their latest worldwide art project. Jin and Jungkook both discussed how the project would bring people together through variety while Jungkook claimed it would draw attention to the connections between art and music.

Since RM is frequently pictured attending art exhibitions similar to the ones CONNECT BTS will be displayed the project must also hold a lot of significance for him. Let’s look at five instances where RM demonstrated his abiding appreciation of the arts.

As befits RM who has previously visited art galleries in London the CONNECT BTS series just opened with a show at the Serpentine Galleries in London. RM made sure to schedule a time to see London’s renowned National Gallery before BTS traveled there for their sold-out “Love Yourself: Speak Yourself” performances at Wembley Stadium. Fans in London caught RM studying a famous Canaletto painting from the 1700s called Venice: The Grand Canal with S. Simeone Piccolo which depicts the stunning architecture of the city using perspective light and detail.

RM frequently fits art excursions into BTS’s travel plans. RM published pictures of himself at the Metropolitan Museum of Art taken when the group traveled to New York City to perform at the MetLife Stadium last May. In his images RM may be seen admiring a variety of well-known works of art including Claude Monet’s Lane in the Poppy Fields. It appears that the Met was equally pleased to meet him. After his visit they sent a tweet in Korean praising him for coming.

RM like modern art as well as artworks that have been around for millennia. He posted images from his trip to the Seoul solo exhibition Normal Life which featured works by contemporary artist Kim Hee Soo last September. In order for the viewer to visualize oneself in the painting the artist draws common individuals without expression or personality. For RM who leads a life that is anything but average it must be a special and gratifying experience!

Without an art trip what would an RM vacation be? RM took a break in Jeju and went to the Bonte Museum which features both conventional and contemporary Korean arts and crafts. This remarkable installation which is a small 4 x 4-meter chamber with mirror walls and ceilings has crossed the world. The audience is positioned on a platform in the center of the water pool with 100 different colored lights all around them.

Namjoon tweeted a picture of himself holding a sizable “moon jar” also known as dalhangari during one of his most recent art excursions. These enormous pots are much more amazing than they appear since each one is painstakingly constructed from two distinct halves welded together using at least 40kg of clay. Kwon Dae Sup the artist had initially planned to be a painter before being suddenly inspired when he stumbled across an old moon jar. Aware fans discovered that their idol actually saw the jars in Kwon’s home near Paldang Lake Gyeonggi. Perhaps RM couldn’t attend the artist’s exhibition at the Park Ryu Sook Gallery earlier that month.

Hopefully RM and the other BTS members will be able to attend the opening of the Seoul exhibition later this month!

JACKSONVILLE Fla. – Publix is celebrating 92 years of business on Tuesday.

We wanted to tell a story — starting with the first store that ever opened in Winter Haven on Sept. 6 1930.

In the midst of the Great Depression Jenkins walked away from the security of a good job to open the first Publix store Publix wrote. Gross annual sales in the early years averaged about $100000 slowly rising to $120000 by 1934.

While many of his competitors’ store shelves went bare for lack of goods Jenkins traversed the country seeking products to send back home to stock his stores. In his travels Jenkins also garnered ideas about how to better the business. Click here to read more.

Jenkins was the first person to introduce people to the big green Toledo Publix scales (known by the store as People Weighers) in 1930.

“Our founder having the vision to be a customer service expert he thought having scales in the store without having our customers pay for it would be a treat — and it was” said Dwaine Stevens who has worked for Publix for around four decades.

Stevens is referring to the decision by Publix in the early years to make the scales free of charge. Many scales in that era required payment because people did not have scales in their own homes.

But you won’t find the scales in Publix stores outside of Florida except for a few just over the Georgia border. Stores in other southern states where Publix operates don’t install the scales partly because there are only so many scales left.

The manufacturer Mettler Toledo stopped producing them in 2015.

The 2022 ERP Report by Panorama Consulting shows that only 3.6% of enterprises implement ERP software without any modifications while the majority of ERP adopters conduct moderate to heavy customization.

Nevertheless ERP customization is not an easy task. It typically involves rewriting software code and introducing system architecture changes. Needless to say such disruptions may cause serious difficulties and risks jeopardizing the success of ERP customization projects.

This article covers the main challenges of ERP customization and provides several tips on how enterprises can overcome them.

What are the main challenges of ERP customization?

Increased ERP development costs

Even though ERP software allows enterprises to gain multiple business benefits and thereby become more prosperous ERP development typically requires huge upfront investments. According to the 2022 ERP Software Report by Software Path the average budget per user for an ERP project is $9000 while the total cost of development may equal hundreds of thousands of dollars. So naturally if your ERP project includes customization the total cost of ERP development may be overwhelming.

Hard-to-predict bugs

As mentioned above ERP customization often involves modifying the software code and this can cause troubles at multiple levels if not done properly. For example after developers made changes to the existing solution new sometimes critical bugs may appear. In the worst-case scenario an ERP system may not function properly which can paralyze the work of several enterprise departments at once.

Complicated software management and maintenance

Generally ERP vendors are responsible for updating their software solutions and delivering new versions. However if an enterprise decides to implement new features to its ERP system through customization it has to update and maintain the modified version in-house. This in turn may become a severe burden for the enterprise IT department and create cybersecurity risks.

How to perform ERP customization successfully

Now that we have covered the main challenges of ERP customization let’s discuss how an organization can overcome them and ensure the customization project will succeed. Here are several recommendations that can come in handy.

Set clear project goals and requirements

Depending on your business need you may need to customize ERP user interface and experience and functionality or even develop custom integrations to connect ERP software with other corporate systems. However none of these customizations will be completed successfully if you do not clearly understand the customization project’s goals and requirements.

Therefore before the development begins you should initiate a series of meetings with managers of your departments — finance human resources inventory management and so on — to discuss the purpose and viability of customizations. In particular you can ask your colleagues these and other questions:

Why should we initiate ERP customization? What business challenges can we resolve with this project?

Do we need moderate or more radical customizations? Should we modernize the entire ERP software architecture?

Can we develop customizations ourselves or should we hire third-party developers?

What KPIs should we use to monitor customization progress?

Ideally at this preparatory stage you may also need to conduct a thorough business analysis and map your workflows related to enterprise resource planning. This way you will be able to better understand your internal processes and how they are connected which will enable you to determine the customization types that may be most relevant for your business case.

Prioritize changes when planning customizations

As we have noted the more customizations you implement the higher the risk that something goes wrong and in the case of over-customization critical technical issues may arise. Therefore we recommend starting with customizations that have the most apparent value and only then gradually implementing modernizations that seem less important.

Take into account competitors’ experience

If you have information about similar projects completed by organizations from your business niche try to draw on their experience when initiating your own ERP customization project. This way you can avoid the challenges someone has faced before.

Consider consulting ERP development experts

If you realize that your skills and competencies are not enough to carry out successful ERP customization or you feel that you need expert advice consider hiring third-party ERP consultants. ERP development experts can not only help you make the best choice regarding the customization type and make sure that your idea is viable but also suggest which development approaches are best suited for your specific business case. If necessary you can also delegate the entire customization process to a third-party consultant.

Final thoughts

Given the importance of effective enterprise resource planning a reliable ERP solution is a must-have for a growing business that wants to remain prosperous and competitive. In addition if an organization aims to get the most out of its enterprise resource planning it should invest in ERP customization to tailor the software solution to corporate business processes and workflows.

Nevertheless conducting ERP customization is not easy. If done improperly an enterprise may not only spend hundreds of thousands of dollars but also disrupt an existing ERP solution. Fortunately organizations can mitigate most of the customization risks with a clear understanding of business goals prioritization of customizations and taking into account the competitors’ experience.",,,,,,

A hook-up between MGM and European operator Entain BetMGM Sportsbook offers all of the sports and wager types you would expect from a modern sportsbook as well as a host of additional features.

So let’s take a deep dive into what they have to offer and compare them to the best sports betting sites in New York to see if they sink or swim. However if you want to join BetMGM before we review the sportsbook be sure to check out BetMGM’s current bonus code offers when you register for a new account.

Is BetMGM Sportsbook legal to use in New York?

Legal sports betting in New York has been around since 2013 albeit only for those able to visit a licensed casino or retail sportsbook. But today everybody on NY State soil is able to wager legally thanks to a law change that lifted the ban on online and mobile sports wagering in the Empire State for the first time.

January 2022 was the fateful date that online sports betting in New York went live for the first time after former Governor Andrew Cuomo gave the industry the green light after being included in the state budget bill.

There’s still some do’s and don’ts to be aware of and you can read our New York betting guide for more information on those. But for the most part anyone in NY can place their sports bets at one of the nine (at the time of writing) approved operators which includes BetMGM.

Therefore you can register for a BetMGM account with complete confidence.

How to join BetMGM Sportsbook

Of all the legal sportsbooks in New York it’s perhaps BetMGM that makes it easier than any other operator to get up and running with a new account.

You can register using this link or in the usual way of heading to their website downloading the app and signing up there; more instructions are included below. However you’ll want to use our link to sign up because you’ll receive a bonus bet worth up to $1000 as a sign-up bonus.

But there are other ways that you can quicken up the registration process with BetMGM allowing PayPal customers and Yahoo! Sports players to automatically bypass some of these steps by using their existing details.

If you do need to register for a new account in the traditional way simply follow these steps:

Click here to register for a new account. Enter your personal information (name address date of birth etc.). Select your chosen username and password. Confirm your registration.

Your account will be set up live immediately and once you have made your first deposit you will be free to wager on your favorite sports and teams at BetMGM Sportsbook.

What is the BetMGM Sportsbook welcome bonus?

There’s no confusion or complication to BetMGM Sportsbook’s welcome bonus in New York; they have decided to keep things nice and simple.

So after registering and making a deposit you can claim a bonus bet of up to $1000 on the first wager you place with the operator. All you have to do to claim this offer is register for a new account using this link.

The amount offered is identical to the amount you bet (up to the $1000 limit) and what happens next is nice and straightforward: if your bet wins you get to keep your payout as normal. If this first wager loses however your stake will be refunded as bonus bet credits.

There are a couple of terms and conditions to be aware of. Your qualifying bet must be a minimum of $10 and placed at odds of -200 or higher; you can’t simply cash in on a red-hot favorite. If your wager loses then amounts between $10 and $49 will be refunded as one single bonus bet. If you staked between $50 and $1000 you will receive five bonus bets of equal proportion e.g. 5x $10 to make up $50.

BetMGM Sportsbook odds

The best word to describe the odds available at BetMGM Sportsbook would be “competitive.”

In our research they were rarely the outright best for individual game betting but they were certainly within close range—over the course of a year for example their consistency would ensure you weren’t giving up too much in the way of value.

If we take a look at a random NFL game we note that BetMGM had priced the Tennessee Titans as +140 underdogs and the Green Bay Packers as -165 favorites—neither were the best odds available but only a couple of points shy of the value prices. If we fire up the NFL Super Bowl odds here’s how BetMGM ranked compared to FanDuel Sportsbook at the time of writing:

Buffalo Bills +380 (BetMGM +400)

Kansas City Chiefs +500 (BetMGM +450)

Philadelphia Eagles +600 (BetMGM +600)

San Francisco 49ers +800 (BetMGM +850)

Minnesota Vikings +1100 (BetMGM +1100)

Baltimore Ravens +1300 (BetMGM +1200)

Live streaming at BetMGM Sportsbook

Being able to live stream action from around the world is a major perk for sportsbook customers and BetMGM Sportsbook is able to oblige. You can watch soccer tennis basketball and other sports from around the world via the BetMGM website or app with high-quality streams and minimal lagging helping to enhance the experience.

You can see which games are available to stream by clicking on the ‘live’ tab and looking out for the TV icon. And don’t forget that you can bet in-play at BetMGM so if you spot some value during your live stream it’s easy to hop back over to the sportsbook and place your wagers.

BetMGM deposits and withdrawals

In our research BetMGM Sportsbook ranks very highly among New York sportsbooks for the number of payment methods that it accepts.

The operator charges no fees and deposits are carried out instantaneously; you can get betting in seconds. As for withdrawals the time it takes for you to receive your money depends upon the method chosen; PayPal withdrawals can be with you within 24 hours.

BetMGM Sportsbook review verdict

As soon as you register for a new BetMGM account you can see and feel that this is a classy sportsbook that simply knows what works.

Their partnership with Entain who have been around for decades in Europe is evident in a website and app that is so simple to use and yet feels professional and slick at the same time. There’s a solid range of sports here with excellent diversity in the bet types available. The addition of live streaming and a comprehensive payment platform also helps.

You may find more lucrative welcome bonuses elsewhere but a $1000 bonus wager is not to be sniffed at and BetMGM prides itself on offering promotions to both new and existing customers.

Backed by one of the best sports betting apps in New York BetMGM Sportsbook simply cannot be given anything other than a five-star rating.

In place of empty streets thousands of jersey-clad fans and workers filled the Strip hitting the Bellagio and Caesars Palace. The 2022 NFL Draft was an announcement that Vegas was back and it also served as proof that the city could handle a large-scale event for America’s biggest sports league.

“I talked to Roger Goodell three or four times since the draft and he was just astounded at how well it came off” Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said in a sitdown interview with The Athletic in May. “He goes ‘It was better than perfect.'”

Once all but taboo in the world of sports Sin City is now the home of the Golden Knights Aces and Raiders one of the NFL’s most iconic franchises. Vegas will host the Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium in 2024 an idea that once seemed nearly impossible for a city that was a pro sports backwater not that long ago.

“I moved here in 1985 and honestly I never thought that there would be any pro sports here in Las Vegas” said Jeff Stoneback director of sportsbook trading operations for MGM Resorts International.

But through decades of business deals bureaucracy and changes in public perception Vegas has transformed from a barren wasteland into a sprawling metropolis in the world of sports. And it’s not done growing just yet.

In 1984 then-Utah Jazz owner Sam Battistone considered relocating the team to Las Vegas so he planned a split home schedule with a handful of games at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center.

There was a catch. The NBA wanted the sportsbooks to take Jazz games off the board when they were in town. The sportsbooks pushed back. Once it became clear the NBA wouldn’t come otherwise they relented.

“The sports betting community got together and universally said ‘OK we’ll do this as a favor. We don’t like it. We don’t think it’s right. But to get the Jazz here we’ll take the games off the board'” said 8NewsNow anchor Ron Futrell who has covered sports in the city since 1984.

“But I also got the impression that it was Never again too by the sports betting community: No we’re not going to acquiesce. And of course they never did again.”

Outside of hosting Game 4 of the Lakers and Blazers’ first-round series following the 1992 L.A. riots the NBA lacked a significant presence in Vegas until the inaugural NBA Summer League in 2004. Former mayor Oscar Goodman pushed to get the 2007 NBA All-Star Game in Vegas but the weekend went poorly with over 400 people arrested. The Summer League remained but it was clear that would be it.

The NBA’s posture illustrated a broader trend: Major pro sports leagues would flirt with Vegas but they weren’t willing to commit.

Still the flirtations were instrumental to the eventual breakthrough. In 1997 the NHL launched an annual preseason contest dubbed “Frozen Fury” between the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche at MGM Grand Garden Arena. The event regularly sold out and brought an influx of tourists to the city — along with significant sponsorship dollars — and ultimately evolved into a week-long affair.

“And all of the sudden we were kind of looking around going ‘My God the number of people that want to come in from Southern California and spend a three or four-day weekend to go to a preseason hockey game'” said Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke who helped run Frozen Fury as president of the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). “What does that tell you about Vegas?

“This isn’t about the two or three million people that live there: It’s about the 50 million people that come there.”

It wasn’t exactly a novel idea. Late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson and current CEO Rob Goldstein for example raked in money by building convention and exhibition spaces. Combined with the city’s existing hotel rooms and seemingly endless entertainment options it made Vegas the go-to place for such events. Through the tourism that followed conventions would dominate the city.

Major players in the sports business world began to come around on Las Vegas as a legitimate market. And they became more optimistic about the ability to construct state-of-the-art facilities.

In 2007 Leiweke and AEG entered a partnership with Harrah’s Entertainment to build a 20000-seat arena with plans to break ground in 2008. That deal never came to fruition thanks in large part to bureaucratic gridlock but in 2012 AEG formed a new partnership with MGM Resorts International which had come up with a project that would rely solely on private funding for the $375 million in estimated construction costs. The partnership announced the plan in 2013 and in 2014 began construction on what would ultimately be dubbed T-Mobile Arena built to meet both NHL and NBA specifications.

“There was always a lot of momentum and chatter there. I think the fact that we along with our partners at AEG made the leap to go ahead and build a state-of-the-art venue helped” said Dan Quinn VP of entertainment for MGM Resorts International and general manager of T-Mobile Arena. “Had another team wanted to either relocate here or talk about adding an expansion team here the natural question would’ve been ‘Well where are they gonna play?'”

The arena solved that problem. Both AEG and MGM Resorts were confident that it would be profitable off of concerts boxing matches UFC events and conventions alone but as Leiweke pointed out when it came to sports franchises the venue was built on the concept of “If you build it they will come.”

Now Vegas just needed one to bite.

The NHL had already been nibbling. With a two-decade-long presence in Vegas thanks to Frozen Fury the league had conversations with businessmen Bill Foley and George Maloof about leading a potential ownership group for an expansion team after construction began. Still longtime NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was skeptical.

“He couldn’t believe that we’d be able to sell that many tickets in the desert for hockey” said Sisolak.

The NHL gave Foley the green light to hold a season ticket drive in December 2014 with a goal of 10000 deposits. That mark was hit by April 2015 quelling Bettman’s doubts. In June 2016 two months after T-Mobile Arena opened Foley’s bid was approved by a unanimous vote of NHL owners.

Major professional sports was in Vegas for the first time — but an even more massive shift was underway.

In July 2015 then-Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval created a committee to explore what it would take to construct a 65000-seat stadium big enough to lure a potential NFL franchise. The same month T-Mobile Arena opened the Raiders sat down with Las Vegas representatives at one of the committee meetings to discuss their possible relocation from Oakland.

The biggest question was how the stadium would be funded. Raiders owner Mark Davis said he would contribute $500 million toward the projected $1.84 billion cost and Adelson — who at the time of his death in January 2021 had a net worth of around $40 billion — was on board to make a $650 million contribution of his own but the project would still need significant public money. In September 2016 the committee approved a plan with $750 million funded by a hotel room tax increase.

“The big thing to get the community involved was the jobs” said Sisolak who worked in the Clark County Commission at the time. “We were coming out of a tough time — jobs were in short supply — and this was a lot of both construction and permanent jobs.”

Opponents argued that the money raised through the room tax increase would be better off used on public and social needs according to LVSportzBiz founder Alan Snel who covered the debate.

“This whole streak of stadium and arena construction (happened) against the backdrop of a market that literally is at the bottom of the country in terms of primary care doctors per capita surgeons per capita health and medical resources and … education and teachers” Snel said. “Las Vegas for so many years held back from subsidizing and backing sports with public money and now it’s completely both feet in the pool.”

After passing through the committee the plan needed to make it through the Nevada Legislature. It did but not without controversy — one Republican lawmaker called the proceedings a “disgrace” and “​​stacked deck” after the bill was voted on in the 42-seat state Assembly without first being debated.

Three months later the Raiders officially filed relocation paperwork with the NFL.

“The NFL was the 900-pound gorilla” Snel said. “And it definitely made Las Vegas big-time overnight.”

The city was still reeling in response to the deadliest mass shooting in American history when the Golden Knights began their inaugural season. On Oct. 1 2017 a gunman had opened fire on a crowd of people at a music festival from a room at the Mandalay Bay hotel killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more.

Nine days later after honoring victims and first responders the Golden Knights took to the ice at T-Mobile Arena amid banners featuring the hashtag #VegasStrong.

“The community just latched on to them” Sisolak said. “They were very active in the community. They were out in the schools and working with all the civic organizations. They really had a big presence here.”

One week later the NBA and WNBA approved the sale of the San Antonio Stars to MGM Resorts which relocated the team to Vegas and renamed it the Aces. In just 16 months three major sports franchises had elected to make the city their new home.

And as it became clear that the Golden Knights were pretty damn good — they went 51-24-7 on their way to a Stanley Cup Final appearance — Vegas took to sports in a way it hadn’t since the days of the high-flying UNLV men’s basketball teams under Jerry Tarkanian.

“There was tremendous pride here when the Runnin’ Rebels won the national championship. This town was lit up. It was electric. You could feel it” Futrell the 8NewsNow anchor said. “I don’t feel like it came back until the first season of the Vegas Golden Knights.”

The official capacity for hockey games at T-Mobile Arena is 17500 but the average attendance for the first season was 18042. The city had grown something organically and latched onto it as theirs.

“I think it had a profound influence on everyday residents literally buying into their first sports team franchise” Snel said. The Golden Knights “were wildly successful.”

As recently as 2016 the NFL NBA and MLB had come together to oppose challenges to the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) which outlawed sports betting nationwide excluding a few states. They were worried about the integrity of the game but the counter from Nevada was that its gaming industry was as well regulated as anywhere else. The Raiders referenced a 2015 study by UNLV international gaming institute executive director Bo Bernhard in their relocation proposal to the NFL.

“Because the regulation of the gambling is so strict and so severe here it’s one of the safest places to do it” former Raiders president Marc Badain said. “It was compelling to us and it was compelling to folks in the NFL. I think that played a big part in changing some people’s archaic beliefs and what was the tie between sports wagering and the sports teams themselves.”

The NFL agreed and on March 27 2017 approved the Raiders’ relocation bid. With the league on board Vegas had officially been stamped as a major sports market. “It’s the entertainment capital of the world” Badain said. “And it’s becoming the sports and entertainment capital of the world.”

With the Aces playing their inaugural season and the Golden Knights going into Year 2 as well as the expansion USL Championship’s Lights FC the Triple-A Las Vegas Aviators UFC and boxing the city continued to make strides as a sports destination in 2018. But the most significant development that year came when the U.S. Supreme Court voted to strike down PASPA that May which opened the door for legalizing gambling nationally.

The same sports leagues that were so strongly opposed to the proliferation of gambling a couple of years prior began to explore ways to profit from it.

“When (PASPA) got repealed everybody wanted to cash in on it” said Stoneback the director of sportsbook trading operations for MGM Resorts International. Through fantasy leagues and sponsorship deals with sportsbooks leagues and teams became directly involved in the industry. And with the influx of media coverage more people started to participate.

“It’s become much more mainstream” Stoneback said. “I remember when PASPA got repealed people were like ‘Boy that’s gonna hurt you guys in Nevada’ but it’s only increased our wagering.”

That increase gave the local economy another lift that carried through 2019 but growth came to a halt in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic brought the entire world to a halt. The NFL had planned for Vegas to host the draft that April ahead of the Raiders’ first season in the city but was forced to postpone. And while the NFL season would be played Mark Davis opted against allowing fans to attend games at Allegiant Stadium. The Raiders’ introduction to Vegas was put on hold.

The Raiders were able to survive losing a season’s worth of ticket sales but many others in an economy driven by tourism and hospitality weren’t so lucky. By April 2020 the city’s unemployment rate had spiked to 30 percent. And while that number came down there was still a concerning trend: From November 2019 to November 2020 unemployment in Vegas jumped from 3.6 percent to 11.5 percent. Entering 2021 the city needed a bounce back in a major way.

The recovery was gradual. In March the Golden Knights became the first local sports team to let spectators back into the arena; they were at full capacity by June. The Aces allowed fans back in May and that August the NFL officially made its debut in front of fans when the Raiders held a scrimmage at Allegiant Stadium in front of about 20000 people. The vision for the evolution of Vegas into a sports hub was finally coming together.

Across nine home games that season the Raiders’ average attendance of 61185 ranked just 26th in the league but they brought in a league-leading $119 million in net ticket revenue according to Sportico. That money didn’t directly funnel into the Vegas economy but it still had an impact through tourist spending and stadium employment.

“It made a difference in the recovery of the city from the pandemic” Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO/president Steve Hill said. “The stadium has performed about twice as well as we would’ve expected from a tourism and economic standpoint. … It is just going to continue to grow this market.”

During the Raiders’ first season the NFL announced that Vegas would host the Pro Bowl the following February the NFL Draft months after that and the Super Bowl in 2024 which will make it the first city to host all three events. The league bestowing its approval has seemingly opened up the door for other high-profile suitors such as Formula 1 which will come to Vegas in 2023 for the first time since the 1980s.

But the NFL’s introduction to Vegas wasn’t all positivity. Head coach Jon Gruden was forced to resign in October after his racist misogynistic and homophobic emails were uncovered during the league’s workplace misconduct investigation into the now-Washington Commanders. And a string of issues raised concerns about the potential dangers of having a franchise in Sin City.

On Nov. 2 2021 second-year receiver Henry Ruggs III the 12th pick in the 2020 draft was involved in a car crash that killed 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her dog. Las Vegas police later revealed that Ruggs was driving at excessive speeds on a residential road — 120 miles per hour at the time of the crash — and that his blood alcohol content was more than twice the legal limit hours after the crash. Ruggs was released by the Raiders and charged with multiple felonies including DUI resulting in death. He is currently awaiting trial.

Less than a week later the team released cornerback Damon Arnette after a video of him brandishing weapons and making threats to an unidentified individual emerged on social media. Just over two months later Arnette was arrested in Vegas on charges of assault with a deadly weapon carrying a concealed weapon without a permit and drug possession.

The consecutive nature of the events led to some hypothesizing about whether living in Vegas made it more likely for athletes to get into trouble and as the Ruggs case showed potentially harm civilians living in the community.

The data is a mixed bag. Vegas has a higher crime rate than most cities in the United States but it lines up pretty similarly compared to other major cities. And while it may not pose greater dangers than cities such as Los Angeles New York or Miami Vegas still stands out from the pack in certain areas. For example BuyAutoInsurance.com ranked it as the most dangerous city in the country for drunk driving with an average of 4311 DUI arrests per year.

“I think there’s a public perception with that but there’s obviously been some problems with some of the young players” Sisolak said. “And I think sometimes what we fail to realize especially people my age is these are kids …

“Yeah there’s a lot of opportunities but every town has opportunities. I think it’s dependent on the coaching and the management to make sure that they make them aware of what those pitfalls could possibly be.”

Badain worked within the Raiders organization for over 30 years before abruptly resigning last year. (Mark Davis revealed a few months later that Badain’s and former Raiders CFO Ed Villanueva’s exits were forced due to “accounting irregularities” that started back when the team was in Oakland.)

While he still worked for the Raiders Badain met Leiweke in the early 2000s and they reconnected through the Adelson family who hired Leiweke as an advisor when the Raiders began to discuss collaborating on a relocation to Vegas. The Adelsons ultimately backed out but Badain and Leiweke stayed in touch. Toward the end of 2021 Leiweke posed a question.

“What if we built the best arena in the business?”

Leiweke had been mulling over the idea for years. He’d seen T-Mobile bring the NHL to Vegas and now he wanted to do the same thing with the NBA. The home of the Golden Knights was built for NBA specifications but Leiweke and Oak View Group (OVG) didn’t want to take a chance that a prospective franchise might not want to share T-Mobile. In their minds bringing the NBA to the city would require yet another arena.

“There’s a lot of people that I know of that want to buy an NBA franchise if one becomes available in Las Vegas” Leiweke said. “We have one or two groups we may be working with and I’m convinced there will be people that will step up if the NBA decides to expand and chase a franchise. But what they need is the certainty of an arena. You can’t have a question mark.”

In partnership with Badain and led by Leiweke OVG announced last March that it planned to erase that question mark with plans to build a $3 billion sports and entertainment center — including a $1 billion 20000-seat arena — near The Strip. The complex which will break ground in 2023 and is set to be completed in 2026 will also include an amphitheater hotel and casino.

Like Leiweke’s first arena project in the city — and other projects of his throughout the country — the new arena is being constructed before landing a commitment from a franchise. It seems risky but those behind the project similarly believe the complex can sustain itself through live entertainment and events. They know they can’t assume the NBA will come.

“There are no guarantees the NBA is coming and that’s been made very clear” Leiweke said. “So what you gotta do is go build (the arena) and make it work on everything else. My guess is they’ll get more interested and fascinated by Vegas if there is a world-class billion-dollar arena.”

The hope is that the arena will at very least house the Summer League preseason games and NCAA basketball games and tournaments. The MSG Sphere at The Venetian a 17500-seat auditorium scheduled to open in 2023 will be competition for music and entertainment events so Oak View views it as instrumental for their arena to have some sort of sports element.

“The goal and Tim has done it before is to build a venue that’s ready for these tenants to program it with strategic partners that he’s already done business with in the past and to build the next arena for Las Vegas” Badain said. “It’s time.”

Leiweke has taken a similar approach in other cities. He helped build the Sprint Center in Kansas City in 2007 with hopes of landing an NBA or NHL franchise though none came. But OVG’s $1.15 billion redevelopment of Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena — formerly KeyArena — is already home to the NHL’s Kraken and is the most logical landing spot if an NBA franchise were to return to the city.

“The day (the NBA) makes a decision they can turn around and start playing up there tomorrow” Leiweke said. “It’s wise for us to do that in Vegas as well. It does not mean we’re gonna get one but it does put us in a better position in case they decide to expand.”

Late NBA commissioner David Stern made annual visits to Vegas for Summer League and current commissioner Adam Silver has followed suit. Sisolak who assumed office as Nevada governor in 2019 has been having conversations with NBA leadership over the last decade. He can’t be certain but he’s optimistic about the league coming to the city.

“I talked to Roger Goodell three or four times since the draft and he was just astounded at how well it came off” said Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. (Jeff Speer / Getty Images)

A much more immediate development is the potential relocation of MLB’s Oakland A’s whose lease at the Oakland Coliseum is set to expire following the 2024 season. The club has threatened to relocate if Oakland doesn’t approve plans to build a new stadium.

The Aviators have been their Triple-A affiliate since 2019 and Sisolak has been in active conversations with A’s owner John Fisher. The club has explored parcels of land in Vegas and could theoretically play at the Aviators’ Las Vegas Ballpark while a new stadium was being built.

“I think they gotta pull the trigger and say ‘Look we’re gonna move or not move'” Sisolak said. “The town is ready for them.”

The tricky part? Like their former Oakland neighbors the A’s would be aiming for a public contribution toward building a new stadium. Considering the city just committed $750 million to do the same for the Raiders it could be difficult to get that legislation to pass.

“I know everyone is kind of gung-ho about the baseball and the Oakland Athletics; I’m not really drinking the Kool-Aid until there’s like a public-funding source for a baseball park” Snel the LVSportzBiz founder said. “If there is a sizable public subsidy for a baseball park then I think the Oakland Athletics would have a crack at the Las Vegas market.”

Major League Soccer is another league in the mix. It’s aiming to add a 30th team through expansion and commissioner Don Garber called Vegas the “frontrunner” to land that prospective franchise last December. And while an independent soccer stadium would need to be constructed — Cashman Field home to Lights FC won’t cut it — the MLS has held multiple matches at Allegiant Stadium the last couple of years.

It seems clear it’s a matter of when not if more leagues are coming to Vegas. The city has arrived as a national — and international — sports hub. The only question that remains is how big it can get.

“These are the early years” Leiweke said. “I don’t think we’re at the end of this cycle; I think we’re at the beginning.”

Of the 25 items Russia is seeking most desperately almost all are microchips manufactured by U.S. firms Marvell Intel Holt ISSI Microchip Micron Broadcom and Texas Instruments. Rounding out the list are chips by Japanese firm Renesas which acquired the U.S.-based IDT; Germany's Infineon which acquired U.S.-based Cypress; microcircuits by American firm Vicor; and connectors by U.S. firm AirBorn. Some of the items can be easily found in online electronics retailers while others have been out of stock for months as a result of the global microchip shortage.

The cheapest item on the top priority list the 88E1322-AO-BAM2I000 gigabit ethernet transceiver made by Marvell can apparently be sourced by Moscow for 430.83 rubles a piece or around €7. The most expensive item a 10M04DCF256I7G field programmable gate array made by Intel can be sourced at a highly inflated 66815.77 rubles or €1107 each according to the list (before the chips shortage it would have cost under €20).

When it comes to the medium priority list companies including Germany's Harting and the Netherlands' Nexperia (which was acquired by Chinese tech firm Wingtech in 2019) feature heavily. The Russians are hunting for a range of Harting's casings and connectors the list showed including the 09 03 000 6201 and the 09 03 000 6104 as well as Nexperia/NXP's 74LVC1G14GV125 inverters and 74LVC244APW112 octal buffer/line drivers.

James Byrne director of open source intelligence and analysis at leading defense and security think tank RUSI said it's likely that Russia has been buying up stock of Western microchips and other essential equipment for years but could now be running low.

The Russian military procurement program is ""extensive it’s well funded and they have a huge military and industrial base producing stuff"" said Byrne. ""But now they’ve expended so much of it in Ukraine they need a large volume of new supplies. And the sanctions are going to make it more difficult for them ... So they’re going to have to prioritize critical things and that’s why we’re seeing these documents. We obviously think they are scrambling to secure supplies.""

Holes in the blockade

Since its latest invasion of Ukraine in February Western countries have tightened sanctions on Russia increasingly targeting its supply chains of microchips to decrease its military capabilities. The new sanctions come on top of years of stricter controls of chips sales — which often fall under ""dual-use goods"" because they're used in military and civilian applications alike — under international agreements like the Wassenaar Arrangement as well as recent EU law.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtrdHYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDUvdGhpcy1tYW4taXMtdGFraW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaW50by1oaXMtb3duLWhhbmRzLWxpdGVyYWxseS_SAWpodHRwczovL3d3dy5ra3R2LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA1L3RoaXMtbWFuLWlzLXRha2luZy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWludG8taGlzLW93bi1oYW5kcy1saXRlcmFsbHkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This man is taking technology into his own hands – literally,"DETROIT Mich. (WXYZ) – A man in Michigan is using implanted chips in his hand to start his car and unlock his home.

In the near future he’ll use them to replace his wallet.

“It’s not just a Tesla key you are able to have it be a secure crypto storage wallet” Brandon Dalaly said. “I can at some point in the future do credit card transactions of it at some point in time.”

The 41-year-old has a microchip about the size of a small paper clip implanted sub-dermally in his right hand.

A piercer implanted the chip for $100 which according to Dalaly doesn’t impact his day-to-day activities and most people don’t even notice it.

This wasn’t Dalaly’s first implant. He has one in each hand. One starts his car while the other opens the door to his home and can pull up his medical records when needed.

His goal is to lead a life without having to carry keys and a wallet.

“This is something I’m doing for me. It doesn’t affect anybody else” Dalaly said. “I’m not saying this technology is for everybody. I’m saying in the future you might start to see more of these things. It could possibly save someone’s life.”

Dalaly is planning a third implant to monitor his vitals like his body temperature.

Following record demands for its memory and storage products Micron (not for the first time) became the first chipmaker to begin volume production of the world’s first 232-layer NAND at the company’s Singapore fabrication plant or fab.

Tech Wire Asia took the opportunity to speak with Nagasubramaniyan (Naga) Chandrasekaran the Senior Vice President of Technology Development at Micron on this significant technological achievement as well as to tour the impressive Singapore fab including notably Micron’s gleaming FAB10N clean room and Remote Operations Centre (ROC).

For the uninitiated NAND is a type of flash memory that relies on electric circuitry to store data even without an external power source. Once power is detached from NAND flash memory a metal-oxide semiconductor continues to supply an extra charge to the memory cell storing data intact. Ever since data storage started going fully digital and requiring hardware merely to house the flash memory NAND has become the popular choice to store large files that can be frequently uploaded and replaced – which is why MP3 players digital cameras and USB flash drives all utilize NAND memory.

Since Micron’s initial announcement other fabricators have revealed their own 232-layer NAND but Micron is the first to go to production with this highest-layer NAND wholly manufactured at the Singapore plant which is also Micron’s NAND Center of Excellence that has been hailed by the World Economic Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network for operational excellence in smart manufacturing.

“So very proud of this one the 232-layer where we were the first ones to announce this. But more than the announcement it’s in my opinion significantly ahead by months in terms of productization and being already running in volume here in Singapore” enthused Naga commenting how certain 232-layer NAND components are already being sold in the market through Micron’s crucial SSD channel along with shipping samples to electronics customers.

This is not the first time that Micron has broken the NAND innovation mould either – Micron was also first to market with the 176-layer NAND the pinnacle of NAND layers that was the industry benchmark at the time. “And I tell our teams also that it’s not just a one-shot wonder right like when the 176-layer came out Micron announced first and it shocked the industry” Naga confirmed.

“And then now with 232 it’s two in a row [industry firsts] that we are able to get. And it’s all because of the innovation that’s happening with the Micron team members and also the role that Singapore is playing in our NAND portfolio.”

Micron’s Singapore facilities were first established more than two decades ago when the semiconductor specialists acquired Texas Instruments and today employs over 8000 team members (Micron employees are all called team members and the company has been repeatedly recognized as a Great Place to Work in Singapore).

Naga himself has been with Micron since 2001 and has been coming to the Singapore operation since 2003. As an industrial trailblazer Micron has been heavily involved in many innovations from storage hardware to smart manufacturing breakthroughs to running one of the most automated and precise Remote Operations Centers in the world – but Naga counts having once again shipped a first-of-its-kind NAND deployment fully researched and manufactured out of the Singapore among his proudest achievements.

“I’m very proud of the innovation that happens across the semiconductor industry – of course Micron but across the semiconductor industry – a lot of the fundamental mechanisms we understand” he noted.

“But there’s five years of R&D behind getting one of these products out into the market right five-plus years. And that’s the five-plus years where fundamentals modelling with some empirical work that we are doing on the silicon all of those together is how you get to these pieces” summarized Naga before adding “Of course it’s all people eventually. People have to come up with the innovations and ideas.”

How big of a breakthrough is the 232-layer NAND in actual fact? It all lies in Micron’s layers and six-plane architecture. When it comes to memory hardware its about maximizing the space on the board to incrementally optimize efficiencies. Built upon industry-leading pioneering technologies in its 176-layer NAND not only does the 232-layer possess the highest layer count it also spits out the most bits-per-millimeters-squared and generates the fastest input/output read speeds in its class.

Naga says that with the right architecture and process changes along with the likewise industry-first six-plane one terabit device “we can get 200% write bandwidth improvement and a 75% read bandwidth improvement” in contrast with the previous generation technology node.

“Us coders like to say it’s like a supermarket where you have one lane you can consider it as one plane. But now we have increased the number of lanes which is the sixth plane it allows you more checkout lanes to come out” he elaborates. “And then on top of it now we have a higher data transfer. So more people can get through each link we are able to put push more data back and forth through this.”

“All of this means our latency is going to be really fast and how we can move the data around. And it’s going to give some energy efficiency as a result. So those are some pretty good numbers.” And since its physical capacity or density is what will determine how efficient fast and how much better latency will be improved Naga went on:

“Compared to things in the market other competitors it’s anywhere between 35-to-100% more bits in terms of density that we are able to get. But we are doing that in a much smaller footprint. So this is 11.5 by 13.5-millimeter square package. And that’s a 28% reduction in the site size. So now we can get a lot more areal density and a much smaller size with better performance. All of this is really getting us to the fast storage better latency and efficiency.”

So for devices like laptops and flagship smartphones the memory performance output is going to be much higher but with a smaller footprint lower rate and much higher density. “And that’s going with the cost reduction the performance is actually going to give more storage for the moment. But then power is going to be lower in terms of the total read-write energy is going to be better. And that’s going to give you better battery life.”

Not just the consumer spaces will see sizable benefits but in commercial applications from on-premises storage to the automotive industry to software applications. “Now because of the higher density and the form factor for the same footprint we can put more than [one terabit in a NAND package]. As a result the data center applications for AI (artificial intelligence) or ML (machine learning) can have a lot more storage. We have more storage with better data transfer rate. You can get to much more real-time data and much better storage.”

Micron has been accelerating performance efficiencies in its NAND and other products — by accelerating efficiencies in its R&D operational processes and its smart manufacturing processes with a combination of intelligent data analytics and equipment enhancements that leverage cutting-edge robotic process automation and intelligent machinery that leverage AI to predict space optimization. Its FAB10N clean room where the ultra-sensitive wafers are assembled with precision and speed is one of the cleanest in the world.

“It’s not just the technology but all the AI aspects that we are doing here. That’s helping us to improve the yield aspects faster we don’t want to just run wafers without improving the yield” elaborates Naga. “So we are doing a lot of machine learning data analytics using data science to actually improve our yield improve our equipment productivity so that we can drive better operational efficiency in the factory.”

This sort of full-circle dependency on harnessing high-end technology to build more sophisticated technology with precision speed and efficiency in mind is why Micron Singapore was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Global Lighthouse for Industry 4.0 operational excellence.

“In fact Singapore factory is the first semiconductor fab to be recognized for Industry 4.0 – we put a lot of effort into AI/ML. That’s why I say memory and storage are enabling AI/ML [innovation]” emphasizes Naga. “Without it we cannot get real-time data analytics and all the edge applications that we are running.

“But then the circle is completed when we use the same AI/ML solutions to improve our memory technology – performance yield cost everything. So it really has come full circle.”

The demand for Indian-Americans as CEOs of multinationals has rekindled new interest in their multicultural exposure and dedication to drive the growth of a global company reflecting in several studies being undertaken in management schools.

A report stated that seven top companies currently headed by them earned over $530 billion in 2020 greater than the GDP of all but 40 countries.

The situation was different three decades ago when there were very few Indian Americans in the top echelons of corporate America until the glass ceiling was broken in the mid-1990s by Raj Gupta Ramani Ayer and Rakesh Gangwal and Sanjay Mehrotra.

Gupta served as the Chairman and CEO of Rohm & Haas which was later acquired by Dow Chemicals for more than a decade.

Ayer served as the CEO and Chairman of The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. from 1997 to 2009. Gangwal was the president and CEO of the US Airways Group from 1998 to 2001.

Then in 2001 PepsiCo named Indra Nooyi as its CEO and she became the first Indian American woman to head a Fortune 100 company.

Six years later Vikram Pandit would start his tenure as CEO at Citigroup. Today Indian Americans hold top-level positions in as many US companies across a spectrum of industries.

The following is a list of ten Indian American CEOs who are leading some top US companies.

Prior to being appointed CTO Agrawal had risen to be Twitter’s first ‘Distinguished Engineer’ due to his work across revenue and consumer engineering including his impact on the re-acceleration of audience growth in 2016 and 2017.

Agrawal holds a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University and a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLmNvbS9zZW5zb3JzL2NoaXAtbGVhZC10aW1lcy01Mi13ZWVrcy1leHBlY3RlZC1sYXN0LWZldy15ZWFycy1yYW5kLWV4cGVydC1zYXlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip lead times of 52 weeks expected to last a few years Rand expert says,"While the US CHIPS Act provides $52 billion for domestic chip manufacturing and research it will be years before ambitious plans for expensive fabs built by Intel Micron and others reach the chip production stage.

The Act goes a long way to start bringing back manufacturing to the US now down to 12% of global production according to advocates.

However the chip shortage first seen a few months into the pandemic in 2020 isn’t going away according to Jennifer Strawn head of sourcing for the Americas and EMEA for Rand Technology a global component sourcing company for more than 30 years.

In a recent interview with Fierce Electronics she said average lead times to place an order for a chip and receive it have increased to 52 weeks compared to eight to 12 weeks prior to the pandemic in 2020.

She warned chip customers that “anything short of 52 weeks lead time is expected to last for several years.”

After the awareness of a chip shortage sunk in early in 2021 major companies such as Texas Instruments Nvidia and Micron decided to change their planning approach to have a sufficient supply. “In order to get their head around it and gauge demand they had to decide what was real demand” Strawn said.

Some companies entered NCNR orders meaning non-cancelable and non-reschedulable with suppliers but in the early part of 2022 they weren’t sure when chip delivery would come which led to buying on the open market. For OEMs that process of open market buying on top of NCNRs often led to too much inventory which is one reason companies supplying chips are now reporting low demand into coming quarters.

“It’s a butterfly effect” Strawn said.

In a sense the pandemic had a positive impact because it has forced companies to rethink their supply chain strategies. Ultimately that could prove to be a good thing.

“Yes Covid has been a catalyst for how we needed to have the right mindset with risk mitigation and supply assurance” Strawn said. “The thinking was to lean into suppliers and you’ll have the strongest chance of navigating through uncharted waters and what is the right supply. The road is still not clear but the path is being carved.”

Chip companies are also facing trade embargoes and global inflation affecting demand and a continuing war in Ukraine. The most vivid example of a potential shortage is with neon produced in Ukraine used by various fabs in the chipmaking process. Many chip producers already had plenty of neon before the war broke out in February but as the war continues shortages of neon “could be very problematic in 2023” Strawn warned.

“Every day geopolitics become more heated and are going to pose ongoing disruptions as electronics companies think about strategies and products and components” Strawn said. “It shows more than ever the importance of steps being taken to bring fabs to the U.S. so geopolitical issues don’t become so devastating.”

Microsoft is planning to discontinue its Scheduler service for Microsoft 365 on Sept. 1 2023 according to a note posted to its Office Message Center. However officials are saying the company ""may bundle some of these [Scheduler] features with another offering in the future.""



Scheduler is the service formerly known as Calendar.help. It enables Cortana to act as the front end for scheduling meetings with people outside of a user's organization. Microsoft began rolling out Scheduler in English across Microsoft 365 accounts in June 2021 a year later than it originally expected (as a result of effects from the COVID-19 pandemic officials said).

Also: How to get Microsoft Office for free

Scheduler allows users to use natural-language queries such as ""Find a time for Paul and me to meet for breakfast next week"" to schedule their meetings. The backend service looks up attendee availability and goes back and forth over email before sending calendar invitations. Scheduler can also reschedule and cancel meetings.

Scheduler has been available as an add-on to many Microsoft 365 licenses with a Microsoft Exchange Online plan. Scheduler costs $10 per user per month with an annual commitment and $12 per user per month if paid monthly. Volume and partner discounts are available and there also has been a 30-day standard free trial for Scheduler.



Microsoft's Message Center note about the coming cancellation of Scheduler doesn't say why the company is dropping the service. My guess would be lack of use especially given the way Cortana largely has disappeared from Microsoft's radar screen. Microsoft also offers a similar service for Outlook called FindTime.



Microsoft announced late last month that it plans to drop its Kaizala group-messaging service in September 2023. Again officials didn't say exactly why though lack of use could be the reason. Microsoft officials also just may be cleaning house and dropping lesser-used services as a way to save money given the Windows and Office divisions are doing a bit of belt-tightening as of late.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9yZWZpbmUtc2VhcmNoLWNyaXRlcmlhLW91dGxvb2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to refine search criteria for more efficient searching in Microsoft Outlook,"Many of us spend a lot of time with Microsoft Outlook. That’s because there’s a lot to do and many of us organize our entire day in Outlook. That’s why efficient searching is so important. “I couldn’t find the email with the bid process” isn’t a good way to start a meeting. Fortunately Outlook offers many ways to limit or broaden an email search.

SEE: Windows Linux and Mac commands everyone needs to know (free PDF) (TechRepublic)

In this tutorial I’ll show you how to improve search strings to get the most efficient results when searching for specific email messages. I’m using Microsoft 365 Desktop on a Windows 10 64-bit system but you can use earlier versions of Microsoft Outlook.

How to apply a simple search in Microsoft Outlook

Outlook’s Search control in the title bar is the search tool in all windows. To start a search click the control and enter a search string. Outlook will return a list of items that contain the search string or some part of the search string. By honing that search string you can improve the results.

When you click the search control Outlook displays a list of suggested searches based on your recent searches. To the left you’ll see a dropdown that lets you limit the search to specific mailboxes and folders. This dropdown is available only when the search control has the focus.

The dropdown is the first stop for searching more efficiently. You can limit or broaden the search by specifying where to look. The current mailbox is the default. You don’t want to look in all mailboxes if you know the message you’re searching for is in a specific mailbox. Similarly you don’t want to limit a search to one mailbox when you think there may be matches in other mailboxes or even if you’re unsure.

How to apply Outlook searches more efficiently

Now let’s look at the search string possibilities. It’s important to note that Outlook scans email messages and attachments for the search string.

If a search string contains more than one word such as Susan Harkins Outlook will find all matches to Susan and Harkins including Susanne Susan Jones and Dan Harkins.

When searching for messages from a particular person enter their email address. For instance if you enter jane.doe@domain.com Outlook will list any message that contains jane.doe@domain.com in the:

To control

Subject control

Body of the message

Attachments

That’s a lot of places to search. To limit those results add from to the search string as follows:

from:jane.doe@domain.com

Doing so will list only messages received from Jane Doe.

If the Subject text is your search such as “Team Planning Meeting Agenda for Review” limiting the string to a few keywords will yield the best results. If you enter the full Subject text Outlook will list every message that contains any of those worlds in the To and Subject fields in the body of the message and in an attachment. A few better search strings are “Planning Meeting” “Meeting Agenda” or even just “Review.”

A few more search rules to consider follow:

Outlook doesn’t consider punctuation.

Outlook returns only the first 250 items to match the search string.

Outlook doesn’t respond well if the search string includes more than one language. Results are hit or miss.

Beside textual search strings Outlook also evaluates operators in a search string.

How to use operators correctly in Outlook

You’re probably familiar with operators such as AND NOT OR and so on. You can use operators to refine a search. When using operators in Outlook you should always use uppercase letters. Table A lists the most common uses of operators and a few other reserved search terms.

Table A

Operator Search string Result AND Susan AND Harkins Will return all items that contain Susan and Harkins. It won’t list items that contain only Susan or only Harkins. OR Susan OR Harkins Will return all items that contain either Susan or Harkins and Susan Harkins. NOT Susan NOT Harkins Will return all items containing Susan but not Harkins. """" ""Susan"" Will match Susan but not Susanne. about about: “Team Meeting” Will list messages only with “Team Meeting” in the subject body or attachment. from about from: “Susan Harkins” about: “Team Meeting” Will list messages only from Susan Harkins with “Team Meeting” in the subject. subject subject: “Team Meeting” Will list messages only with “Team Meeting” in the subject.

Searching in Outlook has lots of possibilities. If there’s a field you can search it simply by expressing it by field name followed by a colon. For instance if you’re searching contacts you might use the search string lastname: “Harkins” to list only those contacts where Harkins is their last name. With a little thought you can refine search terms to yield the best results."

The new shots from Pfizer and Moderna are bivalent meaning that they target both the original Covid strain and omicron's BA.5 subvariant. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease and Control Prevention approved Pfizer's updated booster for people ages 12 and older and Moderna's updated shot for people ages 18 and older.

To be eligible you'll need to have completed your primary vaccination series — and be at least two months out from your last dose of any Covid vaccine according to the CDC. The agency's advisors also say that if you've recently had Covid you should consider waiting three months after testing negative before getting your updated booster.

The new shots are free of charge to receive for now. Here's where you can get them if you're eligible:

Walgreens is offering both Pfizer and Moderna's new boosters. The shots haven't reached all of the chain's locations yet but new appointments are being added daily. You can view and schedule appointments on the Walgreens website on the pharmacy's app or by calling 1-800-WALGREENS.

CVS is also offering both updated boosters. Its online system allows you to schedule multiple patients at once which could make it easier for your family to get vaccinated together. You can schedule those appointments on the CVS website or on the pharmacy's app.

Rite Aid which also owns Pacific Northwest chain Bartell Drugs began offering both Pfizer and Moderna's new boosters last week at some of its store locations. You can schedule an appointment on the Rite Aid website or the Bartell Drugs website.

Albertsons one of North America's largest grocery chains started offering Pfizer and Moderna's updated boosters at some of its locations on Monday — along with a coupon for 10% off your next grocery purchase if you get the shot. The company's brands offering the boosters include Albertsons Safeway Vons Jewel-Osco Shaw's Acme Tom Thumb Randalls United Supermarkets Pavilions Star Market Haggen Carrs Amigos and Market Street. You can view and schedule appointments on the Albertsons website or app.

Multiple states — including Massachusetts New Jersey and Colorado — have websites to help you find other clinics with new boosters in stock. Check your state's health department website to see if it's offering similar resources.

Vaccines.gov has a search filter for the ""newly authorized bivalent"" booster options which you can use to find other locations near you. The website says that if you can't find a convenient location you should check back later or contact your local health department or health care provider.

Walgreens' online scheduling tool makes it clear that a location is offering the ""updated booster."" Other pharmacies and clinics including CVS don't necessarily specify — but any booster shot you receive now will be the new one according to recent FDA guidance.

That's because when the FDA authorized the new boosters it also changed its authorization for the original ""monovalent"" vaccines that have been used since December 2020. Those original shots can't be used as booster doses for people 12 and over anymore though they're still the only primary vaccine options for unvaccinated people.

More than 200 million people are eligible for the new shots a CDC official said earlier this month. The Biden administration secured 171 million doses of the new boosters including 105 million from Pfizer and 66 million from Moderna ahead of the boosters' approvals — an indicator that the country's supply of free doses will likely meet demand from the general public.

If you can't find an appointment now don't worry: The doses are still being shipped out to vaccine sites across the country. Appointment availability will likely ramp up in the coming days and weeks.

Update: This story has been updated to reflect updated booster availability at Rite Aid Albertsons and Vaccines.gov.

Because Pfizer and Moderna hold the patents for the current vaccines researchers would likely have to get the companies’ permission to use them for research into products like nasal or pan-coronavirus vaccines. Right now Pfizer isn’t sharing its vaccines for research purposes a spokesperson confirmed to STAT. Moderna didn’t comment when we asked.

Pfizer’s stance is legal and in line with the company’s commercial interests said Ana Santos Rutschman a professor of law at Villanova University.

“If you use this thing that has been patented what you’re doing doesn’t matter. Even if you’re trying to cure cancer the law is pretty rigid” she said.

But some university researchers argue the posture slows global progress toward more effective vaccines in the future especially since the United States has already wasted tens of millions of doses of the Covid-19 vaccines.

Yale University virologist and immunologist Akiko Iwasaki has designed a study of nasal vaccines against Covid-19 which she argues could provide better protection against infection and transmission than shots alone. The ideal study would be conducted on subjects that have already had a primary vaccine series to simulate real-world scenarios. She inquired with Pfizer about obtaining some vaccine to use in her study of nasal vaccines but has not received any.

“In order for us to develop a better vaccine we need a comparator. For that reason everyone who’s doing research in this area is in the same boat we don’t have access to do a comparison” Iwasaki said.

Iwasaki brought the issue up briefly at the White House’s summit on the future of Covid vaccines on July 26 and presidential science adviser Francis Collins said at the time that he “would not have thought of that” hurdle.

California Institute of Technology professor Pamela Bjorkman said her lab has had similar troubles obtaining existing Covid-19 vaccines that would otherwise be discarded in order to research a vaccine candidate that could provide protection against a variety of Covid-19 variants.

“Whatever policy prevents using such vials does a great disservice to global efforts to develop new and improved vaccines” Bjorkman said.

When asked whether Pfizer has provided any vaccines for research purposes spokesperson Sharon Castillo said “We are not accepting or reviewing applications for possible clinical research that studies the Covid-19 vaccine.”

Another Pfizer spokesperson also said the company has its own “extensive studies” of the vaccine underway and will continue to share information from those studies as it becomes available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2NpZW5jZWJhc2VkbWVkaWNpbmUub3JnL3BlZXItcmV2aWV3LWZhaWwtdmFjY2luZS1wdWJsaXNoZXMtYW50aXZheC1wcm9wYWdhbmRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peer review fail: Vaccine publishes antivax propaganda disguised as “reanalyses” of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 ...,"Shares

While contemplating the lessons thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic I cannot help but emphasize how starkly the pandemic has revealed the shortcomings in scientific publishing. Before the pandemic I expected to see poorly designed studies designed to stoke fear about vaccines by exaggerating adverse reactions (or even making them up) only in bottom-feeding and predatory journals and generally viewed it as a rare to nonexistent occurrence to see such papers published in reputable journals. Obviously the publication of Andrew Wakefield’s fraudulent case series linking the MMR vaccines to “autistic enterocolitis” published in The Lancet in 1998 was one huge exception but in general reputable journals did not traffic in what I like to refer to antivaccine disinformation disguised as legitimate scientific studies. Since the pandemic there has been one exception The BMJ  which has published enough dodgy vaccine articles that I once asked “What the heck happened to The BMJ ?” My post was in response to a deceptive “exposé” by Paul Thacker published in The BMJ about Ventavia Research Group a Texas contract research organization (CRO) subcontracted by Pfizer to run three out of its 153 clinical trial sites for its COVID-19 vaccine trial in 2020. Thacker’s report was based on a single “whistleblower” briefly employed at Ventavia but with little to no actual evidence of alleged data falsification patient unblinding and worse with Thacker attempting to generalize these problems (again without evidence) to the entire Pfizer clinical trial. In my post I also listed a number of other examples of The BMJ ‘s failures with respect to reports and studies on vaccines a pattern that unfortunately did predate the pandemic and has been traceable to one of its editors Peter Doshi who has a long history of antivaccine-adjacent and outright antivaccine stylings going back at least to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Indeed one of his “reanalyses” resulted in what I like to call the “slasher lie” about the Pfizer vaccine that it is only 12-19% effective against COVID-19.

Last week Peter Doshi managed to expand his penchant for deceptive “reanalyses” to Vaccine  one of the foremost journals about vaccine science in a study titled “Serious adverse events of special interest following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in randomized trials in adults“. The article had previously made a huge splash in antivaccine social media in June as a preprint where its PlumX Metrics showed (as of yesterday) over 584000 abstract views over 109000 downloads and over 29000 Tweets about it with its download rank being 7th for the SSRN preprint site. Now that the paper whose flaws and misleading nature were discussed in great detail by many scientists (which I will discuss in a moment) as well as by our very own Dr. Jonathan Howard and Dr. Harriet Hall has somehow inexplicably gone from preprint to peer-reviewed publication in Vaccine  the onslaught started again. Here are some examples:

Does this one look familiar? It’s Dr. Joseph Ladapo the Florida Surgeon General who was previously a member of the COVID-19 minimizing “natural immunity” touting hydroxychloroquine– and ivermectin-pushing antivax quacks known as America’s Frontline Doctors before being tapped by Governor Ron DeSantis to be his Surgeon General.

Here are some more. Here’s the study’s first author:

Who in response to criticism said:

Seriously peer review isn’t some magical talisman that makes a bad paper “science”. I like to paraphrase Winston Churchill about democracy by saying about peer review that it has been said that peer review is the worst method of deciding what should be published in the scientific literature except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.

In particular they cited this “finding” from the paper which reinforces an antivax narrative that the vaccine is more dangerous than the disease:

The study was also misrepresented as being an “independent” randomized controlled clinical trial when in fact it was merely a “reanalysis” of the trial using different definitions of adverse events:

Moderna – the excess risk of serious AESIs (15.1 per 10000) vs placebo group (6.4 per 10000)

Then of course there were the conspiracy theories about a “coverup”:

Unfortunately as we approach 2 years after release of COVID-19 vaccines participant level data remain inaccessible.“ Peter Doshi https://t.co/4LwJzLERoo — Andreas Falk (@andifalk) September 4 2022

I rather regret not writing about this study before here at SBM  back when it was a preprint (although Jonathan and Harriet did). Its having managed to go from preprint to actual publication in a usually-reputable peer-reviewed vaccine journal provides me the opportunity to rectify that oversight examine how the manuscript changed from preprint to publication and discuss from my perspective exactly why this paper is a huge flaming dumpster fire. Finally I’ll ask how a highly eminent statistician (Sander Greenland) one whose work on Bayesian statistics both retired SBM contributor Kimball Atwood and I have cited before in talks and blog posts sullied his name by associating itself with this exercise in revisionist science. It turns out that there’s history there dating back 14 years that I had totally forgotten about. Worse I strongly suspect that there’s no way Vaccine would have published this dreck had Prof. Greenland not put his name on it.

Strap in this is a long one even for me (although not my longest ever by far).

The Vaccine article: from preprint to peer-reviewed article

Let’s follow the path from preprint to peer-reviewed article in Vaccine . The first thing I wondered when I read the preprint for the first time is more of a meta issue specifically: Why was this study even done in the first place? In the introduction to the preprint Fraiman et al. wrote:

We sought to investigate the association between FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and serious adverse events identified by the Brighton Collaboration using data from the phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials on which authorization was based. We then use the results to illustrate the need for formal harm-benefit analyses of the vaccines that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes as well as contextualize the findings against post-authorization observational data.

What is the Brighton Collaborative? (I’m actually surprised that I hadn’t heard of it before.) It’s a group dedicated to vaccine safety and improving the scientific rigor of vaccine science. Learning that to be honest made me a bit annoyed at some criticisms of the study that the serious adverse events (SAEs) had been pulled out of someone’s nether regions. That the Brighton Collaborative is involved doesn’t absolve Doshi for his chicanery in this paper but we should be careful regarding criticisms we make.

Back to my meta question though: Why does this study exist? I’ll preface my answer by pointing out a simple observation. It’s been 21 months since the randomized clinical trial (RCT) results for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were first reported. Both of them involved only ~43K and ~30K participants respectively. Next I will point out that even large randomized clinical trials used to approve drugs and vaccines miss less common adverse events (AEs) including serious AEs (SAEs). That’s why we do postmarketing surveillance studies particularly for vaccines. Less common AEs sometimes don’t show up until after a vaccine is rolled out and distribution goes from a population of tens of thousands to administration to millions tens of millions hundreds of millions and even billions as has happened with the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines over the last 21 months. In other words if you are truly interested in the actual real-world safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines right here right now in September 2022 then the original RCT data are not the best data to use to estimate rates of adverse events. After all well over 12 billion doses have been administered since then and numerous countries have safety and efficacy data. Say what you will about Peter Doshi’s “reanalysis” of the clinical trial data in January 2021 that falsely concluded that the Pfizer vaccine had only demonstrated 19% efficacy in January 2021 the randomized clinical trial data for the vaccine was all that there was. It made sense to look at those data then. Today? Not nearly as much.

So given that background why reanalyze the original RCT results from Pfizer and Moderna at all now? There’s one reason and one reason only that scientists might want to reanalyze data from a completed and long ago published clinical trial and that’s if they suspect some sort of serious flaw in the RCT design or how the RCT was carried out. They might even suspect outright fraud. Doshi and his colleagues don’t explicitly say this but if you know Doshi’s history you’ll understand that the real reason he undertook this analysis was almost certainly because he thought that the RCTs for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine didn’t show what they claimed to show and were analyzed in such a way to exaggerate efficacy and hide adverse events. It’s not as though he’s made a secret of this belief given that he’s a senior editor at The BMJ who’s been allowed to use the journal as his own soapbox to argue just that going back to January 2021.

Interestingly this paragraph underwent some…changes…in the final version published in Vaccine :

We sought to investigate the association between FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and serious adverse events identified by the Brighton Collaboration using data from the phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials on which authorization was based. We consider these trial data against findings from post-authorization observational safety data. Our study was not designed to evaluate the overall harm-benefit of vaccination programs so far. To put our safety results in context we conducted a simple comparison of harms with benefits to illustrate the need for formal harm-benefit analyses of the vaccines that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. Our analysis is restricted to the randomized trial data and does not consider data on post-authorization vaccination program impact. It does however show the need for public release of participant level trial datasets.

I note that in the first paragraph a sentence was added touting the Brighton Collaborative as a “a global authority on the topic of vaccine safety”. In any event it’s tempting for me to claim that because a paragraph was revised from preprint to paper in order to tone it down that means I can dismiss everything in the preprint. After all “lab leak” conspiracy theorists did exactly the same thing recently based on the removal of a single word from a preprint to finished paper. I will however refrain and note again that most likely peer reviewers demanded that Fraiman et al. tone it down.

There’s another “tell” in the Methods section regarding what this study is really about:

Pfizer and Moderna each submitted the results of one phase III randomized trial in support of the FDA’s emergency use authorization of their vaccines in adults. Two reviewers (PD and RK) searched journal publications and trial data on the FDA’s and Health Canada’s websites to locate serious adverse event results tables for these trials. The Pfizer and Moderna trials are expected to follow participants for two years. Within weeks of the emergency authorization however the sponsors began a process of unblinding all participants who elected to be unblinded. In addition those who received placebo were offered the vaccine. These self-selection processes may have introduced nonrandom differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants thus rendering the post-authorization data less reliable. Therefore to preserve randomization we used the interim datasets that were the basis for emergency authorization in December 2020 approximately 4 months after trials commenced. The definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) was provided in each trial’s study protocol and included in the supplemental material of the trial’s publication. [2] [3] [4] Pfizer and Moderna used nearly identical definitions consistent with regulatory expectations. An SAE was defined as an adverse event that results in any of the following conditions: death; life-threatening at the time of the event; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; medically important event based on medical judgment.

Here Doshi is echoing a common antivax talking point in which it is claimed that the unblinding was carried out to hide AEs and much lower efficacy than reported based on the data used to obtain EUAs for the vaccines. Of course the question of whether or not to unblind a clinical trial is a complex issue and depends on the intersection of bioethics and science. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines after efficacy and safety were demonstrated in the first analyses it became unethical to leave the control groups of those studies unprotected against COVID-19 which was surging around the world and causing mass illness disability and death. I won’t go into more detail as I discussed the issue of unblinding the trials in detail over a year ago. Moreover multiple assessments of the trials have concluded that both were rigorously conducted.

To accomplish the task of making the vaccines look bad instead of looking at all AEs as the papers and reports analyzing the data from the clinical trials did Doshi and his colleagues decided to focus on “serious adverse events of special interest” (AESIs). The first version of this list was published early in the pandemic based on five reports from China and has undergone a total of four updates the most recent of which was published last September. These SAEs were determined in the following manner described by Fraiman et al.:

We used an AESI list derived from the work of Brighton Collaboration’s Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) Project. This project created an AESI list which categorizes AESIs into three categories: those included because they are seen with COVID-19 those with a proven or theoretical association with vaccines in general and those with proven or theoretical associations with specific vaccine platforms. The first version was produced in March 2020 based on experience from China. Following the second update (May 2020) the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) adopted the list and Brighton commenced a systematic review process “to ensure an ongoing understanding of the full spectrum of COVID-19 disease and modification of the AESI list accordingly.” [7] This resulted in three additional AESIs being added to the list in December 2020. The subsequent (and most recent fourth) update did not result in any additional AESIs being added to the list. [1]. We matched SAEs recorded in the trial against an expanded list of AESIs created by combining Brighton’s SPEAC COVID-19 AESI list with a list of 29 clinical diagnoses Brighton identified as “known to have been reported but not in sufficient numbers to merit inclusion on the AESI list.” [7] Sensitivity analysis was used to determine whether use of the original versus expanded list altered our results.

So right away when I first read the preprint I wondered how these diagnoses were being combined mixed and matched. The new version of the paper doesn’t alleviate my questions. If you look at the Brighton Collaborative document you’ll see a lot of unremarkable standard AEs and SAEs but you’ll also find ones that require interpretation. Here is the table defining its AESIs in Brighton’s Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines (SPEAC):

The AESIs included because they have a theoretical or proven association with specific vaccine platforms are interesting mainly because none of them are associated with the mRNA platform but rather platforms that existed before the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were released. Also note how the AESIs are (mostly) listed as broad categories rather than specific diagnoses. Exceptions include of course myocarditis which is associated with COVID-19 and has been associated in safety data with COVID-19 vaccines but mapping the AEs in the clinical trials to these categories requires some subjectivity. There are more than just what’s listed above delineated in a number of charts under each organ system. For example colitis is listed in Annex 6 which encompasses the gastrointestinal system.

Indeed here’s a passage that suggested the subjectivity to me:

We matched SAEs recorded in the trial against an expanded list of AESIs created by combining Brighton’s SPEAC COVID-19 AESI list with a list of 29 clinical diagnoses Brighton identified as “known to have been reported but not in sufficient numbers to merit inclusion on the AESI list.” [7] Sensitivity analysis was used to determine whether use of the original versus expanded list altered our results.

I note that in the original preprint this passage read rather differently in that it used an example that really stood out as subjective:

We matched SAEs recorded in the trial against an expanded list of AESIs created by combining Brighton’s SPEAC COVID-19 AESI list with a list of 29 clinical diagnoses Brighton identified as “known to have been reported but not in sufficient numbers to merit inclusion on the AESI list.” Sensitivity analysis was used to determine whether the original versus expanded list had an effect on identifying a safety concern. For SAEs that described symptoms not diagnoses the clinician reviewers independently judged whether each SAE type was likely to have been caused by an AESI. For example the SAE “abdominal pain” is a symptom based diagnosis which was judged as fitting within the SPEAC clinical diagnosis of “colitis/enteritis.” Disagreements were resolved through consensus; in two cases consensus could not be reached and were resolved by the judgment of a third clinician reviewer (PW) to create a majority opinion. For each included SAE we recorded the corresponding Brighton Collaboration AESI category and organ.

Here’s a hint: Not all abdominal pain is due to colitis (inflammation of the colon) or enteritis (inflammation of the intestines). True these are common causes but there are so very many others. Similarly what mapped to myocarditis and pericarditis? There are lots of causes of chest pain other than myocarditis and pericarditis. Also in the supplemental data (which are in a Word document that can download and look at for yourself using a link at the end of the paper given that the lists are rather long to reproduce here) there are two lists a list of “Included SAE types (matching AESI list)” and a list of “Excluded SAE types (not matching AESI list).”

Admittedly many of the SAEs in the excluded list do make sense given that they include fractures gunshot wounds head injuries and the like but a number do not such as viral pharyngitis volvulus vomiting and others. When the preprint was published Dr. Susan Oliver has posted a video discussing the problems with it which I include here:

Dr. Oliver didn’t really discuss the meta problems with it and Doshi’s history but she did note many of the same things that I did in particular the odd choices of what was and wasn’t included as SAEs. For example Doshi included diarrhea but not vomiting (or as the surgeon in me can’t help but note intestinal perforation or volvulus the latter a known complication of a certain vaccine); hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) but not hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); gastrointestinal hemorrhage but not duodenal ulcer hemorrhage (which is a form of gastrointestinal hemorrhage); and coronary artery disease but not atherosclerosis (which causes coronary artery disease). It’s all very curious. Perhaps the most important issue is that “events related to COVID-19” were excluded which on the surface makes sense but given that COVID-19 cases were much more common in the placebo controlled group automatically biases the results for the remaining SAEs to the vaccine-group.

That’s not all though. Instead of comparing the number of people who had SAEs they did this:

In their review of SAEs supporting the authorization of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines the FDA concluded that SAEs were for Pfizer “balanced between treatment groups” [15] and for Moderna were “without meaningful imbalances between study arms.” [16] In contrast to the FDA analysis we found an excess risk of SAEs in the Pfizer trial. Our analysis of Moderna was compatible with FDA’s analysis finding no meaningful SAE imbalance between groups. The difference in findings for the Pfizer trial between our SAE analysis and the FDA’s may in part be explained by the fact that the FDA analyzed the total number of participants experiencing any SAE whereas our analysis was based on the total number of SAE events. Given that approximately twice as many individuals in the vaccine group than in the placebo group experienced multiple SAEs (there were 24 more events than participants in the vaccine group compared to 13 in the placebo group) FDA’s analysis of only the incidence of participants experiencing any SAE would not reflect the observed excess of multiple SAEs in the vaccine group.

To put it briefly they compared number of SAEs not the number of patients who suffered an SAE. This sort of analysis is guaranteed to double count SAES—at least!—because some of the SAEs or groups of SAES will be linked. For example as Dr. Oliver originally pointed out abdominal pain often goes along with diarrhea to which I would add that colitis or enterocolitis can lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Moreover formal reporting systems for clinical trial AEs require that all AEs be entered even when they are related which is why analyses are usually done at the patient-level as in “number of patients who suffered this AE” rather than in total AEs reported in each group independent of the number of patients. I’d be willing to bet that if the same statistical analysis were done using per-patient-level data rather than SAE-level data the statistical significance would likely disappear.

Let’s look at the new version of the “money table” which summarized the results and was being shared from the preprint on social media. I’ll cite David Grimes’ Tweet about it:

They *claimed* to find harms using a logistic regression on combined data but I've serious concerns about how they implemented that model and details aren't there. A simple 2×2 chi^2 test on their rate data yields this; aka nothing even after torture pic.twitter.com/knzTxN6RK9 — Dr David Robert Grimes (@drg1985) September 2 2022

At this point I can’t resist mentioning that defenders of the preprint claimed that this paper wasn’t “p-hacking” because no p-values were used. Personally I’ll give that one to them and call the paper an exercise in data-dredging instead. (Of course p-hacking is just a subset of the broader category of data dredging.) Or one can call it inflation bias if you like. It’s all the same thing in concept namely when researchers try out several statistical analyses and/or data eligibility specifications and then selectively report those that produce significant results—or in this case seemingly significant results. In any event whether you call it p-hacking data dredging or whatever else you might want to call it it has been a widespread problem even under normal circumstances in the scientific literature but a less known aspect of it is that it can be weaponized in the service of portraying vaccines in this case the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines as more dangerous than they are and the RCTs used to garner their EUAs in December 2020 as flawed and not showing the “true extent” of serious AEs attributable to them.

Fraiman et al. also included this doozy of a comparison in both the preprint and the final paper. Here’s the version from the final paper:

In the Moderna trial the excess risk of serious AESIs (15.1 per 10000 participants) was higher than the risk reduction for COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (6.4 per 10000 participants). [3] In the Pfizer trial the excess risk of serious AESIs (10.1 per 10000) was higher than the risk reduction for COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (2.3 per 10000 participants).

I notice that the wording was changed from “surpassed” to “was higher than” but it’s basically the same paragraph in the preprint and the final paper. So what’s the problem? Think of it this way. You can only hospitalize patients not SAEs (or AEs). An individual patient in the vaccine group could suffer more than one AE but a patient in the placebo control group could only be hospitalized once (in the context of the limited timeframe of the clinical trial) for COVID-19. Here Doshi is comparing apples and oranges in order to make it look as though the vaccines were more dangerous than actually getting COVID-19 which is a ridiculous contention given what we know. Moreover in clinical trials in general a lot of the “serious adverse events” are not serious enough to warrant hospitalization. In fact according to the standard terminology used to rate SAEs in clinical trials grade 3 events and above (on a five-point scale) are rated severe. If you look at the list of specific AEs you’ll see that some grade 3 AEs require hospitalization; some don’t. Grade 3 is defined as an AE that:

Is severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; OR

Requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; OR

Limits self care/activities of daily living (ADL)

For completeness I’ll mention that grade 4 AEs are by definition life-threatening events that require urgent intervention and that grade 5 events are by definition AEs that result in death. Any rigorous evaluation would compare hospitalizations due to AEs in control versus hospitalizations due to AEs in the vaccine group not AEs (regardless of whether they are AESIs or just AEs). Again the comparison was deeply intellectually dishonest then in the preprint and remains so now.

There’s another issue here as well. The rate of hospitalizations in the placebo control group would be expected to be highly dependent on the level of COVID-19 that was circulating in the populations tested during the time period in which the clinical trial was carried out as these trials were not challenge trials in which subjects are intentionally exposed to the virus. As a result most people in the placebo and vaccine groups were not exposed to COVID-19 because these trials were carried out in the summer and early fall of 2020 before the really big winter surge hit.

Here’s a graph of COVID-19 cases in the US in 2020-21:

Enrollment for the Moderna trial ended on October 23 2020; for the Pfizer trial November 14 2020. Note that this was before the winter surge took off. Had the trial started a few months later and ended in for example February 2021 or later you can bet that the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 would have been much higher in the placebo control group.

The bottom line is that this study is deeply misleading based on what sure looks like data dredging combined with misleading comparisons further combined with a low enough risk of COVID-19 in the two populations to allow for a low rate of hospitalization when normalized to the entire population in the control group.

This paper is nothing less than antivax misinformation disguised as a “reanalysis” of the original Pfizer and Moderna trials. Worse it doesn’t even show what it claims to have shown that the trials were somehow designed and written in such a way as to hide lots of adverse events. As such it’s no different at its core than Peter Doshi’s back-of-the-envelope “reanalysis” of the Pfizer trial in which he claimed that the vaccine was not more than 90% effective but rather only 19% effective. It just has fancier statistics and a much longer discussion of limitations including this section a beefed-up version of what is undoubtedly pure Peter Doshi given how it echoes what he’s been demanding since January 2021 when he falsely claimed that the vaccines were only 19% effective:

We emphasize that our investigation is preliminary to point to the need for more involved analysis. The risks of serious AESIs in the trials represent only group averages. SAEs are unlikely to be distributed equally across the demographic subgroups enrolled in the trial and the risks may be substantially less in some groups compared to others. Thus knowing the actual demographics of those who experienced an increase in serious AESI in the vaccine group is necessary for a proper harm-benefit analysis. In addition clinical studies are needed to see if particular SAEs can be linked to particular vaccine ingredients as opposed to unavoidable consequences of exposure to spike protein as future vaccines could then be modified accordingly or sensitivities can be tested for in advance. In parallel a systematic review and meta-analysis using individual participant data should be undertaken to address questions of harm-benefit in various demographic subgroups particularly in those at low risk of serious complications from COVID-19. Finally there is a pressing need for comparison of SAEs and harm-benefit for different vaccine types; some initial work has already begun in this direction. [47]. Full transparency of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial data is needed to properly evaluate these questions. Unfortunately as we approach 2 years after release of COVID-19 vaccines participant level data remain inaccessible. [45] [46].

Again given the billions of doses of these vaccines administered thus far the only reason to sift through subject-level data in nearly three year old clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each of which only included only tens of thousands of participants is if you’re looking for dirt and fraud not to do an objective evaluation of whether the vaccines are safe and effective. After all conditions have changed; the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the vaccines becoming significantly less effective against infection and transmission even as they remain potent at preventing hospitalization and death. If you really want to know how safe and effective the vaccines are now (and have been over time) the original clinical trials are far from the best dataset to use and this “reanalysis” failed to find even a signal that there might have been a severe design defect or fraud in the original clinical trials. I’m all for data transparency and have no objections to releasing patient level data but Doshi knows that this is not a trivial thing to do as all the data have to be carefully de-identified and curated.

The authors

Whenever reviewing a paper of this sort I always find it useful to look at the authors even at the risk of being accused of ad hominem. Of course it’s not an ad hominem if you discuss the persons making an argument briefly and then deconstruct the argument they make based on science data and reasoning. After all track record matters. Interestingly this group is to say the least a mixed bunch ranging from authors associated with antivaxxers to highly respected academics: Joseph Fraiman Juan Erviti Mark Jones Sander Greenland Patrick Whelan Robert M. Kaplan and Peter Doshi.

I’ll start with the corresponding author Peter Doshi because regular readers will know that we’ve written about his antivaccine messaging before. In brief Doshi is a senior editor at The BMJ  which inexplicably hired him several years ago despite his long history of playing footsie with the antivaccine movement since at least 2009 amplifying antivaccine conspiracy theories downplaying the severity of influenza and thus feeding antivaccine narratives using sleight-of-hand to downplay the effectiveness of flu vaccines and generally playing the role of a false skeptic with respect to vaccines as well as having signed a petition in 2006 “questioning” whether HIV causes AIDS. It continues to employ him even after he fell for a conspiracy theory that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) database was being made inaccessible to suppress reporting of serious adverse events. That’s not all though he’s also served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in antivaccine leader Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s lawsuit against the University of California’s influenza vaccine mandates.

Since the pandemic Doshi has only gotten worse. For example he has used his title as a BMJ editor when taking part in a “roundtable” organized by Sen. Ron Johnson to go dumpster diving in VAERS to find “vaccine injuries” due to COVID-19 vaccines whether the injuries were caused by them or not. In his testimony Doshi denied that COVID-19 at the time (November 2021) was a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”. He even cited cherry-picked tables to claim that the vaccine wasn’t saving lives in what was basically an updated rehash of the nonsense he had peddled a few months earlier in which he claimed that there was “no biodistribution data” for COVID-19 vaccines and made a number of other negative false claims about the vaccines (also deconstructed by Dr. Hilda Bastian). In a truly risible moment he even cited the Merriam-Webster definition of “antivaxxer” as opposed to those supposedly opposed to vaccine mandates to argue that he and his fellow COVID-19 contrarians were “not antivaccine” and that large numbers of people would qualify as “antivaccine”. He even parroted the antivaccine talking point that mRNA vaccines are not really vaccines and therefore shouldn’t be mandated like vaccines.

But what about the rest? Two other names that immediately leapt out at me are Joseph Fraiman and Patrick Whelan. Dr. Fraiman is an emergency medicine doctor in New Orleans who has appeared at the Urgency of Normal summit held by Gov. DeSantis and Dr. Ladapo and been associated with COVID-19 minimization since the beginning of the pandemic. In particular recently he has been arguing that children should not be vaccinated against COVID-19 using arguments identical to those used by antivaxxers to argue against childhood vaccines since…time immemorial: “The question is if you have a child who is at risk or has co-risk factors for COVID-19 that’s a discussion with your pediatrician but if you have a healthy child the chances of that child dying are incredibly low essentially close to zero if not actually zero”. He’s also made statements claiming that “unvaccinated are more educated on the vaccine than most people who have gotten it” and that experts cannot disprove concerns made by anti-vaccine advocates. (He’s also recently embraced the Great Barrington Declaration despite its increasing irrelevance.) You get the idea.

As for Patrick Whelan he’s a pediatric rheumatologist at UCLA who made a splash in December 2020 by testifying to the FDA about his fears that the Pfizer mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine could cause microvascular injury to the brain heart liver and kidneys in ways not assessed in safety trials and has been featured on antivaccine websites. He’s also warned against vaccinating those who have had COVID-19 because “sky high” antibodies after vaccination in people who were previously infected may contribute to adverse events. He too appeared at Sen. Ron Johnson’s antivaccine panel to fearmonger about spike protein from COVID-19 vaccines. Of late Dr. Whelan appears to have been more quiet with more recent searches turning up his name mainly in association with his December 2020 testimony and things he said in 2021. This paper apparently represents a return to vaccine “skepticism”.

I’ll be honest I wasn’t able to find much about Mark Jones and Juan Erviti. Jones is an associate professor of health sciences and medicine at the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare as well as a biostatistician at Bond University in Australia. Searches for his name related to COVID-19 turned up little except references to the preprint and Vaccine study an article on cancer overdiagnosis with little on COVID-19 other than articles studying healthcare workers’ responses to the pandemic and a letter asking why more studies of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy haven’t been carried out in Australia. As for Erviti he’s published with Doshi before in The BMJ expressing skepticism over monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy as well as a BMJ Rapid Response to an article demanding patient-level data from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials.

Then there are Sander Greenland and Robert M. Kaplan who will feature in the next section.

The real reason why Vaccine published this paper?

The two authors of this paper who seem beyond reproach are Sander Greenland and Robert M. Kaplan. Greenland as I mentioned above is a retired emeritus professor and a veritable god of statistics someone whom I have regularly cited before. Kaplan is a Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Health Services and Medicine at UCLA where he led the UCLA/RAND US Agency for Health Care Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) health services training program and the UCLA/RAND CDC Prevention Research Center. Currently he is an adjunct professor of medicine and primary care and population health at Stanford University. He’s had a long and storied career having published over 560 articles and chapters and served as Chief Science Officer at the AHRQ and Associate Director of the National Institutes of Health where he led the behavioral and social sciences programs. He was also Professor and Chair of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California San Diego and is past president of several professional societies including the American Psychological Association Division of Health Psychology Section J of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Pacific) the International Society for Quality of Life Research the Society for Behavioral Medicine and the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research. He was also elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2005.

Seeing these two makes me wonder: Why on earth did they sign on to this awfulness? For Sander Greenland there could well be an answer. I can’t believe I either didn’t know or remember this but this isn’t Greenland’s first antivax rodeo. Does anyone remember the Autism Omnibus hearings? Back in the mid-2000s the Vaccine Court decided to take an approach to the flood of claims attributing autism to “vaccine injury” in which complainants would choose a few cases that they considered to be the very best the most convincing as evidence of a link between vaccines and autism dividing them into two groups: causation due to mercury in the thimerosal preservative that had been used in many childhood vaccines before 2002 and other causation (e.g. MMR as a cause of autism). These cases then served as “test cases” to determine whether the ~5000 other cases could go forward. Let’s just say that the complainants’ cases were all based on bad science and featured many of the usual suspects as expert witnesses arguing for vaccine causation. However it turns out that one of those expert witnesses was not one of the usual suspects. As Steve Salzberg described at the time of a ruling on the test cases for a thimerosal-autism link it was Sander Greenland:

It’s interesting that Vowell found that even if the “exquisitely small” amounts of mercury in vaccines had an effect they wouldn’t cause autism. It was also somewhat sad to see how a well-known statistician UCLA professor Sander Greenland appearing in support of the thimerosal-autism link embarrassed himself by presenting testimony that “largely represented an opinion based on a set of assumptions” according to the ruling. Greenland’s arguments relied entirely on the existence of “clearly regressive autism” but the Special Master pointed out that Greenland “was not qualified to opine on its existence.” Ouch.

Apparently if the comments after Salzberg’s post are to be believed Greenland later tried to claim that he had not testified in favor of a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism but he most definitely did. I have the receipts in terms of the transcript of his testimony.

As for Kaplan I still remain puzzled why he put his name on this paper. It’s a blot on his reputation. On the other hand in July 2021 Kaplan was arguing that vaccines were getting more credit than they deserved for the decline of COVID-19 cases being observed at the time touting—you guessed it!—”natural immunity”:

As coronavirus infections decline in the U.S. it seems appropriate to celebrate the triumph of vaccines over viruses. But how much of the credit do vaccines deserve? Less than you might expect.

And later:

But one trend appears to be clear. As in previous pandemics the rapid fall in new cases preceded the widespread distribution of vaccines. Although vaccines deserve much credit for declining rates of Covid-19 the protection provided by natural infection has been underappreciated. Emerging evidence shows that previously infected people have effective and durable immunity that rivals or exceeds the benefits of vaccines.

Sound familiar? I also note that this was before the rise of the Omicron variants which have shown that “natural immunity” after infection is anything but “durable”. Still you get the idea. Kaplan also wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal  a hotbed of COVID-19 minimization in which he stated that the “idea that recent deliberate misinformation campaigns created hesitancy to the Covid-19 vaccine appears itself to be misinformation”. So apparently Kaplan was predisposed to Doshi’s narrative about the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials because he thinks that “natural immunity” to COVID=19 is being ignored by public health officials. I could be wrong but at least that’s the way it appears to me.

Defenders of Fraiman et al. will of course vigorously deny that they are antivaccine (as do all the authors themselves) and frequently issue a rejoinder along the lines of accusing anyone who questions anything about the safety and efficacy of any vaccine “antivaccine”. My rejoinder to such a rejoinder would be to suggest that maybe—just maybe—when you coauthor a study that leads to headlines on antivax sites like “Landmark first peer-reviewed study on Pfizer and Moderna covid vaccines confirms ‘excess risk’ of adverse side effects“ “New Study of Pfizer and Moderna Data Suggests Vaccine Harm Outweighs Benefit” (on The Epoch Times  yet!) or “Vaccinated at Higher Risk of Serious Adverse Events: Reanalysis of Original Trial Data” (also The Epoch Times ) it should give you serious pause about what has been published. Again maybe—just maybe—when your study inspires a hard core antivaxxer like Dr. Paul Alexander to publicize on his Substack with a rabid-sounding title like “BOOM! Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joe Ladapo SCHLONGING big pharma Pfizer & Moderna all of them; new Doshi study in VACCINE journal shows catastrophic adverse events after mRNA injections” (and using the study as the basis for a whole lot of other invective against vaccines) you should reconsider where your career has brought you. (As an aside I must admit that I’ve never seen “schlong” used as a verb much less in all caps in this manner. Clearly I am more sheltered than I had thought.) Maybe—just maybe—when your study has inspired over 16000 Twitter interactions across over 2400 Tweets and 14000 re-Tweets in just five days the vast majority of which are using your study to amplify antivaccine conspiracy theories you might ask yourself if your study is actually antivax propaganda more than a study.

A few more examples because I can’t resist:

It’s not antibodies that are the issue. Its what else the vaccines do. Eg see: https://t.co/mdCqqwFx6l

As I perused mentions of this study on Twitter I also noted that quite a few of the Tweets were just links to the study Tweeted in response to pro-vaccine Tweets.

Don’t get me wrong though. Contrary to how antivaxxers will characterize what I just wrote I’m not saying that vaccines are sacrosanct in any way. It is certainly true that if a scientist participates in a scientifically sound study that comes to a conclusion that antivaxxers happen like because it calls the safety or efficacy of a vaccine into question absolutely the scientist should stand by the results. Unfortunately that is not what we have here—far from it! In fact what we appear to have here is not a group of scientists innocently wondering if there were more adverse events (of special interest!) in the vaccinated group in the Pfizer and Moderna studies but rather a group of scientists that included several who almost certainly started with the conclusion that the vaccines must be more harmful than the disease and looked for a manner to “reanalyze” the clinical trial data to come to that conclusion even if they had to compare apples and oranges (AEs and hospitalizations) and redefine AES as AESIs in order to achieve the desired result. Even then they failed as David Grimes points out.

I’ll conclude this post with a little speculation—and I openly admit that it is speculation as I have no “inside knowledge”—about why this paper as horrible as it is as heavily (and correctly) criticized as the preprint was in June ended up in Vaccine with only relatively minor changes in the context of its findings. I strongly suspect that it’s the same reason that John Ioannidis was able to get a much worse paper published rather easily in which he used a satirical index of scientific influence in order to portray critics of the Great Barrington Declaration as far more influential on social media than they are for actual science. It’s the name. When someone like Ioannidis submits a manuscript as the most published living scientist at the moment someone whose reputation is downright intimidating rare is the peer reviewer or editor who will just say: Reject! Although Sander Greenland and Robert Kaplan are not quite at the level of John Ioannidis they are very eminent in their fields with Greenland being a legend. Again I cannot demonstrate it but it’s not unreasonable to suspect that those names dazzled the reviewers and editors who changed what should have been a rejection to a conditional acceptance in which the authors had to change a few things and add a lot more caveats but left their basic analysis more or less intact. Thus was born antivax propaganda disguised as a “reanalysis” of clinical trial data.

I end with a plea to the most eminent physicians and scientists among us: Learn to understand how exercises like this one are weaponized as disinformation and refuse to lend your eminent names to them. When you sign on to a manuscript like this you become part of the problem and provide antivaxxers with the powerful ammunition of your reputation no matter how much you might try to tell yourself that you’re just doing a scientific study and are not antivaccine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcGxlcmlkZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hcGxlLXJpZGdlLXdvbWFuLWNvbXBlbnNhdGVkLWZvci1tb3RoZXJzLWRlYXRoLWZyb20tY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS0yNjcyMDUx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maple Ridge woman compensated for mother's death from COVID-19 vaccine,"Frustrated by Canada’s Vaccine Injury Support Program

Franci DuPerron of Maple Ridge lost her mother to a COVID-19 vaccination.

She is one of the first people in Canada to be compensated for a family member’s death under Canada’s Vaccine Injury Support Program. The program’s payments are not yet made public.

DuPerron has lived in B.C. since the 1980s. She got a call from a retirement home in Windsor Ontario in January of 2021 informing her that her 79-year-old mother had died.

Her mother had received a Moderna vaccine. Ten minutes later she was having a hard time breathing. Soon she was unconscious. A nurse administered two EpiPens – one in a leg and one in an arm but they couldn’t save her.

“She was gone in 15 minutes.”

It had been a severe anaphylactic shock despite the fact that she had never had an allergic reaction in the past.

“I was stunned” said DuPerron. “I couldn’t wrap my head around it.”

DuPerron said she is not an anti-vaxxer but she would like to see more transparency around the vaccines and their effects. Very little has been reported about her mother’s death she said.

Her mom had pre-existing conditions – she had suffered with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysema and diabetes. So she was nervous about getting the jab. They talked the day before and DuPerron said with her health issues her mom could be at high risk if she contacted COVID-19.

After her mother’s death from the vaccine DuPerrron spoke to a lawyer. She and learned that the vaccine companies could not be held liable because the vaccines were developed under emergency use conditions.

But the lawyer did tell her about the Vaccine Injury Support Program and DuPerron wants other people to be aware that it is out there.

The program started in June of 2021. So far it has 774 claims and most are still being processed. Just eight claims are reported to have been approved by the program’s medical review board.

More statistics area available online.

DuPerron believes her case went through the process comparatively quickly – she was compensated in February of this year – because it was such a clear-cut case. Her mother stopped breathing and died within minutes of being injected with the vaccine. The coroner’s report and autopsy confirmed she had died from an allergic reaction to the vaccine.

“There was no doubt in anyone’s mind it was the vaccine that killed her” she said.

Still it was a long and frustrating process. For example she was asked by officials to present her mother’s vaccine passport even though she had died months before that program even started. DuPerron is dubious about someone suffering from symptoms after getting a vaccine being able to get compensation.

DuPerron said nobody in Canada will get rich from the Vaccine Injury Support Program. She had been hoping to get just $8000 to cover funeral expenses. The amount was significantly more than that although she cannot say how much. She said it’s irrelevant.

“The amount of money I got from my mom… what dollar amount can you put on a life? There is no price.”

She gave most of the payment to family.

What happened to her mother has been reported as being rare. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control out of the first 4 million doses of Moderna vaccine in that country there were 1266 adverse events reported and 108 were identified for severe allergic reactions.

DuPerron is an unflappable person. She was a career cop – just the second woman to serve as an RCMP officer at a busy Williams Lake detachment in the 1980s. But she wasn’t about to take the Moderna vaccine.

She has gotten the first two Pfizer vaccines and a booster. It wasn’t without incident. She was diabetic and each time she received the vaccine her blood sugar spiked. She went to hospital thinking she was having a heart attack. The first time it took months for her health to return to normal. With the second jab it was a matter of weeks.

Still DuPerron plans to get another booster if it is offered this fall provided there is an alternative to Moderna."

Molina Healthcare based in Long Beach California plans to acquire My Choice Wisconsin of Wauwatosa which has a sizable presence in Dane County. Humana based in Louisville Kentucky plans to purchase Inclusa of Stevens Point.

My Choice and Inclusa are the largest of four managed care organizations or MCOs that run Family Care a state program that provides home care transportation job support and other services to keep people out of nursing homes. Started in 2000 as an alternative to county-run services Family Care has helped Wisconsin retain a good reputation for long-term care with the state ranking third nationally in a 2020 scorecard.

But the number of MCOs participating in Family Care has declined in recent years with some of those that remain making what advocates say are questionably large surpluses over the past two years from state and federal tax dollars. Molina and Humana could be preparing to also buy the other remaining MCOs which would give the state little leverage to rein in profits and protect patients advocates say.

“These big insurance companies can hold the state hostage if they want to” said Mitch Hagopian managing attorney for Disability Rights Wisconsin. The state “needs to make sure (the companies) are not squeezing all of the profits they possibly can at the expense of restricting services to Family Care members.”

With a caregiver workforce shortage already making it difficult for some people on Family Care to obtain services “it seems like a really bad time to be pulling money out of the system and not ... making provider rates higher” said Janet Zander with the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources.

Uncertain outlook

Nancy Alar’s son Matt Ward 44 who has autism lives in his own Downtown Madison apartment works at the Downtown library and sells art he makes at Artworking a nonprofit for disabled artists on Madison’s Far East Side.

Alar worried Ward would lose his independence when Dane County became the last county in the state to join Family Care in 2018 as required under a 2015 state law. But Ward’s services continued without a snag through a Family Care alternative called IRIS which stands for Include Respect I Self Direct.

“His life did not change” Alar said. “I like to describe him as ‘gloriously autistic.’”

But she is concerned the new acquisitions could change the nature of Family Care and IRIS which allows clients to choose their own caregivers. Molina already owns The Management Group or TMG the largest IRIS consulting agency. Critics fear Molina will try to transfer clients between Family Care and IRIS to its financial advantage.

“The future is a little bit iffy” Alar said.

‘Clear conflict’

Disability Rights Wisconsin the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources and other groups wrote to state Insurance Commissioner Nathan Houdek saying Molina’s ownership of TMG and proposed purchase of My Choice present a “clear conflict.” The groups also said the merger would “substantially reduce competition in insurance in the state.”

The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance has not yet received filings to review Molina’s acquisition of My Choice announced in July or Humana’s purchase of Inclusa announced in August OCI spokesperson Sara Smith said.

The state Department of Health Services which oversees Family Care and IRIS “will continue to ensure members receive appropriate care and have access to services as we work with the entities involved to understand the specifics of their plans” spokesperson Jennifer Miller said in an email.

DHS “engages in many oversight activities to ensure managed care organizations are of a high quality and meet contract and performance expectations” Miller said.

“Molina’s mission is to improve the health and lives of our members by delivering high-quality health care” spokesperson Caroline Zubieta said in a statement. “The Family Care and IRIS programs are distinct Medicaid waiver programs that have rules and regulations preventing any agency from exerting influence on an individual’s enrollment choices.”

Humana spokesperson Mark Taylor said in a statement: “Inclusa will continue to offer all current services in accordance with its state contract and Humana has no plans to reduce the level of services provided to Inclusa members.”

An evolution

Before Family Care started some counties offered few services and others provided many with some having long wait lists said Lynn Breedlove the retired former executive director of Disability Rights Wisconsin.

Family Care made services more equal among counties and reduced wait lists Breedlove said. Today 56000 people are in Family Care or related programs and 24000 are in IRIS.

In 2015 under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker DHS said it would revamp the system replacing MCOs with integrated health agencies — some likely from out of state — that would provide medical care along with supportive services. The move would slow the growing cost of a $3.4 billion program that made up 20% of Medicaid enrollment and 40% of the Medicaid budget DHS said at the time.

After complaints from advocates and clients DHS dropped the plan in 2016. Now with Molina and Humana poised to enter the market similar concerns are emerging about companies outside of Wisconsin deciding how to allocate the services.

“It makes people nervous” Breedlove said. “If there’s a chance to make profit by cutting down on people’s individual service plans that’s what the shareholders and top managers will want these companies to do.”

Larger gains

Tim Hood former board chairman at St. Coletta of Wisconsin in Jefferson whose developmentally disabled daughter lives at St. Coletta said he’s already concerned about the surpluses MCOs make. He said the low rates the MCOs pay service providers make it difficult for St. Coletta to stay open and contributed to the closure of Watertown-based Bethesda Lutheran Communities.

“Something is wrong here” Hood said referring to the gains in 2020-21. “That’s not what Family Care is supposed to be about.”

DHS limits MCO profits on the service portion of their payments to 4% with MCOs keeping all gains or losses up to 2% half of gains or losses between 2% and 6% and all gains or losses over 6% Miller said. DHS shares in the gains or losses MCOs can’t keep.

The program “incentivizes MCOs to reinvest funding into the provider community to meet member needs while also providing financial stability for MCOs and the members they serve” Miller said.

DHS plans to set minimum rates MCOs have to pay service providers by 2024 she said.

‘Disappointing’ service

Sue Werner guardian of a 62-year-old Madison woman with cerebral palsy in Family Care said dealing with My Choice has been “disappointing” and the shift to for-profit companies is “disconcerting.”

The woman she helps has had six care managers since March 2020 which is disruptive and has to pay for an outside nursing service that should be provided through Family Care said Werner who before retiring oversaw related services for the Dane County Department of Human Services.

Rise Up a Madison agency that supports the woman Werner helps in the woman’s apartment became so frustrated with My Choice’s contractual details that it is leaving Family Care said Amy Melton-White executive director of Rise Up. The agency is staying only with IRIS to which Werner is switching the woman.

From cereal to cookies to bars a combination of pumpkin and pumpkin spice flavoring — which generally is accepted as a blend of pumpkin and pumpkin pie flavors — is finding its way into every snacking occasion.

General Mills Inc. has introduced pumpkin spice Cheerios to its cereal portfolio made using a blend of pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spices. The company also has expanded the portfolio of its Pillsbury brand launching Pillsbury Pumpkin Grands! and Pillsbury pumpkin cookie dough with cream cheese flavored chunks. The Pillsbury Pumpkin Grands! resemble the original Pillsbury Grands! with the addition of pumpkin spice icing to accompany five ready-to-bake cinnamon rolls.

RXBAR a subsidiary of the Kellogg Co. is debuting a seasonal pumpkin spice flavored bar that contains 12 grams of protein per serving. Also in the bar category Nature’s Bakery a brand of Kind Snacks — which is a subsidiary of Mars Inc. — is debuting pumpkin spice fig bars.

Tate’s Bake Shop has introduced pumpkin spice cookies featuring creamy white chocolate chips and Voortman Cookies is releasing two fall-inspired wafers: pumpkin spice and s’mores. Entenmann’s is expanding its Little Bites portfolio with the addition of Little Bites pumpkin muffins.

“The entire Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. organization is profoundly saddened by this shocking loss” the company said in a statement on Sunday before the death of its CFO Gustavo Arnal was ruled a suicide.

The company credited Arnal as being “instrumental” in leading the organization during the pandemic after joining the company in May 2020 remembering him as an “esteemed colleague in the financial community.”

The company’s statement gave no details regarding his death.

“I wish to extend our sincerest condolences to Gustavo’s family” Harriet Edelman independent chair of Bed Bath & Beyond’s board said in the statement. “Gustavo will be remembered by all he worked with for his leadership talent and stewardship of our Company.”

Eleven days before his death Arnal was accused in a lawsuit of participating in a “pump and dump” scheme to artificially inflate the retailer’s value. “Pump and dump” refers to spreading false or misleading information to trigger a buying frenzy that leads to an inflated stock price before the instigators sell their personal shares at that inflated price.

Bed Bath & Beyond told Reuters it was “in the early stages of evaluating the complaint but based on current knowledge the company believes the claims are without merit.”

Recently the retailer announced a business update “intended to meet the demand of its customers drive growth and profitability and improve its balance sheet and cash flows.” To save $250 million in spending the company said it would close 150 stores and lay off 20% of its workforce.

Since Arnal’s death the company has promoted its chief accounting officer Laura Crossen to fill in as the chief financial officer. The company’s shares dropped nearly 18% to $7.09 in midday trading on Tuesday on the news of the former CFO’s death.

Bed Bath & Beyond did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The inaugural EMEA Multicultural Innovation Lab expands on the US programme whose 59 portfolio companies have raised more than $150M in funding since their participation in the five-month programme

London -

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today announced that five start-ups led by women and ethnic minority founders whose businesses range from collecting energy and carbon data to education technology have been selected to participate in the inaugural Multicultural Innovation Lab (MCIL) cohort in Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Running from September 2022 to February 2023 the EMEA programme will see the five women CEOs – the majority of whom are ethnically diverse – and their C-suite colleagues take their companies through a customised five-month experience designed to accelerate their growth and development. Chosen from over 1200 applications these leaders will benefit from the close support of Morgan Stanley’s global ecosystem of internal and external partners which will provide a variety of mentorship opportunities and business-growth resources.

Through the Lab Morgan Stanley is also making an aggregate £1 million investment in these high-growth firms all of which are in the pre-Series A stage.

Clare Woodman Head of EMEA at Morgan Stanley commented: “We are delighted to introduce our first cohort comprised of five highly innovative women and ethnically diverse-led start-ups. Each through the Multicultural Innovation Lab will gain access to capital content and connections enabling them to accelerate the growth of their businesses.”

MCIL was first launched in the US in 2017 to help close a persistent funding gap faced by women and ethnic minority entrepreneurs. The Lab’s mission is to create a more inclusive investment landscape by not only providing capital but by also leveraging Morgan Stanley’s expertise and networks to support women and diverse founders on their growth journeys.

“I’m particularly pleased that the CEOs in our first cohort are all women the majority of whom are ethnically diverse” said Sanghamitra Karra Managing Director and EMEA Head of the Multicultural Client Strategy Group. “The five were selected on the merits of their innovative offerings and significant investment potential. Their intersectional diversity across race and gender was seen as a key factor driving greater innovation and resilience potential.”

The five companies that have been selected for the inaugural EMEA MCIL cohort include the following:

Heaton will report to Rockefeller Chief Executive Greg Fleming marking yet another reunion for the pair of executives who have worked together for a quarter century. The two previously worked together at Merrill Lynch for 15 years until its 2009 sale to Bank of America and Heaton in 2012 was lured to Morgan Stanley by Fleming then president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management according to a Reuters report at the time.

“He brings tremendous experience energy and intensity thought leadership integrity a tireless focus on excellence and a collaborative approach to clients colleagues and everyone he encounters” Fleming who left Morgan Stanley in 2016 and has helmed Rockefeller since its 2018 recapitalization said in a statement.

In his new role Heaton is advising Fleming on growth plans and will focus initially on expanding Rockefeller’s Global Family Office product offerings across credit banking insurance annuities and retirement streams according to the announcement. He will also serve on Rockefeller’s management committee.

Heaton could not immediately be reached for comment. A Rockefeller spokeswoman confirmed Heaton joined Rockefeller in a newly created position and that he started on Tuesday.

In an internal memo in August Morgan Stanley treasurer John Ryan was named as Heaton’s replacement as president of Morgan Stanley’s U.S. bank operating subsidiaries according to a Bloomberg report.

A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed Heaton’s departure but declined to comment further.

In his previous role at Morgan Stanley Heaton led banking and lending products for both the wealth management and institutional securities divisions overseeing two bank entities with about $400 billion in assets altogether according to Rockefeller’s announcement.

He began his career in 1989 at Merrill where over two decades he held a series of senior leadership roles including as global treasurer head of global strategy and business development. Prior to Morgan Stanley he worked as an investment banker leading Deutsche Bank’s North American financial institutions group.

Heaton’s twin David is a managing director and investment banker focused on asset management deals and has been with Morgan Stanley since 2010 according to LinkedIn and BrokerCheck. Another brother Seth Heaton is head of North American Banks at Citi’s Financial Institutions Group.

Two years ago a writer in Foreign Policy lamented that the U.S. has tried and failed to “get Israel to break up with China.” A year later it was the editor of the Jerusalem Post who argued that Israel “has to choose” between Washington and Beijing while the Washington Post noted that Israel’s failure to do so was “testing its relationship with the U.S.” Mosaic has been raising this question from the beginning: a 2015 headline asked “Is China a Friend of Israel?” but by 2018 the definitive answer was that “Israel’s embrace of China is sorely misguided” and by 2020 this embrace was an “impasse obstructing U.S.-Israel relations.” The concerns expressed in these and scores of other articles are all too real: the People’s Republic of China is a serious challenge the U.S.-China rivalry is becoming more intense and Washington is troubled by its allies’ entanglements with Beijing. But the issues are not quite so stark as we are often told.

This might seem an odd thing to say in 2022 when what were once the worries of a few foreign-policy wonks and former diplomats have become a major part of the public discourse. In the 30-odd months since I last wrote about this subject in Mosaic the world has been transformed. American economic and diplomatic competition with China has become more overt and more intense in almost every sphere. At home the Chinese government has grown more assertive tightening its grip on Hong Kong and subjecting the Uyghurs of Xinjiang to myriad ordeals and cruelties. Abroad its representatives practice “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy bluntly condemning the policies of its perceived rivals and responding aggressively to any criticism. Then there are Beijing’s severe economic and diplomatic measures against Australia—for voicing support for an international inquiry into the sources of COVID-19—and Lithuania—for allowing a Taiwanese embassy to open in Vilnius. China’s implicit backing for the Russian war on Ukraine has brought the polarization of the international system into sharper relief while its continued threatening of Taiwan raises worries of a showdown that could have far-reaching effects on the entire world order. Add to this the coronavirus pandemic and the attendant economic and social disruption and the result is a worldwide shift in China’s perceived power and reputation.

America for its part has changed in response. Despite the major tonal differences between the Biden administration and its predecessor there has been a great deal of continuity between the two in dealing with China and the Indo-Pacific. While there remains much uncertainty and debate about how to confront China there is now unlike before little question that its ambitions must be countered. Overall the U.S. sees its task as defending the global order of free trade and respect for national sovereignty. Beijing by contrast views American polices as an effort to contain and weaken its influence.

In this atmosphere of heightened tensions it’s easy to understand some of the panic about Israel “falling into China’s orbit” or ending up “on the wrong side” of a new cold war. Yet such panic is both unmerited and unhelpful. To see why it’s necessary to follow some basic guidelines: mind the facts details and timelines; beware assumptions of linear continuity; doubt broad sweeping statements; be sure to look at numbers in their proper scale and context; compare and contrast Israel with other players facing similar choices; test authors’ claims against official statements; and accept evidence even when it contradicts prior assumptions. Applying some of those practices may provide a more credible readout of Israel-China relations than the headlines’ cannonade.

I. Roads Chips and Alliances

Before digging into the current details some background is in order. The natural place to begin is in 2012 when Xi Jinping became the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and president of China. The following year China announced what came to be known as the Belt and Road Initiative—a vision of a global network of transportation industry and telecommunication infrastructure that would advance Beijing’s economic and strategic agendas. In concrete terms this meant investing in the building of ports railways power plants cellular networks and so forth across Asia and into not only Europe and Africa but also Latin America and the Arctic with the goal of creating an integrated “new silk road.” In the past year Beijing also announced the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative—as yet vaguely defined mutually reinforcing efforts to promote sustainable development and security based on “respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity” in accordance with China’s worldview and interests.

Against these Washington has worked with its allies to advance several counter-efforts: the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to provide an alternative to the Belt and Road that helps low- and middle-income countries develop their infrastructure in environmentally sound ways; the Quad a security forum for strategic dialogue among the U.S. Australia India and Japan revitalized to manage maritime security economic and humanitarian issues; the 2021 pact among the U.S. UK and Australia to cooperate on security issues in the Indo-Pacific known as AUKUS; and the Partners in the Blue Pacific an alliance of the AUKUS countries plus Japan and New Zealand that seeks to offset China’s influence in the Pacific. NATO has also been awakened by Russia’s war in Ukraine and is starting to see its role expanding beyond Europe towards the Indo-Pacific.

Beyond the questions of infrastructure trade military buildups and diplomatic and economic alliances that are familiar arenas of Great Power competition emerging technologies—especially semiconductors—have become vital issues. Just last month President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science act providing $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research development and manufacturing in order to address the growing risks posed by Asian domination of this industry and America’s increasing dependence on foreign supply chains. The administration also banned the export of top-level artificial intelligence-enabling computer chips to China seeking to slow the latter’s advances in this field. One might be tempted to imagine a “Silicon Curtain” descending upon a decoupled globe where neither side buys chips from the other—except that our world is much more intertwined and interdependent than it was during the 20th century’s cold war and it will remain so for many years even if a new cold war between the U.S. and China intensifies. This evolving situation replete with internal tensions opposing goals and policy contradictions demands complexity and nuance which are abundant in America’s policies as in those of its allies.

Following several years of rapidly growing relations with China since early last decade this past year continued to provide much evidence of strengthening ties. But that isn’t the whole story.

Where does this leave Israel? Following several years of rapidly growing relations with China since early last decade championed by then-Prime Minister Netanyahu this past year continued to provide much evidence of strengthening ties. In September 2021 the Shanghai International Port Group began operating the Haifa Bayport while the University of International Business and Economics (UIBE) in Beijing opened a campus in Petach Tikvah near Tel Aviv. On November 17 2021 Presidents Xi Jinping and Isaac Herzog spoke by phone about the upcoming 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between their two countries and about how to develop those relations further. Vice-President Wang Qishan and Foreign Minister and then-Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid headed the fifth meeting of the Sino-Israeli Joint Innovation Committee which was held virtually on January 24 the day of the anniversary itself. Currently the two governments are negotiating a free-trade agreement while the overall volume of trade between them continues to grow. But this isn’t the whole story.

II. The Numbers

It’s easy to be floored by the big numbers and much commentary on the subject of Israel-China relations has relied heavily on a few figures. Those who see reason for panic point out that bilateral trade has grown from $50 million in 1992 to the $15 billion in 2021 (according to Israel’s Bureau of Statistics) or even $22.8 billion (according to China’s). Then there is the Chinese investment in the Israeli high-tech sector which has also grown over the years. But these figures can be misleading and when they are presented—as they often are—without the proper context they obscure more than they reveal.

It’s easy to be floored by the big numbers but a closer look at the data shows that in 2018 both Israeli exports to China and Chinese investment in Israel peaked.

A closer look at the data shows that in 2018 both Israeli exports to China and Chinese investment in Israel peaked. The former thereafter declined and then plateaued: chips produced in Israel by the mulinational corporation Intel account for about half of all these exports; minerals and chemicals account for another quarter. Meanwhile investments decreased dramatically and the number of deals in 2021 stands at 44 percent of what it was in 2018. If the second half of 2022 follows the pattern of the first this year’s deals will near a third of the 2018 peak. Some sources describe a decline in Chinese investment in Israel from around 10 percent of the foreign investment in Israeli high tech a few years ago to the low single digits at present. That being said precise and comprehensive data are not publicly available.

To put these figures in proportion Israel’s whole yearly trade volume with China throughout 2021 was roughly equal to America’s exports to China in November 2021 alone. While the pandemic’s repercussions on Israel’s place in the international economy remain to be seen research by Doron Ella shows that in 2020 China’s share (not counting Hong Kong) in Israel’s foreign trade in goods $11.8 billion was still behind Israeli trade with either the EU ($40.1 billion) or with America ($18.1 billion). Recent data that include Hong Kong put China’s trade with Israel in 2021 at $18.16 billion compared to the EU’s $43.23 billion and the US’s $21.31 billion.

Comparing the relative size of Israel’s export of services to these three partners provides an even sharper picture. In 2020 Israel exported $170 million worth of services to China compared to nearly $17 billion to the U.S. and more than $7 billion to the EU. Develop as it may Israel’s comparative trade with these three major partners depends more on their economic performance than on any decision taken in Jerusalem.

On the monetary side of the equation news broke in April that the Bank of Israel added the yuan to its reserve currencies for the first time. Reporting on this fact in isolation makes it seem as if China is expanding its hold on the Israeli economy at America’s expense. But the fine print explained that Israel diversified its currency mix from dollars euros and British pounds to include Canadian and Australian dollars (3.5 percent each) as well as the yen (5 percent) and yuan (2 percent). While the changes will indeed include a decrease in the share in dollars from 66.5 percent to the still-dominant 61 percent it is the euro’s share that dropped most—from 30 percent to 20 percent. In other words this wasn’t a move away from American to Chinese currency but a general diversification that still mostly favored the currencies of U.S. allies.

In short the frequently quoted numbers regarding the volume of Israel-China trade are a poor indicator of economic realities and a closer look reflects a flat export curve against increasing imports from China to Israel as experienced by most other nations. While a simplified depiction of economic relations between the two countries from 1999—or 2001 or even 2010—would show a trend of linear growth a more subtle examination shows many areas where commerce has stalled or declined. Focus on trade in goods also misses the negligible trade in services. And just as importantly Israel-China numbers and trends presented alone naturally lack the context and scale added by comparing them to other countries relations with China first and foremost the United States whose economic relations with China despite the growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing dwarfs Israel’s on each and every count.

III. Infrastructure

Chinese involvement in Israeli infrastructure has received much attention from the would-be Cassandras warning of the unstoppable takeover of the Jewish state by Beijing. The warnings usually note several significant Chinese projects on Israeli soil: the 2007 Mount Carmel tunnels the Ashdod Southern Port the Haifa Bayport the Sorek 1 desalination plant south of Tel Aviv and the red-line light rail which when completed will connect Tel Aviv to several cities in its vicinity. About the last we are usually reminded that it runs “within a mere 150 meters” of the IDF’s headquarters the Kiryah insinuating potential security hazards as a result of proximity and disregarding both Israel’s probable security measures around the highly sensitive site and the comparative espionage potential of other nearby buildings above ground. In the previous decade especially partnerships involving Chinese companies successfully bid and won several infrastructure projects with strong support from then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Transportation Minister Israel Katz.

But here too there is more to the story. Take the best-known of these infrastructure-related security concerns regarding the Chinese firm SIPG’s operation of the Haifa Bayport. Not only is the Bayport near the Israeli navy’s main port but the U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet also regularly docks at Haifa. A former American navy official’s warning at a 2018 conference that the U.S. might no longer be able to use the port without serious security risks undermining naval cooperation between the two countries was quoted widely and still echoes in writing on the subject. Before SIPG began operating the port however Sixth Fleet spokespersons noted that its policy remained unchanged and refused to speculate about the future. In October 2021—a month after SIPG began operations—the USS O’Kane visited in Haifa and the USS Jason Dunham followed suit in February 2022. The USS Forrest Sherman also made a port call in Haifa just a few days ago. With these stops the U.S. Navy is quietly signaling that it doesn’t see the Chinese presence at the port as a prohibitive security threat. An “all clear” statement is yet to be made and Jerusalem should not hold its breath waiting for one but instead take a cue from American deeds while continuing to take the proper security measures.

Moreover Israel may have already begun to turn away from Chinese infrastructure investment. Galia Lavi my colleague at the Glazer Center for Israel-China Policy has shown in a recently published study that in eight of the sixteen years between 2006 and 2021 Chinese companies won just one project per year and in five years won none. The zenith came in 2015 when they won five followed by 2019 in which they won four. But 2020 appears to have been a turning point: Chinese companies bid for four out of seven tenders but won just one. In 2021 they won only two small tenders and in the first half of 2022 Chinese companies contested two tenders but lost both. In fact no Chinese company has won a bid for an operating project since 2019 even if they continued to win construction projects albeit in lower numbers. This trend may reflect two points: Chinese participation in Israel’s infrastructure projects peaked in 2019 and cooled down since while construction (“build and leave”) projects are seen as entailing lower security risks than ongoing operating projects that come with long-term presence and access.

None of this seems to be a fluke. Chinese companies and their partners lost bids to manage the Ramat Hovav power plant project the Sorek 2 desalination plant and the green and purple lines in Tel Aviv’s light rail. More to the point the first two tenders were finalized just after Secretary of State Pompeo visited Israel and reportedly pressed his hosts on the matter. The Urbanix group—the consortium of three Israeli and two Chinese companies that lost the bid for the green and purple lines—filed a formal complaint in an Israeli court alleging that they had been denied the tender due to foreign pressure. Another factor at play might be the establishment in 2020 of an advisory board tasked with giving its opinion on the security aspects of foreign investment specifically created to assuage American concerns about China. Although it received harsh criticism (some of it justified) from Washington over its structural shortcomings its very existence may have had a salutary chilling effect: Chinese companies have made fewer bids on infrastructure tenders and the bodies picking the winners might be less likely to choose them to avoid risks they now better understand.

The advent of the Bennett-Lapid government in June of 2021 also appears to have accelerated the change of tone toward Beijing since Netanyahu is with good reason seen as the architect of Israel’s China policy.

The advent of the Bennett-Lapid government in June of 2021 also appears to have accelerated the change of tone toward Beijing. Netanyahu is with good reason seen as the architect of Israel’s China policy and personally championed the “marriage made in heaven” between the two countries and the “comprehensive innovation partnership” agreement they signed; he was also seen as dragging his feet in response to American demands to take relevant precautions. Prior to Naftali Bennett’s first meeting with President Biden since becoming prime minister in August 2021 his office briefed the media that his government was taking American concerns on China seriously and recognized the issue as one of national security. Yet as was the case in many spheres the Bennett government’s China policy is to be found more in quiet work than in loud statements. The national-security advisors in Jerusalem and Washington and their respective staffs took the lead in addressing the subject trying to stay out of the headlines.

With technology at the focal point of strategic competition Jerusalem and Washington are seeking to cooperate more extensively in this field. In late 2021 Communication Minister Yoaz Hendel and his U.S. counterparts agreed to establish joint working teams on 5G technologies which the Israeli press framed as part of the U.S. “tech battle with China.” National-Security Advisor Eyal Hulata’s background in technology may well facilitate such cooperation with his U.S. counterparts among them the White House senior director for technology and national security Tarun Chhabra.

And indeed on July 13 the day of President Biden’s arrival in Israel he issued a joint declaration with the caretaker prime minister Lapid about launching U.S.-Israel strategic dialogue on technology. China was not explicitly mentioned in the text but in a paragraph on “trusted tech ecosystems” the parties agreed to seek increased policy coordination on managing risks that are clearly linked to the U.S. perception of the People’s Republic as a threat. The first session of the dialogue is set to take place in the fall seeking to maintain the momentum amid Israel’s political instability.

IV. Keeping a Low Profile

Working outside of the spotlight and focusing on deeds rather than declarations is an approach that has long characterized the more successful parts of Israeli foreign policy from nuclear affairs to countering Iran. On China too Israel has avoided publicly confronting Beijing instead calling attention to areas of cooperation while addressing differences behind the scenes. The cabinet resolution that established the aforementioned advisory board on foreign investment did not mention any nation by name even though it was clearly formed in response to American concerns over China. Likewise Jerusalem never made any public statements about Chinese participation in its cellular infrastructure—a major concern for Washington when it comes to the UK and other allies—but tellingly Chinese companies have long ceased playing any role in building Israel’s cellular networks.

There are other examples. Hutchinson Whampoa a Hong Kong-based company was involved in the establishment of the Israeli cellular-service provider Partner in 1998 selling its shares in 2009 and receiving them back in 2019. That year Hutchinson requested permission from the Israeli Ministry of Communications to take control of the company. When its request went unanswered it decided to sell all its shares. In 2021 Israeli police authorities indicted several people for attempting the illegal sale of loitering munitions (including so-called “suicide drones”) to what news outlets referred to as “a country in Asia.” Only later that year did the Israeli censor apparently lift its ban on naming the buyer as China.

A similar pattern can be detected on the diplomatic front where Israel’s record is mixed regarding human rights in China. Israel joined the U.S. and other Western countries in condemning China’s treatment of the Uyghurs in June 2021 and in calling for a WHO investigation of the sources of COVID-19 but in other cases it abstained from voting on anti-China resolutions at the UN Human Rights Council perhaps to the disappointment of Washington. Jerusalem seems to use its votes as a way to signal its displeasure at Beijing’s longstanding pattern of voting against Israel in international forums especially after China’s Security Council vote against it and harsh condemnations during the May 2021 Gaza conflict. In doing so Israel can show China that it does not mindlessly follow Washington’s lead and that bilateral engagement is potentially useful. As Jerusalem prudently avoids making Beijing lose face especially on the latter’s core interests those wishing to see Israel publicly bash China shouldn’t hold their breath. In fact U.S. officials have told me that they don’t expect a public Israeli rebuke of China but would rather see Israel seriously addressing America’s concerns about influence and most importantly technology transfer.

In June 2021 the former chief of the Mossad Yossi Cohen correctly stated that “China is not Israel’s enemy” but unfortunately added that he “does not understand the U.S.’s problem with it” unsurprisingly stirring shock and anger in America. In stark contrast a January 2019 speech by Nadav Argaman then the head of Israel’s Security Agency (Shin Bet) warned against the risk of Chinese companies penetrating infrastructure and other vital areas of Israel’s economy and called for tighter legislation to safeguard Israel’s data and independence. Argaman’s words may have provided a rare look into his agency’s professional view on China. The Shin Bet whose remit includes counterespionage has the leading role in responding to foreign activity in the country. Its own risk assessment is most probably brought to the investment-oversight advisory board established a year after the speech. Israel by now recognizes that a fruitful and safe relationship with China must include measures to counteract the challenges encountered by other nations: Chinese influence efforts aimed at national and municipal politics as well as at business and academic elites cyber and traditional espionage and above all unwarranted technology transfers.

Israel by now recognizes that a fruitful and safe relationship with China must include measures to counteract Chinese influence efforts aimed at national politics as well as at business and academic elites espionage and unwarranted technology transfers.

China has candidly shown its interest in Israel’s technology as expressed in the Comprehensive Innovative Partnership signed between the countries in 2017 and much work has been done to promote this partnership since it was forged. The recent and excellent book China’s Quest for Foreign Technology: Beyond Espionage details a few dozen technology-transfer methods used by China few of which are clearly illegal while most tend to be “gray-zone” methods so called because they push the limits of legality and are neither straightforward espionage nor the innocent sharing of technology. China is reportedly employing these methods in many countries with local adaptations.

Indeed in August 2021 the cybersecurity firm FireEye reported a wide espionage campaign against Israeli entities by a Chinese group. In May 2022 another cybersecurity company Cybereason exposed a massive industrial-espionage effort against Israeli targets also attributed to China. Most probably Israel’s cybersecurity authorities have not learned of those threats from the media but are well aware of such activities. In early 2022 Israeli security agencies ramped up their enforcement efforts against what was described as a web of Chinese companies seeking to obtain defense technologies from Israel.

These examples and the aforementioned illicit attempt to export arms demonstrate that beyond the agreed-upon exchange between the countries Chinese entities engage in illegally or covertly acquiring Israeli state secrets and defense technology as well as trade secrets and intellectual property. Here China probably followed the same playbook it employs on a much larger scale in the U.S. and other Western countries combining cyberespionage with various diplomatic covert business and academic activities.

While promoting its partnership with China on agreed-upon issues Israel still must decrease its exposure to Chinese tech transfer efforts outside these boundaries. Beyond government preparedness Israel’s business and academic spheres are stakeholders on the technology-transfer front and they have much work to do as do their American counterparts. As most Israeli businesses and scholars in fact “go West”—that is they prefer to find business partners and financial backers based in the U.S. EU and other Western-leaning countries—more research is needed to ascertain the actual exposure of Israel’s technology to China.

V. The Image of China

Such changes in private attitudes of course depend on general perceptions of China and in Israel the perception is generally positive but recent years saw a change here too. Back in 2019 a Pew poll found that while 26 percent of the U.S. public held favorable views on China and 60 percent unfavorable the picture in Israel was the opposite with 66 percent favorable and 25 percent unfavorable. A recently published poll from 2022 found that Americans’ views on China have worsened since—16 percent favorable and 82 percent unfavorable—but so have Israeli views now at only 48 percent favorable and 46 percent unfavorable. Still while 70 percent in the U.S. see relations with China as bad only 19 percent think so in Israel and Israel scores last in a multi-country survey of the severity with which various populations see China’s policies on human rights its military power its economic competition and its involvement in the politics of other countries.

What then is behind the shift in the Israeli public’s attitude toward China? While empirical research is not yet available one may point to growing media coverage of negative aspects of China’s foreign policy including the dangers of its involvement in Israel’s economy and infrastructure. COVID-19 abruptly cut most travel between the two countries including business travel study and tourism severing the ongoing rapport of the last decade. China’s embassy in Tel Aviv has repeatedly overreacted to stories in the media that it saw as harming China’s image or core interests: an article on organ harvesting a flurry of hasty but false reports on alleged espionage gear in thermal cups presented by the embassy to Israeli officials and a Jerusalem Post interview with Taiwan’s foreign minister that drew the embassy’s threats against the newspaper and even reports of a threat to downgrade diplomatic relations (although it is highly doubtful that the latter was actually made). In the wake of this storm an opposition Knesset member requested that the foreign minister explain his response to China’s blunt intervention in Israel’s free speech and freedom of the press.

Clearly China’s embassy in Tel Aviv is overeager to show Beijing how assertively loyal it is in protecting the motherland’s honor while strangely expecting Israel’s press to tow its government’s line the same way the Chinese press would. In addition to the somewhat negative effect of the embassy’s overreaction China’s reputation in Israel surely does not benefit from Beijing’s growing relations with Tehran Israel’s foremost enemy and from its policy of siding with the Palestinians against Israel in its public statements which has not changed or moderated despite improving relations in other areas. But perhaps much of the shift in views on China stems from Israeli government’s public posture.

China’s embassy in Tel Aviv is overeager to show Beijing how assertively loyal it is in protecting the motherland’s honor while strangely expecting Israel’s press to tow its government’s line the same way the Chinese press would.

Whereas in the previous decade Benjamin Netanyahu had actively promoted China’s reputation in Israel touting the many benefits of improved relations—with his ministers joining in—in more recent years officials have adopted a businesslike low-profile approach to China. The Haifa Bayport inauguration ceremony in September 2021 was a mellow affair conveniently held under coronavirus restrictions with Israel’s minister of transportation attending virtually and no mention made of the Belt and Road. The 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in January 2022 was modestly celebrated with no grand events. The last decade’s honeymoon—with its enthusiastic festivities and carefree optimism—is now over and has been succeeded by more clear-eyed risk-aware and balanced conduct.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry recently characterized China-Israel relations as “current political dialogue close trade and economic relations and a variety of collaborations linking the two peoples.” The Chinese ambassador to Israel Cai Run noted that “China-Israel relations have maintained healthy and stable development and cooperation in various fields has yielded fruitful results.” Neither description carries the breathless superlatives of the previous decade and both reflect a matter-of-fact approach. Both sides now seek to continue to benefit from their relations aware of the growing constraints imposed by global dynamics. As ambassador Cai put it “China-Israel cooperation [is] an independent and voluntary choice that doesn’t target any third party nor should it be affected by any third party.” In other words China is well aware of America’s influence on Israel’s choices yet still hopes to continue working with Israel in areas unaffected by great-power competition.

How does this look from Washington? In his May 26 2022 speech about the Biden administration’s approach to the People’s Republic of China (“invest align compete”) Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “We don’t expect every country to have the exact same assessment of China as we do. We know that many countries—including the United States—have vital economic or people-to-people ties with China that they want to preserve. This is not about forcing countries to choose. It’s about giving them a choice.” Visiting Israel last June Blinken’s deputy for global Asia Jung H. Pak stressed that the administration is engaging Israel and other allies and partners to ensure that “they are in the driver’s seat in their relationships with the PRC” and helping them find ways to become more resilient against China’s less benign activities.

Unlike the op-eds exhorting Israel to “choose” between the U.S. and China to “cool down” or “break up” with it the White House in Blinken’s words is “consulting with [its] partners listening to them taking their concerns to heart building solutions that address their unique challenges and priorities” supported by a “growing convergence about the need to approach relations with Beijing with more realism.” This convergence may well explain the developments in Israel-China and Israel-U.S. relations described above as each of the three parties adopt a more realistic approach.

Israel and China both recognize that the golden age of the previous decade is over but also understand that a great deal of mutually beneficial cooperation is still possible in the circumstance of the 2020s. At the same time Israeli policymakers realize that managing relations with Beijing doesn’t only involve assuaging American concerns but also facing direct challenges to Israel’s security. Secretary Blinken spoke about “Beijing’s efforts to gain access to sensitive technologies data or critical infrastructure; compromise our supply chains; or dominate key strategic sectors.” Those efforts are real and officials in Jerusalem understand the potential risk to Israel from gray-zone technology transfers the theft of data economic dependency and potential supply-chain problems. A rosy-eyed and carefree approach has gradually given way to a more sober one in Washington as well as in Jerusalem.

There remains much work to be done in order to develop expertise and more importantly to build trust and to reassure Israel’s partners in America that it takes their concerns seriously and is seizing the initiative in proactively addressing them. To the frustration of the Cassandras Israel won’t be breaking up with China anytime soon just as the U.S. isn’t considering doing so itself. In other words the Jewish state has drawn realistic conclusions rooted in a recognition of both the risks and the benefits presented by China and structures its policy accordingly. Likewise Jerusalem doesn’t have to choose between Washington and Beijing because it’s already chosen the former. It is taking steps to mitigate the effects of China’s unsavory practices and the risks posed by its conduct although like many other countries it will need to continue to modify and improve upon these steps. And as it does more it won’t be with headline-making announcements but with behind-the-scenes shifts. Nobody should rest easy but rather than panic it’s most prudent for Israel to proceed calmly and deliberately together with its friends and allies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjNy5jb20vbG9zdC1hcnQtbWVkdXNhLW1vc2FpYy1yb21hbi1pdGFsaWFuLzEyMTk5Nzk1L9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjNy5jb20vYW1wL2xvc3QtYXJ0LW1lZHVzYS1tb3NhaWMtcm9tYW4taXRhbGlhbi8xMjE5OTc5NS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2000-year-old lost Roman mosaic of Medusa found in good shape and returned to Italy,"2000-year-old lost Roman mosaic of Medusa found in good shape and returned to Italy

Hidden for decades a mosaic that is a ""key part of Rome's history"" was located and returned to the Italian government.

Hidden for decades a mosaic that is a ""key part of Rome's history"" was located and returned to the Italian government the Federal Bureau of Investigations said in a news release on Friday.

In 2020 an attorney contacted the FBI Art Crime Team on behalf of an anonymous client who was in possession of an enormous ""mosaic of the mythological figure Medusa"" the FBI said.

The mosaic had been cut into 16 pieces each weighing between 75 to 200 pounds and had been individually stored in pallets kept inside a Los Angeles storage unit since the 1980s according to the FBI.

""The client had no documentation -- known in the art world as provenance -- so they could not sell the pieces"" the FBI wrote. ""Selling art without provenance is the equivalent of trying to sell a car when you don't have its title.""

It is unclear how the anonymous client came into possession of the artwork or how long it had been in the US although the FBI says ""it may have been lost for as long as 100 years.""

Two special agents -- Elizabeth Rivas and Allen Grove -- worked to discover the origin of the mosaic so that it could be returned to its rightful owners.

Italian police force confirmed the mosaic was Italian and had ""been entered into cultural property records in 1909"" the FBI said. ""The only modern record of the mosaic's existence was a 1959 newspaper ad that appeared to show it for sale in the Los Angeles area.""

""The mosaic was handcrafted from an age where people put an amazing amount of care and effort into it. It really speaks to the ingenuity and creativity of the time"" Grove said. ""It's not meant to be in Los Angeles. The mosaic belongs to the people of Rome. It allows us to understand a bit about the history of humans 2000 years ago.""

Officials from Italy traveled to Los Angeles to inspect the mosaic and help plan the best way to get it back to Rome.

To ensure the artifact arrived in Italy without damage the anonymous client covered the costs of the specialized shipping crates that were then sent through diplomatic channels. The artwork arrived safely in April the FBI confirmed.

Art experts in Italy are currently in the process of cleaning and restoring the mosaic. While some of the storing pallets had been infested with termites the artwork pieces were ""largely intact thanks to the climate-controlled facility they'd been kept in"" the FBI said.

There is an ongoing effort in the US to repatriate cultural artifacts being sold often illegally to private collectors or museums.

Dozens of ancient artifacts investigators believe to have been looted were seized from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. Officials have also returned stolen antiquities worth nearly $14 million to Italy in July including dozens of artifacts seized from US billionaire Michael Steinhardt.

In 2021 the Met returned three African art objects including a pair of 16th-century Benin brass plaques to Nigeria. The move came after European museums started facing mounting pressure to return the irreplaceable artifacts plundered during colonial times.

That distinction went to Johann “The Viking Giant” Petursson who was 7 feet 8 inches tall.

But Tomaini had Gibsonton’s largest presence.

He owned a restaurant and television repair shop gave the town its first ambulance and served as fire chief and a deputy.

When he died in 1962 his wife Jeanie placed Tomaini’s 35-inch boot on a pillar outside their home as a memorial.

The boot eventually deteriorated and the community replaced it with a replica sculpture.

But the sculpture also deteriorated and a year ago fell from its pedestal. The damaged monument was taken home by the daughter of the woman who led the charge to have it erected.

She fixed and returned it to the pedestal in July.

“We couldn’t let it disappear” said Athena Philips who restored the sculpture. “The boot is this iconic piece of Gibsonton that reminds us of how it was.”

Philips would not share her age but said she is too young to have met Tomaini. As a child she met his wife in passing.

Still through stories “I feel like I knew them” she said.

The history of Gibsonton’s sideshow community according to the Showmen’s Museum in neighboring Riverview goes like this:

In the 1920s Eddie and Grace Lemay stopped in Gibsonton while on the road to South Florida with their portable restaurant which traveled the carnival circuit. They caught a fish so quickly that they decided to make Gibsonton home.

They told carnival friends about the town and in a short period it became known as Sideshow Capital of the World.

Residents included 138 entertainers known back then as human oddities. They included a Monkey Girl an Alligator-Skinned Man and Tomaini and his wife Jeanie called The Living Half Girl due to being born without legs and being 2 feet 5 inches tall. Together they were billed as The Strangest Married Couple in the World.

They were also entrepreneurial. In the early 1940s they established Giant’s Fish Camp which included a restaurant bait house and cottages one of which was their home.

Jeanie died in 1999 but Tomaini’s boot remained out front “until it just disappeared one day” Philips said.

When the Tomaini property was sold to phosphate company Mosaic in 2008 “the pillar and boot remains were found wrecked presumably by a car plowing into it” said Philips who was raised in Gibsonton and in the sideshow business. Her parents Carol and Don Philips had an animal act that included trained wolves and unicycle tricks.

“My mom kept hearing people say ‘What happened to the boot?’ and thought something of its obvious significance should be maintained for posterity” Philips said. “So she spearheaded a campaign with the Concerned Citizens of Gibsonton to install a new monument honoring Al and Jeanie.”

Artist Lew Stamm crafted the replica boot. Its base was engraved “Al & Jeanie Tomaini Gibsonton Civic Leaders.” And in 2010 Mosaic allowed it to be placed on the property in front of the former camp’s last cabin.

“When they commemorated the new monument memorial they presented the sole from the real boot framed and mounted to the Tomaini family” Philips said.

Meanwhile Philips remained in the sideshow business most recently running a snake show with her husband Pete Kolozsy. The pandemic halted that show so they are now seeking to start a Traveling Museum of Historical Attractions.

“Kind of like a ‘Ripley’s Believe It or Not!’” she said. “I’m into the history. It’s why the boot matters to me.”

In August 2021 Philips who now lives in Citrus County received a call from her sister Diane Philips informing her that the boot had been knocked over.

“My husband and I swung by and sure enough it’s on the ground and it was banged up” Philips said. “It’s possible it was vandalism but I think it was just age and deterioration and eventually a good wind came and knocked it over. We were worried it could get more damaged so we took it home.”

With Mosaic’s permission and financial support Philips repaired the cracks and chips on the sculpture and replaced the interior sculpting foam that had been eaten by ants.

Then on July 3 Philips and her husband remounted the boot.

“It’s back where it belongs” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3eW9ya3lpbWJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L2xwYy1hcHByb3Zlcy1yZW5vdmF0aW9ucy1hdC0zMi1hdmVudWUtb2YtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FzLWluLXRyaWJlY2EtbWFuaGF0dGFuLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LPC Approves Renovations at 32 Avenue of the Americas in Tribeca Manhattan,"The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) has approved proposals to complete ground-floor renovations and lighting enhancements on 32 Avenue of the Americas a 27-story Art Deco office tower in Tribeca. Completed in 1932 by Ralph Thomas Walker of Voorhees Gmelin and Walker the building features a landmarked façade and lobby with extensive mosaic murals by Hildreth Meière.

Rudin Management Company current owner of the office building has retained Fogarty Finger to design and complete the proposed enhancements. Scope of work includes the installation of new glass doors and new lighting behind a brass-finned lightbox at the Sixth Avenue entrance. The renderings also illustrate new glass doors and integrated lighting along Church Street.

Drawings reveal the installation of additional modern uplights in the floor to supplement the existing wall sconces which will be relamped. The Sixth Avenue entrance will also receive multiple inlay LED floor strips to illuminate the historic mosaic murals and subway entrance.

In voting to approve the proposal the LPC stipulated that the project team must install horizontal push bars similar to existing conditions and modify the number of lighting installations and level of brightness within the lobby. Once the commissioners receive final drawings for the approved work a Certificate of Appropriateness allowing the project to break ground will be issued.

The immune system’s B cells which generate specific antibodies are likely to find and bind to at least some of these conserved pieces of the virus which remain unchanged on new variants. Thus the B cells will make antibodies effective against even previously unseen variants.

To make their mosaic nanoparticle Cohen Bjorkman and their collaborators chose proteins from the surfaces of 12 coronaviruses identified by other research groups and detailed in the scientific literature. These included the viruses that caused the first SARS outbreak and the one that causes covid-19 but also non-human viruses found in bats in China Bulgaria and Kenya. For good measure they also threw in a coronavirus found in a scaly anteater known as a pangolin. All the strains had already been genetically sequenced by other groups and share 68 to 95% of the same genomic material. Thus Cohen and Bjorkman could be relatively sure that at least some portions of each distinct spike protein they chose to place on the exterior of their nanoparticle would be shared by some of the other viruses.

The key to the universal vaccine is the mosaic nanoparticle with so many different viral fragments clustered in close proximity on its surface.

Then they made three vaccines. One for comparison purposes had all 60 slots occupied by particles taken from a single strain of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes covid-19. The other two were mosaics each one displaying a mix of protein fragments taken from eight of the 12 bat human and pangolin coronavirus strains. The remaining four strains were left off the vaccine so the researchers could test whether it would protect against them anyway.

In mouse studies all three vaccines bound equally well to the covid-19 virus. But when Cohen sat down to look at his results he was shocked at how much more powerfully the mosaic nanoparticles performed when exposed to different strains of coronavirus not represented on the spikes they had been exposed to.

The vaccine was triggering the production of armies of antibodies to attack the parts of the proteins that changed least among the different strains of coronavirus—the parts in other words that are conserved.

New era

In recent months Bjorkman Cohen and their collaborators have been testing out the vaccine in monkeys as well as rodents. So far it seems to be working. Some of the experiments proceeded slowly because they had to be done by overseas collaborators in special high-security biosafety labs designed to ensure that highly contagious viruses do not escape. But when the results finally appeared in Science the paper received widespread attention.

Other promising efforts are moving in parallel. At the University of Washington’s Institute of Protein Design biochemist Neil King has custom-designed hundreds of new types of nanoparticles “sculpting them atom by atom” he says in such a way that the atoms self-assemble attracted to the correct positions by other pieces engineered to carry complimentary geometric and chemical charges. In 2019 King's collaborator Barney Graham at NIH was the first to successfully demonstrate that mosaic nanoparticles could be effective against different flu strains. King Graham and collaborators formed a company to modify and develop the technique and they have a nanoparticle influenza vaccine in phase 1 clinical trials. They are now deploying the new technology against a variety of different viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Despite the recent promising developments Bjorkman warns that her vaccine likely won’t protect us from all coronaviruses. There are four families of coronaviruses each a little different from the next and some target entirely different receptors in human cells. Thus there are fewer sites conserved across coronavirus families. The vaccine from her lab focuses on a universal vaccine for the sarbecovirus the subfamily that contains SARS coronaviruses and SARS-coV-2."

Industry 4.0’s new branch of video analytics has changed how surveillance privacy and security were perceived and used in the past. They have grown in prominence in both the public and private sectors because they protect people and their assets. The development of video analytics and related techniques had made it possible to identify and stop hostile activity before it got something to do any harm.

Video analytics have aided in interpreting the footage to create effective algorithms that produce intelligent data aiding in decision-making processes as opposed to the loose unorganised set of data that video footages of video surveillance systems were.

By identifying patterns and producing outputs they have been able to considerably reduce the weaknesses of security systems. Video analytics are now widely used in all industries. The best Indian firms for video analytics will be examined in this post.

This is the reverse of what is happening in the investment world. Instead of “He Who Cannot Be Named” the acronym ESG is being said repeatedly and made the villain despite its limited impact particularly in the ETF space.

I came back last week from a vacation in England and realized that rarely a business day went by in August when the acronym ESG was not in the news or my Twitter feed in a divisive way. We had Florida and Texas ban companies for their ESG considerations; Strive launched an energy ETF to push back what it claimed was stakeholder capitalism by asset managers like BlackRock; asset manager Inspire dropped the word “ESG” from its suite of ETFs citing “flames of intolerance”; and my friends and fellow ETF nerds Nate Geraci and Eric Balchunas shared data that shows many popular ESG ETFs have a high correlation to the S&P 500 Index meaning the ETF performance was similar to the widely popular non-ESG strategies.

Before we dive in with some facts I should note that my VettaFi colleagues Karie Gordon and Dave Nadig wrote an excellent piece “Is ESG Screaming Into the Void.” The commentary starts by stating “Few topics are more polarizing at a cocktail party full of the investor class than anything related to environmental social or governance (ESG) informed investing.”

I waited till now to spell out what Voldemort – I mean ESG – stands for because the acronym’s overuse has masked what we are really talking about. When many people complain about ESG they focus solely on the Environmental (E) pillar particularly climate change but often nothing else.

The ESG ETF universe includes funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN A+) Invesco Solar ETF (TAN C+) and SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (SPYX A-) but also many other products. Indeed there are 186 ESG ETFs per VettaFi as of the end of August or approximately 6% of the universe. Many ETFs take company attributes tied to the Social or Governance pillars solely or in combination with Environmental traits into account.

Indeed eight of the ten largest ESG ETFs take a broad index-based approach including the IShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU A-) the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA A) and the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV A-). Other targeted ESG ETFs that focus beyond the Environmental pillar include the Global X S&P 500 Catholic Values ETF (CATH B+) the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE B-) and the WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-State Owned Enterprises Fund (XSOE A).

So what makes a fund an ESG one? Well most of the ETFs track an index that uses unique criteria. However the below is pulled from the MSCI index methodology showcasing the broad approach with ten notable themes and 35 key issues. Texas used MSCI’s ESG scoring to put together its fossil-fuel boycott list.

The themes used by MSCI include climate change pollution and waste human capital product liability and corporate behavior. Meanwhile the issues list consists of carbon emissions toxic emissions & waste health & safety of employees privacy & data security consumer financial protection business ethics board representation and others. Even within each pillar each company is scored for many attributes before being added to the portfolio; not just one focused on climate change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHhldGZzLmNvbS9jaGluYS1zZWN0b3Itb3V0bG9vay1xMy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Sector Outlook: Q3 2022 – Global X ETFs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.globalxetfs.com/china-sector-outlook-q3-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHhldGZzLmNvbS9jaGluYS1zZWN0b3Itb3V0bG9vay1xMy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnN0cmVhbS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYXhhLWltLWVudGVycy1ldXJvcGVhbi1ldGYtbWFya2V0LXdpdGgtYWN0aXZlLXJhbmdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AXA IM enters European ETF market with active range,"AXA Investment Managers has made its long-awaited entry into the European ETF market with the launch of a new platform focusing on active thematic ETFs.

The French asset manager which has been hotly tipped to enter the market since it appointed Brieuc Louchard as head of capital markets in March said it will start its ETF journey with the launch of two strategies targeting biodiversity and the climate.

The actively-managed AXA IM ACT Biodiversity Equity UCITS ETF (ABIU) will list today on Deutsche Boerse while the AXA IM ACT Climate Equity UCITS ETF will follow “in a couple of weeks” Hans Stoter global head of AXA IM Core told ETF Stream.

Both ETFs will be benchmarked against the MSCI AC World Total Return Net index and have total expense ratios (TER) of 0.70%.

ABIU will align four of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; clean water and sanitation responsible consumption and production life below water and life on land.

Both the biodiversity ETF and the climate ETF will be labelled Article 9 under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). AXA IM described the products as impact ETFs in that they have the dual objective of delivering long-term financial growth and a positive measurable impact on the environment.

The firm added the ETF range will leverage its existing portfolio management team to select stocks for each strategy.

Do active ETF divestment powers give them an edge in ESG?

Commenting on the launch of its new platform Stoter (pictured) said the evolution of the ETFs means it is the opportune moment to enter the market.

“With the ETF market now evolving beyond what has historically been passive indexing to more customised index tracking and now active investment strategies. For us it is the opportune moment to bring active strategies in an ETF wrapper to our client base” he continued.

“We are taking our investment strategies especially those with a strong focus on responsible investing and introducing them to our buyer base that are interested in the benefits of ETFs.”

He added the ETF wrapper’s enhanced liquidity and transparency make it an attractive proposition to sit aside the firm’s mutual fund offering.

Active ETFs is a growing area of the European ETF market with JP Morgan Asset Management Fidelity and Invesco all expanding their active ranges this year.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence there are currently 45 active ETFs in Europe which house $15.8bn of assets under management (AUM) although this is growing rapidly.

Marco Morelli executive chairman of AXA IM added: “To meet the changing demands of investors we must continue to innovate and enhance our investment offering and through the launch of this new platform we do this by combining our active investment insight with the flexibility of an ETF.

“With the support of AXA and leveraging our key strengths primarily within active management and responsible investing strategies this platform will complement our existing fund range while answering client demand for ETF structured vehicles.”

In June AXA IM gave its biggest hint yet that it would be entering the ETF space after it said the ETF wrapper would be “attractive” to its clients.

In reality the French asset manager’s ETF proposition had been a year in the making.

“We identified that strategic opportunity about a year ago and started to plan our platform. We wanted to bring it to life ourselves and have full control over what we do and how we do it” Stoter said.

AXA IM said the range will not initially be registered in the UK while it “assesses demand for actively managed ETF strategies”.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be very effective ways to get access to some of the world's biggest and best businesses. The Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF (ASX: VGS) could be one of the cheapest ways to do it with an annual management fee of just 0.18%.

It's pretty easy to buy shares on the ASX that we use in our day-to-day lives like Telstra Corporation Ltd (ASX: TLS) Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW) or Transurban Group (ASX: TCL).

However it's not so simple to buy shares of global names directly because they are not listed on the ASX.

It's still possible to buy shares in them directly but it could come with more paperwork. An ETF may be the easiest way to gain access to them.

But what shares does the VGS ETF actually own?

Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF holdings

At 31 July 2022 it had 1474 positions. That's a lot of businesses giving great diversification.

But some of them have a much larger allocation in the portfolio than others.

These are the biggest 10 positions at the end of July 2022 in the VGS ETF:

Apple Inc makes the iPhone Mac computer and many other well-known tech products and services.

Microsoft Corporation is another technology giant that offers various products and services like Windows Microsoft 365 products Xbox and Azure.

Alphabet Inc is the holding company for many services including YouTube Google Search Google Maps and Android.

Amazon.com Inc is a huge e-commerce giant that also has other services like Twitch Prime Video and AWS.

Tesla Inc is a leading electric vehicle and battery business that is diversifying into other areas.

UnitedHealth Group is a healthcare and insurance business.

Johnson & Johnson is a global healthcare product and pharmaceutical business.

NVIDIA Corporation designs graphics processing units (GPUs) and it's involved in a number of other tech services. It's also involved in the hardware and software for AI.

Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest oil businesses.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc is an American-focused conglomerate led by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.

Investors may have heard of some or all of these businesses. They are the biggest positions in the VGS ETF portfolio so they will have the largest influence on the returns.

For example if Apple were 10% of the portfolio and it went up 20% in one month that would be a 2% boost for the ETF. If a smaller company comprised 1% of the portfolio and it went up 100% it would only add 1% of a total return.

Is the BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF the best index fund on the ASX?

The ASX boards are home to many an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Many of these are index fund ETFs some are not. But the BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ) arguably makes a case to be one of the best if not the best index funds on the ASX.

There are a few minor reasons — and one major reason — we can make this assessment.

So the BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF covers the NASDAQ-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX). This index tracks the largest 100 companies on the US NASDAQ stock exchange by market capitalisation.

Rather unusually the US has not one but two major stock exchanges. The NASDAQ is famous for housing many of the 'newer' tech-heavy companies on the US markets and holds almost all the major US tech companies that we all know. Apple Microsoft Netflix Amazon Alphabet Tesla Meta Platforms PayPal and Adobe shares can all be found on the NASDAQ exchange.

This inherently gives investors a simple investment that gives broad exposure to some of the best and most dominant tech shares in the world – the types of shares that are simply unavailable on the ASX.

Many of the NASDAQ's top holdings are also globally dominant. Think of how many countries the likes of Apple Alphabet and Netflix serve. So the Betashares NASDAQ ETF is certainly more than just a US-focused fund.

How does the BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF measure up?

But let's talk about performance – this ETF's most compelling claim in its candidacy for 'the ASX's best index fund'.

The BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF has taken a substantial hit in recent months. The ETF's units are still down by almost 24.5% year to date.

However despite this the BetaShares NASDAQ ETF has still averaged a return of 16.44% per annum over the past three years as of 31 August. Over the past five years it has averaged 19.21% per annum.

That runs rings around the vast majority of other ASX index funds on the ASX. The popular Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) has managed an average of just 8.12% per annum over the past five years.

The iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV) has averaged a close-but-no-cigar 17.62% per annum over the same period. While the Vanguard MSCI International Shares Index ETF (ASX: VGS) is further away with its five-year average of 11.95% per annum.

So the BetaShares NASDAQ 100 ETF's performance dominates all of these other popular index funds. As such together with its broad exposure to globally-dominant tech companies this ETF makes a fine case for being the best index fund on the ASX."

Williams Is Helping Families Build and Navigate Generational Wealth,"Thomasina H. Williams Founder and Principal Consultant at Sankofa Legacy Advisors Inc. is partnering with business-owning families to catalyze more connected and capable individuals across generations.

After learning there was an emerging industry dedicated to supporting families who were in business together Thomasina left her successful law career to pivot into this new field. Having personal experience with trying to create generational wealth it was a subject near and dear to Thomasina's heart. Though her family was unsuccessful in generating that stability—as 70 percent of families lose their wealth by the end of the third generation—Thomasina now supports and empowers business-owning families in building stronger relationships to ensure better decisions are made families flourish and financial wealth can survive across many generations.

We asked Thomasina how her upbringing has shaped how she operates as an entrepreneur her biggest accomplishments throughout her journey and why she believes leadership is about managing yourself first.

Q: Tell us the story behind your company's founding. How and why did you start working on Sankofa Legacy Advisors Inc.?

A: When I learned that there is an emerging field of professionals who help families navigate the complexities of combining family and finances I switched careers and went all in to figure out how to help my own family course correct and how to be a valuable resource for other families. We aim to focus on the people and their relationships while others focus on their property. Our priority is the people who are the owners and beneficiaries of family financial resources. We leave it to other professionals to manage the resources.

Our superpower is helping families reimagine what’s possible and walking alongside them as a strategic thought partner facilitator coach and guide to explore the possibilities. As a result they’re able to see themselves and their situation differently be more deliberate than reactive when difficulties arise talk with each other about sensitive subjects and make tough decisions while preserving and strengthening their relationships. We take a human systems approach to our work which helps families appreciate that every person exists within a context that connects them to others and gives meaning to their circumstances.

Picture one of the stock images of networks that we see everywhere these days. There are always lines connecting the people. This is because what one person does impacts others. Families are connected in the same way. It’s just that their connections are invisible. Families automatically react to and influence each other’s behavior without realizing it. We help them see what’s happening recognize predictable patterns and work with them to disrupt patterns that are not serving them well.

By taking a systems approach we view our client as the family enterprise ecosystem not any one individual or group of individuals. Regardless of who hires us and who pays our fee we are a neutral third-party helping families to see each other’s perspectives tap into their innate wisdom and explore possibilities they couldn’t see or weren’t equipped to pursue on their own.

Q: What problem does Sankofa Legacy Advisors Inc. solve?

A: Conventional wisdom says that the way to sustain generational wealth is to maximize financial assets and leverage estate planning. Yet families’ most precious assets are not quantifiable. In addition to their operating businesses family offices family foundations real estate and other financial investments families want to preserve their relationships and the history traditions and values that define and shape who they are. These intangible assets are priceless. They’re also areas where families need help that they don’t generally get from the advisors who manage their financial assets. Moreover research shows that when families are not attentive to what I refer to as “the family side” of family wealth and family business they risk both losing their financial wealth and fracturing their family relationships.

Q: In what ways has your upbringing or past experiences contributed to how you operate as an entrepreneur?

A: My maternal grandmother Gussie Bellamy bought real estate in her own name in 1943—quite a feat for a woman of any race in 1943 and especially for a Black woman in the segregated South who had little formal education. My grandfather Wes Bellamy could not read and he could not write. Yet they were a formidable pair with innate entrepreneurial skills. They were citrus growers who owned other businesses and accumulated real estate holdings.

Today the entire neighborhood where I grew up bears my grandparents’ name— “Bellamy Heights Park.” They would be proud to know that local government officials voluntarily chose to honor them and their impact on our community in this way. They would also be devastated to know that the only thing that remains of the financial wealth that they worked so hard to create is the six acres that was once their homestead. And it’s vacant non-income producing land. My grandparents assumed like many wealth creators that their wealth would sustain their family for generations well beyond mine. Unfortunately that didn’t prove to be the case.

It was decades after my grandparents’ deaths that I learned about the “shirtsleeves-to- shirtsleeves-in-three-generations” phenomena by which 70 percent of families lose their wealth by the end of the third generation. Although the original research that gave rise to the 70 percent loss rate has been widely criticized another study where the researchers interviewed 3250 families who had undergone generational wealth transitions found the same 70 percent failure rate.

The latter study looked at the reasons that families are challenged to sustain their wealth across extended generations despite the best financial and legal advice that money can buy. The research shows that the biggest challenges for families are navigating their relationships—relationships individual family members have with themselves with each other and with money which remains a taboo topic. As families grow in numbers and are increasingly more geographically dispersed and culturally socially and politically diverse it requires greater intentionality and effort to keep them together and aligned on how to manage their shared assets.

In my family’s case the number of joint decision-makers increased from just my grandparents to their ten direct heirs with a wide age span and varying levels of education and sophistication as well as other differences. I’ve experienced first-hand how the intertwining of family and finances magnifies the complexities that most families are ill-equipped to navigate on their own. As a consequence financial assets were lost and family relationships were fractured. It’s why family leadership development and helping families cultivate their individual and collective capabilities has become both my personal passion and professional mission.

Q: We dare you to brag: What achievements are you most proud of?

A: I’ve been fortunate over the course of my three careers to have had several significant milestones. I have also received a number of personal accolades starting with my time practicing law for nearly 20 years. I had a prestigious clerkship with a federal appellate judge. I then went on to become a partner in what at the time was one of the largest full-service law firms in Florida in three years. After another four years I left the large law firm and co-founded the first Black-owned law firm in Miami with a primarily corporate clientele. It was written up in the Business section of the Miami Herald.

I’m honored to have been recognized in those days by the South Florida Legal Journal as one of the “Top 250 Lawyers in South Florida” the only Black attorney and one of only 14 women attorneys to be so acknowledged. The Miami-Dade County Commission named a day in my honor to recognize my pro bono legal work before the Florida Supreme Court in a case of statewide significance and one of the local bar associations gave me a “Living Legend Award” for pivotal work I’ve done in the community.

As it relates to my current career I’m honored to have been the first “Family Dynamics Consultant” that Wells Fargo Private Bank hired to come in-house and play a leadership role in building a new line of business to help its ultra-high net worth clients navigate family relationships generational wealth and business transitions.

What I’m most proud of though is the positive transformative impact I’ve made in the lives of other people in all three of my careers. In my work with families that impact includes a client saying repeatedly what a “gift” it was for her and her family to have worked with me.

Q: Have you discovered any underappreciated leadership traits or misconceptions around leadership?

A: I think the biggest misconception about leadership is that it’s primarily about other people. The term “leadership” is most often used in reference to leading others. In my view the most important person to lead is yourself. Leading yourself includes being able to manage yourself in stressful situations and be deliberate rather than reactive. It means being able to see the big picture and your role in each situation to appreciate the significance of context and to identify patterns.

Leading yourself means mustering the courage to take a stand to say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done to have difficult conversations and make tough decisions. Whether you’re dealing with your family your work team or a professional organization the better you’re able to manage yourself the more effective you can be in leading others.

Q: What have you learned about building a team and a support network around yourself?

A: Decades ago the federal appellate judge with whom I clerked as an aspiring lawyer told me to always hire people who are smarter than I am. I’ve tried to follow his advice and hire people who are smarter than I am in certain aspects of my business and then empower them to do their thing. In addition to a skilled team it’s important to have people to turn to who can help me think more clearly more deeply and bigger. None of us can do what we do and excel on our own. We all need both an internal team and an external network to support us challenge us walk alongside us encourage us and push us when we need it.

Q: What would you tell your younger self if you were to start your entrepreneurial journey all over again?

A: I would tell my younger self to trust myself more. I do in fact know enough know more than I realize and often know more than others in my area of expertise. At the same time I’m not supposed to have all the answers. If I ever get to a point where I think I know it all I’m more likely in trouble.

Q: What’s next for you and Sankofa Legacy Advisors Inc.?

A: I’m most excited about two things that we’re working on. We’re building a growing network of consultants who have deep expertise in a range of areas to better serve families and their advisors. Our team has expertise that includes social impact investing and philanthropy; corporate strategy finance and innovation; family business operations and transitions; family systems and learning; health care and well-being as well as individual and group coaching leadership development and team building.

We’re also piloting a leadership development program for women in business-owning families and families of wealth called “The FEW: Family Enterprise Women™.” It’s an online training group coaching and community experience designed to support women in pursuing their personal purpose and passions while also simplifying and navigating the complexities of combining family and finances.

By Kiran N. Kumar

With his appointment as global coffee giant Starbucks’ next CEO Indian-born Laxman Narasimhan has joined a select group of Indian American CEOs heading US companies and steering them with a huge global reach.

They include Sundar Pichai who heads Google and its parent company Alphabet Microsoft’s Satya Nadella IBM’s Arvind Krishna Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen Twitter’s Parag Agrawal Albertsons’ Vivek Sankaran Micron Technology’s Sanjay Mehrotra FedEx’s Raj Subramaniam and NetApp’s George Kurian.

Read: Meet the top 7 Indian Americans CEOs in corporate America (November 30 2021)

The demand for Indian-Americans as CEOs of multinationals has rekindled new interest in their multicultural exposure and dedication to drive the growth of a global company reflecting in several studies being undertaken in management schools.

A report stated that seven top companies currently headed by them earned over $530 billion in 2020 greater than the GDP of all but 40 countries.

The situation was different three decades ago when there were very few Indian Americans in the top echelons of corporate America until the glass ceiling was broken in the mid-1990s by Raj Gupta Ramani Ayer and Rakesh Gangwal and Sanjay Mehrotra.

Gupta served as the Chairman and CEO of Rohm & Haas which was later acquired by Dow Chemicals for more than a decade.

Ayer served as the CEO and Chairman of The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. from 1997 to 2009. Gangwal was the president and CEO of the US Airways Group from 1998 to 2001.

Then in 2001 PepsiCo named Indra Nooyi as its CEO and she became the first Indian American woman to head a Fortune 100 company.

Six years later Vikram Pandit would start his tenure as CEO at Citigroup. Today Indian Americans hold top-level positions in as many US companies across a spectrum of industries.

The following is a list of ten Indian American CEOs who are leading some top US companies.

Today’s column is by Humphrey Ho managing director Americas Hylink Digital.

In mid-July Netflix announced a partnership with Microsoft selecting the tech giant for its new advertising and sales agency. Odd right? The obvious choice was Google especially with the push for cookieless data. But there’s more than meets the eye to this partnership.

To start Netflix will have access to Microsoft’s entire bundle including cloud storage access to consoles and user data. Through this partnership Netflix will be able to target the right audience without third-party user data when it launches ads in 2023 all while Microsoft stands to acquire Netflix and gain access to its massive library of content.

But let’s back up and break down this trajectory.

Setting the stage for change

Starting early next year Netflix will update its subscription options to include a cheaper ad-based service while potentially increasing the prices of its standard subscription. The reason? Netflix is bleeding money because it lost 200 thousand users in quarter one of this year. Stocks immediately dropped by 35%. And in the past six months they’ve plummeted even further by 42%. In short Netflix is struggling.

Bundling for more perks

Microsoft will not only give Netflix ad servicing but also the cloud storage it needs for its library of over 5000 TV show and movie options.

Currently Netflix uses Amazon’s AWS for cloud storage. With Microsoft Azure Netflix may no longer need AWS. That’ll save the streaming service money on cloud costs.

Plus with Microsoft Netflix can meaningfully enter the gaming space. As of July 2022 there are only 22 games available on Netflix mostly for mobile devices. By the end of 2022 Netflix plans to offer 50 games. But with Microsoft by its side Netflix’s gaming potential grows massively – the company gains access to Activision Blizzard the powerhouse behind “Call of Duty” “World of Warcraft” and others. And with Microsoft’s pending acquisition of Activision there’s an even greater wealth of content that Netflix could tap into to produce shows movies and spin-off games.

Activision also gives Netflix the opportunity to enter the virtual reality space. Already the US Department of Defense uses Microsoft’s Xbox software and gaming console to train soldiers with HoloLens. The opportunities for Netflix are huge. Virtual Netflix-branded movie theaters anyone?

Microsoft and Netflix: A desperate duo?

By aligning with Microsoft Netflix is setting itself up for an acquisition preventing impending financial doom and giving Microsoft the reins to rebuild usership.

As for Microsoft the partnership will provide the missing piece of content creation that it desperately sought with the launch of Xbox Entertainment Studios. This attempt to make TV content for Xbox and Microsoft users failed but Netflix can help Microsoft right its own ship.

This also adds 221 million users to Microsoft’s advertising network which has traditionally struggled behind Google and Meta and helps Microsoft create a moat in advertising following in the footsteps of Apple with its Search Ads business.

Clearly there’s something in it for both players.

The company was initially planning to start offering the service in 2023 but Variety reported last week it had been bumped to 1 November in order to get ahead of Disney+’s planned launch of an ad-supported tier in December.

According to reports Netflix’s service will launch in the US France Germany Australia and Canada among other places and is expected to be priced between US$7 and $9. The most basic Netflix subscription now costs US$9.99 or $15.49 for a standard subscription.

The ad tier would be additional to the existing tiers meaning current subscribers would not see any ads on Netflix.

A spokesperson for Netflix said the company had not made any decisions yet.

“We are still in the early days of deciding how to launch a lower priced ad-supported option and no decisions have been made” they said. “So this is all just speculation at this point.”

In July Netflix reported a loss of 1 million subscribers for the second quarter of 2022 its second quarter of loss of subscribers with shares falling 67% to the end of July.

On the investor call in July the company’s chief operations and product officer Greg Peters revealed the company’s thinking behind introducing advertising to support lower-fee subscriptions.

He said Netflix wants to “provide an incredible experience for consumers … who choose to take the ad-supported offering but also provide an incredible experience for brands and advertisers who want to work with us to make sure that we’re doing a good job of elevating what that looks like for them”.

He said he was optimistic that advertising on Netflix can “deliver an experience which is fundamentally different from the ad experience” on broadcast or cable television today.

The launch would focus on countries where there were “more mature ad markets” Peters said at the time.

Netflix announced in July it would partner with Microsoft for the ad technology and as a sales partner globally. The Variety report suggested the two companies are seeking US$65 cost for a thousand views seeking a minimum US$10m annual ad spend commitment from companies now and touting the company can get 500000 subscribers on the ad-supported tier by the end of 2022.

Peters told investors in July there had been “a lot of excitement” in early discussions with advertising agencies.

“I think for them … they’ve wanted to connect with the titles incredible content that [Netflix chief executive Ted Sandros’s] team was putting out there” he said. “And I think we also share a perspective on what is a great experience for consumers and for advertisers.

“So when you think about the kind of advertising we see frequency caps what’s a great ad experience we’re noticing a high degree of alignment there.

“So that enthusiasm that alignment is increasing sort of my optimism and the excitement that I’ve got to basically get this out there because I think it’s going to be a win-win-win for all parties involved.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9nbG9iYWwvZ2xvYmFsL3NhdWRpLWFyYWJpYS1uZXRmbGl4LXVuLWlzbGFtaWMtY29udGVudC0xMjM1MzYyNTgxL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9nbG9iYWwvZ2xvYmFsL3NhdWRpLWFyYWJpYS1uZXRmbGl4LXVuLWlzbGFtaWMtY29udGVudC0xMjM1MzYyNTgxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi Arabia Gulf Countries Order Netflix to Remove Un-Islamic Content,"Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries in the Middle East have told global streaming giant Netflix to remove un-Islamic content. Although not specified this is understood to mean that it should take down content including LGBTQ elements.



The announcement was made Tuesday by the Committee of the Electronic Media Officials within the Gulf Cooperation Council a trade and political association that includes Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Kuwait Oman and Qatar. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. issued similar separate statements.



Associated Press reported that Saudi state television also aired video of an interview it conducted with a woman it identified as a behavioral consultant who described Netflix as being an “official sponsor of homosexuality.” It aired footage of a cartoon that had two women embrace though the footage was blurred out. “Saudi state television also aired a segment suggesting Netflix could be banned in the kingdom over that programming reaching children” AP reported.

Variety has reached out to Netflix for comment.

Saudi Arabia began moves only as recently as 2017 to establish a cinema industry something that has led to the building of multiplexes development of local companies and organization of the annual Red Sea Film Festival.



However the country which is predominantly Sunni Muslim has of late clashed with the western entertainment sector. In June the kingdom was one of more than a dozen countries where Pixar animation “Lightyear” could not be screened due to the film’s depiction of a same sex kiss. In April Marvel’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” was banned due to its inclusion of a gay character.



Saudi Arabia has no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity. But all sexual relations outside marriage are strictly prohibited. The country also operates Sharia or Islamic law. Under this system consensual same-sex sexual conduct is punishable by death or flogging.

In a joint statement issued the GCC committee and Saudi Arabia’s General Commission For Audiovisual Media demanded Netflix remove infringing contents and warned that they would take all legal measures against Netflix if it failed to adhere to the regulations.



“The committee and GCAM have confirmed that they have contacted the streaming platform to remove infringing content. In addition they have also demanded to remove contents that are directed to children as these contain infringing materials” said the Saudi Gazette.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ3VsZi1zdGF0ZXMtZGVtYW5kLW5ldGZsaXgtcHVsbC1jb250ZW50LWRlZW1lZC1vZmZlbnNpdmUtMjAyMi0wOS0wNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gulf states demand Netflix pull content deemed offensive,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/technology/gulf-states-demand-netflix-pull-content-deemed-offensive-2022-09-06/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ3VsZi1zdGF0ZXMtZGVtYW5kLW5ldGZsaXgtcHVsbC1jb250ZW50LWRlZW1lZC1vZmZlbnNpdmUtMjAyMi0wOS0wNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

LDO is focused on the underground mining and tunnelling industries specialising in systems processes mine planning and training. It has been the exclusive distributor of Canada-made Rokion battery-powered vehicles in Australasia since 2018 having deployed vehicles across the soft- and hard-rock space.

The latest Rokion deployment LDO Group is celebrating is at Agnico Eagle Mines’ Fosterville gold operation in Victoria where a Rokion R400 was recently shown off alongside a Sandvik LH518B at a launch ceremony at the gold operation.

Alan Ross General Manager of LDO Group said the R400 vehicle – a platform able to accommodate three passengers in a utility vehicle setup or up to 12 in a passenger crew variant – has been deployed as part of a six-month trial at the operation.

“They (the Fosterville team) plan to use this in a people carrier configuration” Ross told IM. “It will transport people to and from the operation.”

Considering the ramp-supported Fosterville operation goes below 800-m depth this will present a good test for the R400’s re-generation capacity and uphill performance.

Rokion says the vehicle which has 100 kWh of battery capacity was engineered for the demands of underground mining and is its most adaptive platform design capable of transporting a large crew in mine applications. Like all Rokion vehicles it incorporates lithium iron phosphate battery chemistry which the company says is the safest battery chemistry currently available.

The vehicle heading underground at Fosterville was previously deployed at a coal mining operation in Queensland yet Ross says LDO Group is now re-focusing its efforts on the hard-rock mining space.

This has already seen the company partner with Newmont on an R400 deployment at its Tanami underground operation in the Northern Territory of Australia where it was initially used to transport team members up and down the mine.

Newmont said last year that early indicators had shown the vehicle had the capability to complete several trips to and from the bottom of the Tanami mine without requiring recharging.

Ross agreed with the Newmont assessment explaining that the company was expected to re-deploy the same unit to the Tanami operation with an additional battery cooling module later this year.

“The ambient temperatures can reach 50°C in the Tanami desert so we have equipped the vehicle with this new module to cope with such extremes” he explained.

The company also has two R200 units – which include a four-passenger crew truck and a two-passenger utility truck – in Australia awaiting redeployment. One of these vehicles recently completed a successful stint at a tunnelling operation in the country.

LDO is also engaged with another mining company with an operation in New South Wales seeking to trial Rokion’s smallest battery-electric platform the R100.

The R100 series includes a four-passenger crew truck and a two-passenger utility truck with both models built on the same frame dimensions and available in ramp-ready configurations.

“We’re currently focused on these three key customers and supporting them in terms of the deployments and on-going operations” Ross said.

In addition to regular site visits from LDO personnel to support maintenance and operations staff at the underground mines LDO staff are able to remotely download data logs for these machines on a daily basis assessing if there is potential for optimising the operation or if maintenance work may need to be conducted.

With many companies in the battery-electric light vehicle conversion space in Australia struggling to get hold of donor diesel vehicles Ross says mining companies are increasingly appreciating Rokion’s ground-up approach.

“We have a fantastic OEM partner to rely on for these vehicles and we at LDO are able to support them in the best possible way” he said. “We don’t have to rely on a different vendor to obtain the base machine; the design engineering manufacturing and testing are all performed under the Rokion roof ensuring quality from concept to delivery.”

Ross said Rokion is continually working on design improvements and new machines based on industry feedback with a newly-designed R200 vehicle set to bridge the gap between the existing R200 and the larger R400.

Kipp Sakundiak CEO of Rokion was happy to provide more details of this to IM: “The latest in our R200 Series is an 11-passenger crew truck built on a heavier frame and suspension construction than our previous models all the while maintaining the simplicity and performance of dual drive motors.”

Sakundiak said the new model was robust and powerful at the same time offering a comfortable ride for all crew members.

He added: “There is a lot of adaptability built into the new platform including configurations for soft- and hard-rock applications. It’s one of our most versatile designs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL3Bpa2VzcGVha2NvdXJpZXIvd29vZGxhbmQtcGFyay1ib3lzLXNvY2Nlci1jaGFsa3MtdXAtbG9zc2VzLXRvLXNhbmQtY3JlZWstZmFsY29uL2FydGljbGVfMmYyYWM0MzItMmIwZS0xMWVkLWIzYjMtNTM4NWQ3OWYxZjBiLmh0bWzSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly9nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9waWtlc3BlYWtjb3VyaWVyL3dvb2RsYW5kLXBhcmstYm95cy1zb2NjZXItY2hhbGtzLXVwLWxvc3Nlcy10by1zYW5kLWNyZWVrLWZhbGNvbi9hcnRpY2xlXzJmMmFjNDMyLTJiMGUtMTFlZC1iM2IzLTUzODVkNzlmMWYwYi5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodland Park boys soccer chalks up losses to Sand Creek Falcon,"You have permission to edit this article.

The Herald Sun ran Price’s column over a full page on Saturday allowing him to bemoan the inclusion of “coloured or Asian people” in television advertising among other things.

Price framed himself as among a minority of white men who could no longer voice their opinion.

Data from Media Diversity Australia contradicts Price’s suggestion that white people are in the minority and that their views are being silenced.

Its 2020 research report titled Who Gets To Tell Australian Stories found more than 75% of TV reporters and presenters come from Anglo-Celtic background. The proportion was higher for commercial networks.

About 70% of television journalists rated diversity in their industry as poor or very poor and one in eight respondents from a culturally and linguistically diverse background said their background had been a “barrier to career progression”.

Media Diversity Australia chief executive Mariam Veiszadeh said the data showed Price’s claim “doesn’t hold much water when it comes to news and current affairs media representation”.

“As the saying goes equality feels like oppression for those who are accustomed to privilege” she said.

“When diversity equity and inclusion is not done well it can feel tokenistic and many can feel excluded as they are forced to come to terms with the privilege they have been unconsciously swimming in for much of their existence – at its core however these initiatives are about representation.

“We need our institutions to look and sound like Australia which the latest census shows is more diverse than ever.

“Steve’s claims therefore fly in the face of evidence and the fact that he has radio print and television platforms to vent about his so-called cancellation speaks to the core of the issue.”

The Australian Press Council confirmed it had “received complaints about this column”.

“The APC’s policy is to not publicly disclose the numbers or names of complainants about specific articles in order to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the Council’s complaints process” a spokesperson said. “Complaints received by the Press Council about material published by its publisher members are considered on a case by case basis to determine whether they comply with the Press Council’s Standards of Practice.”

News Corp did not respond to a request for comment.

Price has ample opportunity to share his views. He has a regular column in one of the nation’s most widely read tabloids and is a host of Channel Ten’s The Project. He is also host of a program titled Australia Today aired on LiSTNR and Triple M regionals.

The column prompted widespread criticism on social media. Victorian MP Martin Pakula tweeted: “When I’m old I want a regular spot on The Project and a full page spread in Melbourne’s highest selling daily newspaper to whinge about how I’ve been cancelled.”

The Herald Sun ran Price’s column over a full page on Saturday allowing him to bemoan the inclusion of “coloured or Asian people” in television advertising among other things.

Price framed himself as among a minority of white men who could no longer voice their opinion.

Data from Media Diversity Australia contradicts Price’s suggestion that white people are in the minority and that their views are being silenced.

Its 2020 research report titled Who Gets To Tell Australian Stories found more than 75% of TV reporters and presenters come from Anglo-Celtic background. The proportion was higher for commercial networks.

About 70% of television journalists rated diversity in their industry as poor or very poor and one in eight respondents from a culturally and linguistically diverse background said their background had been a “barrier to career progression”.

Media Diversity Australia chief executive Mariam Veiszadeh said the data showed Price’s claim “doesn’t hold much water when it comes to news and current affairs media representation”.

“As the saying goes equality feels like oppression for those who are accustomed to privilege” she said.

“When diversity equity and inclusion is not done well it can feel tokenistic and many can feel excluded as they are forced to come to terms with the privilege they have been unconsciously swimming in for much of their existence – at its core however these initiatives are about representation.

“We need our institutions to look and sound like Australia which the latest census shows is more diverse than ever.

“Steve’s claims therefore fly in the face of evidence and the fact that he has radio print and television platforms to vent about his so-called cancellation speaks to the core of the issue.”

The Australian Press Council confirmed it had “received complaints about this column”.

“The APC’s policy is to not publicly disclose the numbers or names of complainants about specific articles in order to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the Council’s complaints process” a spokesperson said. “Complaints received by the Press Council about material published by its publisher members are considered on a case by case basis to determine whether they comply with the Press Council’s Standards of Practice.”

News Corp did not respond to a request for comment.

Price has ample opportunity to share his views. He has a regular column in one of the nation’s most widely read tabloids and is a host of Channel Ten’s The Project. He is also host of a program titled Australia Today aired on LiSTNR and Triple M regionals.

The column prompted widespread criticism on social media. Victorian MP Martin Pakula tweeted: “When I’m old I want a regular spot on The Project and a full page spread in Melbourne’s highest selling daily newspaper to whinge about how I’ve been cancelled.”

Price responded: “Need to read the words Marty never said anything about being cancelled mate.”

The headline of the column was “I’m old male and cancelled”. When this was pointed out to Price he responded that he did not write the headlines.

(WIBW) - The country’s largest wind and solar operator is looking to Jackson County for a possible project but residents at the county’s commission meeting this afternoon said they are not interested.

“Why on Earth would you choose here in Kansas USA. About a third of the days are sunny.”

“How do you know technology isn’t going to make this thing obsolete in 10?”

“I’m supposed to have property rights in Kansas and a Florida company is going to take that away from me?”

A crowd of concerned residents attended the Jackson County Commission’s meet and greet Tuesday afternoon with energy operator NextEra Energy. NextEra hopes to gauge interest are in the possible construction of a new solar farm in the area. They’re looking for about 2000 acres of land between 110th and 158th west of E Road.

Those in attendance had plenty of questions about possible noise and hazards property rights and where the energy would go. NextEra assured the crowd the energy would remain in the Southwest Power Pool which extends from northern Texas to North Dakota.

“We put it on the grid and when we get to the point of having a project proposal we’ll have a customer identified and power purchase agreement. It could be outside of Kansas.”

The company also promised that any project wouldn’t involve hazardous materials customers would be contracted to continue buying energy for the life of the project and NextEra would perform any studies requested by the county. Regardless the county’s residents say they didn’t sign up for this kind of project.

“You moved into an area with an understanding of the zoning and it’s kind of the whole purpose of zoning” one resident said. “I bought that hundred acres because I understand the guy next to me is going to be farming he’s not going to be setting up an Amazon distribution center. Because if I had known that I wouldn’t have bought that hundred acres.”

“We moved out into agricultural for a reason” said another. “We didn’t want this garbage. I did not move into a city next to an industrial zone.”

Commissioners and NextEra’s reps emphasized the process is nowhere close to any kind of approval or agreement. Some residents say they’ll make sure it stays that way.

“If it goes through there’s enough people in there that were mad enough that we will get a class-action suit against any leaser that has solar panels put on their property” Tom Hoffman said. “Because they don’t want to live on a solar wasteland.”

Any project would take upwards of five years to get off the ground. The resulting solar farm would be expected to run at least 30 years.

The 145-mile line which would carry hydropower from Canada into New England received a major lift last week after Maine’s highest court ruled that a 2021 ballot referendum blocking the project was unconstitutional. The decision marks the latest twist in a four-year saga over the project which is a cornerstone of Massachusetts’ efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Yet the future of the so-called New England Clean Energy Connect line remains uncertain.

The Maine high court returned the case to a lower court. The project’s developer Avangrid Inc. will need to prove it began construction last year with its state permit which was issued before Maine residents voted to block the project. Appeals of the project’s federal permits are also pending and there is an open case concerning whether the line can cross state-owned land.

“It’s definitely a significant win because the alternative could have been far worse. But it doesn’t clear the way; there are a bunch of hurdles they are going to have to jump over” said Timothy Fox an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. “If I were the project developer I would be hopeful but I wouldn’t be popping Champagne corks yet.”

The legal drama in Maine comes as the national spotlight is focused on the challenges of completing large-scale infrastructure projects. Congress is preparing to debate permitting reform this fall and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is contemplating an overhaul of its rules governing transmission planning.

Experts say new transmission is needed not only to connect clean energy projects to the grid but to ship electricity back and forth across regions to accommodate fluctuations in renewable output. When the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine mapped out a pathway to net-zero emissions by midcentury last year it estimated the U.S. needs a 60 percent increase in transmission capacity by 2030 to connect and distribute future clean energy resources like wind and solar.

But building transmission lines can be a fraught undertaking. U.S. transmission development fell to less than 400 miles last year down from 1400 miles the year prior according to the American Clean Power Association a trade group representing clean energy developers.

The experience in Maine shows why transmission development can be so difficult.

The project is an outgrowth of a 2016 Massachusetts law that directed Bay State utilities to procure Canadian hydropower to complement a build-out of offshore wind. Under a subsequent deal with Massachusetts’ power companies Hydro-Québec would deliver 9.45 terawatt-hours of electricity annually enough to satisfy 18 percent of Massachusetts’ power demand.

Avangrid estimates the project would slash carbon dioxide emissions by 3.1 million tons annually. By comparison New England’s total power plant emissions last year were 25 million tons.

But Massachusetts needs a transmission line to deliver the electricity. An initial plan to run a power line through New Hampshire was dropped after resistance from residents there. That led to the selection of New England Clean Energy Connect.

The nearly $1 billion project would cut a 53-mile path through the Maine woods starting at the Canadian border and working its way west before reaching an existing transmission corridor that runs south to the city of Lewiston Maine where the line would be plugged into the New England grid.

The project has met overwhelming opposition in Maine where nearly 60 percent of residents supported a ballot measure to block the project last year. Some voters expressed concern about fragmenting the Maine woods. The project was also opposed by competing power companies which spent millions backing the ballot measure to block it. NextEra Energy Inc. the operator of the Seabrook Nuclear Station in New Hampshire has been particularly fierce in fighting the line pumping $20 million into the ballot referendum and challenging the project through state and federal regulatory agencies (Climatewire Jan. 18).

Opponents say their resistance to the line goes beyond simple NIMBYism. Tom Saviello a former Republican state senator who has led opposition to the project argues that western Maine would carry the costs of hosting the project without receiving sufficient economic benefits.

In 2019 Gov. Janet Mills (D) negotiated a $258 million settlement meant to ease public opposition to the project (Climatewire Feb. 25 2019). The deal provided funding for electric cars and heat pumps but did little to address the primary economic concerns in western Maine like a lack of high-speed internet access Saviello said.

Avangrid “were getting the gold mine. We were getting a whoopie pie” he said. “We are giving up all this to change the environment in the state of Maine.”

Much of the opposition to the project stems from distrust of Central Maine Power the Avangrid subsidiary building the line said Adam Cote a lawyer representing opponents of the line. The utility has struggled with outages and billing problems in recent years. It ranked last in J.D. Power’s most recent customer satisfaction survey of utilities. Only a veto from Mills last year prevented passage of a law calling for a public takeover of the company.

Claims that the transmission line will benefit the climate sound especially hollow to some opponents who note that Central Maine Power lobbied to kill a recent rooftop solar bill Cote said.

“This really comes down to would you trust CMP would do this?” he said. “They like to take the national mantle that they are trying to do something for the environment but Mainers know different. They are doing something for profit.”

Avangrid declined to comment for this article. But in a statement after the Maine Supreme Judicial Court decision the company framed the ruling as a victory for clean energy.

“It is time to move away from the status quo fossil fuel companies who will undoubtedly continue their fight to maintain a stranglehold on the New England energy market” Avangrid said.

‘Siting transmission lines is hard’

Advocates of the project say it’s necessary to further New England’s decarbonization efforts. Hydro complements wind and solar development because it can be quickly ramped up and down to meet fluctuating renewable output they note.

It would also address concerns over the region’s reliance on natural gas which accounted for almost half of New England’s power generation in 2021. The region has long relied on liquefied natural gas imports to balance the grid during cold weather events due to New England’s limited pipeline infrastructure. A particularly cold winter would be especially expensive if the region is forced into the spot market for LNG where prices have been surging due to the war in Ukraine (Climatewire May 10).

And while Massachusetts consumers are paying for the line its benefits would be shared across ISO New England the wholesale electricity market connecting the six Northeastern states supporters say.

“We’ve got to move large amounts of renewables and zero-carbon energy to the major population centers. There is no getting around that if we’re to truly address climate change in the U.S.” said Sharon Reishus a former Maine utility regulator who supports the project. “If you believe in climate change then we have to act. Some of that will be easy and some of that will be hard. And siting transmission lines is hard.”

Fox the ClearView analyst said hydro is needed to marry New England’s decarbonization goals with the reliability of its power grid. He noted that New England Clean Energy Connect would become the third largest supplier of electricity in the region after the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants.

“All the New England states want to go green and that is great but we need dispatchable generation” he said. “Hydro is much more reliable and much less intermittent. From the grid operator’s point of view they were looking at this transmission line as an opportunity to get new supply built. It resolves the inherent conflict between green agenda and grid reliability.”

Avangrid had cut 124 miles of the project’s corridor erected multiple transmission structures and spent $450 million by the time of the vote last year according to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.

The project now faces a likely trial in a lower Maine court where it will need to prove it had vested rights prior to the November 2021 ballot measure. Maine’s high court found that a ballot measure could not retroactively limit property rights but it left open the question of whether Avangrid was in compliance with the permit issued by Maine utility regulators.

The key question going forward will be whether Avangrid sped up construction of the project to ensure its rights were vested by the time of the vote.

While the court did not decide whether Avangrid performed substantial construction in “good faith” the justices wrote “it appears from the limited record developed in connection with the request for preliminary injunctive relief that NECEC did so.”

Even if Avangrid proves its rights are vested it still needs to beat back a separate lawsuit challenging its ability to cross state land as well as appeals to its federal Clean Water Act permit and presidential permit to cross an international boundary. The sheer number of permits and appeals speaks to the difficulties of developing transmission in the U.S. today said Jeffrey Porter who leads the environmental practice at Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo PC a Boston-based law firm.

“Across the board the multiplicity of regulations required and appeals allowable guarantee the amount of time it takes to build the infrastructure we want is going to take longer than the time we have” Porter said. “Congress needs to look at how to streamline permitting and how do we limit appeals once a permit is in hand.”

Congress appears poised to have a debate over how to do that. As part of the deal to win West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D) support for a climate and spending bill earlier this summer Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed to address permitting reform this fall. Manchin has proposed setting two-year limits on environmental reviews limiting appeals and permitting the Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline.

Just as important are FERC’s efforts to update its rules governing transmission planning said Rob Gramlich president of the consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC. FERC’s proposal seeks to bolster regional transmission planning.

Future decarbonization efforts will benefit from increased regional planning he said pointing to the example of the Midwest where a multistate effort led by the regional grid operator led to the construction of 16 transmission lines over the last decade.

In the meantime clean energy advocates need to work on outreach efforts in states like Maine to educate the public on the importance of transmission to decarbonization initiatives he added.

“I don’t think the people in Maine who voted against the line really knew any of the clean energy benefits of the line” Gramlich said. “These are systemwide benefits to make the whole system work and achieve a cleaner system portfolio.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQvc3RhdGUtcG9saXRpY3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NTIxMzU0MS5odG1s0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWlhbWloZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MtZ292ZXJubWVudC9zdGF0ZS1wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlMjY1MjEzNTQxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DeSantis ’18 campaign got $25000 from nonprofit secretly funded by FPL cash records show,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.miamiherald.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Credit: Shanghai Electric / PRNewswire.

Chinese energy company Shanghai Electric has announced the completion of Phase B of the 900MW fifth phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Part of one of the world’s largest solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities the project will have the capacity to generate 2.268 billion kWh of power a year upon completion.

It will generate enough clean energy to power 240000 homes in the region while displacing 1.1 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year.

Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park Phase V project manager Meng Chuanmin said: “We are so proud to see the solar park hit another historical milestone after Phase A was connected to the grid in 2021.

“Now work on Phase C is well underway and is expected to complete in 2023.

“The construction process of the fifth phase of MBR Solar Park is marked by a series of challenges culminating in the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic that severely disrupted global supply chains.

“The team overcame the difficulties and ensured the procurement and delivery of the raw materials for the project were timely implemented to avoid any delay to the overall progress.”

The fifth phase of the park is owned by ACWA Power.

In 2020 ACWA Power selected Shanghai Electric as the project’s engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contractor.

The project comprised Phases A B and C and has a total installed capacity of 1.05GW.

Shanghai Electric said that the project has created more than 4000 direct and 10000 indirect jobs.

The company has also been involved in the construction of the solar park’s fourth phase which includes a 700MW concentrated solar power (CSP) plant and a 250MW PV plant.

The CSP can store thermal energy during the daytime so it can be used for electricity generation at night enabling a constant supply of energy.",,,

“We actually have been watching this technology in the medical and automotive space for a while now” said Carmen Zolman Nike’s vice president of innovation apparel design. “We were definitely intrigued by the method of make in terms of its simplicity and its speed.”

After more than five years of work Nike is bringing it to market and expects it to play a major role in its clothing business which generated $13.6 billion in sales in the year through May 2022. Forward is a more sustainable material with even better performance qualities than its usual materials according to the company. It has a higher warmth-to-weight ratio and a carbon footprint that’s 75 percent smaller than the brand’s comparable knit fleece Nike said.

The first products — sweatshirts in hoodie and crewneck styles — release globally on September 8 but Nike is already comparing it to Dri-Fit the sweat-wicking material Nike debuted more than 20 years ago that came to feature prominently in everything from its tops to socks.

John Donahoe Nike’s chief executive went with a slightly different analogy when teasing it on the company’s earnings call in June saying it “could do for apparel what Flyknit did for footwear.” Flyknit introduced a new footwear manufacturing process that was faster and produced less waste by letting Nike weave shoe uppers rather than having to cut panels of materials and stitch them together. That process now features in numerous Nike sneakers and has also been used for sports bras.

Forward is similar in that Nike sees it as a manufacturing innovation that will ripple through its offering and according to Zolman could even eventually make its way into footwear. The process to make it cuts out some of the most carbon-intensive steps of traditional clothing production specifically spinning raw fibres into yarn and then weaving or knitting that yarn into fabric. If Nike is able to replicate the success of either Dri-Fit or Flyknit it would provide a sizable boost to its apparel business which despite a dip in the latest quarter due to Covid lockdowns in China and supply-chain delays has remained strong in recent years by combining performance and fashion.

First however Nike may need to convince shoppers to embrace Forward’s unique look and feel. The material has an industrial quality. It’s like a thin slightly stiffened felt punched full of little holes with a more rigid drape than the usual sweatshirt materials. (Nike is using it for cold-weather products to start but Zolman said they can adjust it for other uses including warm-weather items.)

“Customers do look to Nike for innovation” said Jessica Ramirez senior research analyst at investment firm Jane Hali & Associates. “It’s something that does keep you ahead of the game — and you always want to be ahead of the game.”

How Nike Makes Forward

What makes Forward different from most activewear materials comes down to the way it’s made.

Any clothing fabric that isn’t an animal hide is generally a knit or woven. Forward is neither. It’s in the family of what are called non-wovens which include the material used for surgical masks. To create it Nike feeds a web of fibres — mostly recycled and virgin polyester — through a machine containing a bed of thousands of tiny needles that punch through and attach them together.

The result is a layered fabric Nike says it can adjust to its specifications changing the weight or texture based on its needs. The ribbing at the sleeves and hem on Nike’s first Forward products for example are made by the same process as the body.

“We’re effectively going from fiber to fabric and it allows us to tune that performance to whatever our athlete needs” Zolman said. “It’s a hoodie today but it’s going to be so much more tomorrow.”

Nike believes consumers will buy it because the benefits are worthwhile. It doesn’t compromise on athletic performance and satisfies shoppers’ demands for products that are less damaging to the climate. The company said its calculation of Forward’s carbon footprint is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment by PRe Sustainability B.V. a Netherlands-based consultancy.

Usually fabric is dyed and finished too which can involve large volumes of water and toxic chemicals. Nike isn’t dyeing the material for the first launch so it didn’t use any water. The grey colour is the result of Nike using black and white fibres to make the fabric.

The manufacturing process also enables Nike to use a variety of recycled materials including industrial and post-consumer waste. The products in the first release will contain more than 70 percent recycled content and won’t have zippers or extra trims making them easier to recycle themselves.

Because it uses so much polyester Forward can’t dodge one of activewear’s biggest problems: the shedding of microfibres that are polluting oceans and even the air. Zolman however said their tests found it sheds less than knit fabrics.

The Big Challenge of Scaling

If Nike really wants to use Forward to cut its carbon footprint it will need to scale the technology. That’s not so simple.

Nike’s engineers had to modify existing machines to develop Forward much like Nike did when it created Flyknit. It’s not a simple off-the-shelf solution. But Zolman noted the company has been working with its global manufacturing partners to get the technology ready to scale.

Of course just adding more clothes even if they have a smaller carbon footprint on top of its existing business won’t actually reduce Nike’s total impact. The company would also have to start selling more Forward items in place of what it offers now.

“Is it a good-looking product? Does it feel nice? Does it serve a purpose? If so I don’t think the customer needs a full education” Ramirez said. That Nike’s name is on it will probably make them more willing to give it a try she added.

“As our biggest innovation platform since Dri-Fit we do have big plans for it” Zolman said. “We believe it’s our responsibility as a very large apparel manufacturer to not only innovate these new ways of doing things sustainably but to bring them to scale.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzkvbmlrZS1mb3J3YXJkLWFwcGFyZWwtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWluZm_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Forward Apparel Collection Release Date,"Nike‘s design teams are constantly fishing for ways to engineer products that help athletes perform better feel more comfortable and look flier all the while being more friendly to our Mother Earth. Technologies like DRI-Fit and Tech Fleece and FlyKnit have all been key categories for the brand’s apparel line and now it’s adding its latest piece of innovative apparel to its cannon — Nike Forward.

The new range is designed with a reductive approach. Instead of abiding by the traditional multi-stage production cycle the Swoosh has altered its tactics by instead turning fiber to textile through a needle-punch and as a result has lowered its carbon footprint by 75%. The pieces — which include sporty gray pullover hoodies and crewnecks for men and women — also come manufactured with 70% recycled content by weight and this further aligns with the sportswear giant’s commitment to sustainability. “As part of our commitment to serve the athletes* by offering more sustainable options and meeting our bold science-based impact targets we’re introducing a material innovation that can be adapted to different lifestyle and performance purposes.” Says Snikeana Hannah VP Sustainable Innovation Nike Inc.

Nike Forward items can be made with various layers such as industrial and post-consumer waste. It doubles up as a new category for Nike to solve athlete’s problems and create a new bar for sportswear aesthetic and performance.

Those interested in copping can find the Nike Forward hoodie and crew styles releasing globally on September 15 2022.

The Chemung County Sheriff's Office said Raymond W. Johns III was struck around 3:08 a.m. Saturday near Front Street by a Norfolk Southern train. Police responded to the area following a report by the train conductor and located the body about 200 yards east of the Crossover.

The sheriff's department published a report on social media Sunday with a description of Johns and family members and a local tattoo artist responded and identified him.

Police said Johns was last seen by family members about a week ago wearing some of the items described in the Facebook post.

An autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death.

The sheriff's office was assisted by the Wellsburg Volunteer Fire Department Erway Ambulance and the Chemung County Medical Examiners Office.

Railway Age Capitol Hill Contributing Editor Frank N. Wilner weighs in.

STB determined that those railroads achieved a rate of return on net investment (ROI) equal to or greater than the agency’s calculation of the average cost of capital for the freight rail industry which for 2021 is 10.37%. STB last month reported the annual cost of capital which represents the STB Office of Economics’ estimate of the average rate of return needed to persuade investors to provide capital to the industry.

By comparing STB’s cost of capital figure to the 2021 ROIs—calculated from data reported in the carriers’ Annual Report R-1 Schedule 250 filings—a revenue adequacy figure has been determined for each of the Class I’s in operation as of December 31 2021.

Here are the 2021 Class I ROIs (railroads in bold are revenue adequate):

BNSF: 13.19%

CSX: 15.51%

Grand Trunk Corp. (the U.S. affiliate of CN): 7.79%

Kansas City Southern: 8.25%

Norfolk Southern: 13.18%

Soo Line (the U.S. affiliate of Canadian Pacific): 13.51%

Union Pacific: 17.03%

Frank N. Wilner

“For shippers the [STB] decision is largely hollow” observes Wilner who was formerly Assistant Vice President for Policy at the Association of American Railroads and a White House-appointed (Bill Clinton) chief of staff at the STB and is the author of seven books including the soon to be published Railroads & Economic Regulation. “This is because while the 1980 Staggers Rail Act instructed regulators to consider revenue adequacy in determining rate reasonableness and STB predecessor Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1985 (Coal Rate Guidelines) established a Revenue Adequacy Constraint neither the ICC nor STB has followed through.

“That still festering 1985 ICC rulemaking provided that a revenue adequate railroad would be constrained from taking further rate increases unless it could demonstrate ‘with particularity’ its need for higher revenue the harm it would suffer if it could not collect higher revenue and why a shipper should pay higher rates.

“While most Class I railroads have been revenue adequate—or on the cusp—every year since 2008 the STB remains hung-up on three questions: 1) For how many years should a railroad be found to be revenue adequate before the constraint is applied? 2) Will imposing the constraint inhibit or prevent railroads that are not revenue inadequate from achieving revenue adequacy? 3) Are there situations—an economic downturn for example—when the constraint should not be imposed or if in-place be lifted?

“In 2019 an STB internal Rate Reform Task Force (RRTF) warned that a railroad could be found revenue adequate in any single year but still not be long-term revenue adequate; or conversely be found revenue inadequate in any single year even though it is long-term revenue adequate. The RRTF recommended the agency define the shortest period that constitutes long-term revenue adequacy—but not shorter than five years and include both a year in which a recession began and a year following—and identify a point beyond which demand-based differential pricing is unwarranted.

“Given the continued non-action of the Board shippers could well borrow a lament from the musical Cabaret: ‘For the sun will rise and the moon will set; and learn how to settle for what you get. So who cares so what? So who cares so what?’”

Railway Age provides the revenue adequacy results for 2020 2019 and 2018 below.

STB found that five Class I’s were also revenue adequate for 2020. They were BNSF CSX Kansas City Southern Soo Line and Union Pacific. STB’s 2020 railroad cost of capital was 7.89%. Following are the 2020 Class I ROIs (railroads in bold were revenue adequate):

BNSF: 11.60%

CSX: 11.35%

Grand Trunk Corp. (the U.S. affiliate of CN): 7.20%

Kansas City Southern: 8.06%

Norfolk Southern: 7.52%

Soo Line (the U.S. affiliate of Canadian Pacific): 10.68%

Union Pacific: 14.44%

For 2019 the five Class I’s found to be revenue adequate were BNSF CSX Norfolk Southern Soo Line and Union Pacific; the cost of capital for the year was 9.34%. Below are the 2019 Class I ROIs (railroads in bold were revenue adequate):

BNSF: 12.04%

CSX: 12.84%

Grand Trunk Corp. (the U.S. affiliate of CN): 7.47%

Kansas City Southern: 6.20%

Norfolk Southern: 11.59%

Soo Line (the U.S. affiliate of Canadian Pacific): 11.34%

Union Pacific: 15.55%

In contrast STB determined that three Class I’s—CSX Soo Line and UP—were revenue adequate for 2018; the cost of capital for the year was 12.22%. Following are the 2018 Class I ROIs (railroads in bold were revenue adequate):

BNSF: 11.89%

CSX: 13.18%

Grand Trunk Corp. (the U.S. affiliate of CN): 7.69%

Kansas City Southern: 8.03%

Norfolk Southern: 11.63%

Soo Line (the U.S. affiliate of Canadian Pacific): 13.49%

Union Pacific: 15.80%

That signals a potential property turnaround at the heart of the biggest metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States.

Construction on three major mixed-use developments — Centennial Yards South Downtown and Underground Atlanta — are underway or in advanced planning stages within a quarter-mile radius in the core of Atlanta's downtown. All three with office and residential components are located on sites that have been vacant or underused for years.

Developers and their equity partners are hopeful based on the success of similar big-city downtown developments from New York to Los Angeles.

""Now is the time for downtown"" Shaneel Lalani CEO of Underground Atlanta developer Lalani Ventures told CoStar News. ""This is ultimately going to be the perfect place to be.""

That may be a safer bet for multifamily than for office property. Downtown Atlanta did not have any construction of top-tier new office buildings between the Great Recession and the pandemic according to CoStar research. The office tower at 55 Allen Plaza developed by Barry Real Estate Cos. is the only Class A office property completed downtown since 2007 for lack of demand — even before the pandemic spurred working from home.

That's not stopping Los Angeles property investor CIM Group German investor Newport RE and a suburban Atlanta businessman with little experience in real estate development from going all-in on downtown. These developers are looking to emulate the success of projects like L.A. Live in Los Angeles and Hudson Yards in New York City which they weren't involved with.

In downtown Atlanta the developers also have a hard-and-fast deadline to get something done: soccer’s 2026 FIFA World Cup.

FIFA's choice of Atlanta as one of 16 North American cities to host World Cup matches illuminates the downtown district's massive potential. With the 75000-seat Mercedes-Benz Stadium where the World Cup matches will be played along with State Farm Arena and the Georgia World Congress Center downtown is a magnet for tourists and conventions — if not new offices and residences.

Atlanta’s downtown business district has steadily declined for decades as highly desirable office tenants like banks and law firms in the 1970s bolted to Atlanta's most desirable districts such as Buckhead and later Midtown. Retailers fled too including the 1991 closing of the historic Rich's department store.

Rents for downtown offices trail those in Midtown and Buckhead according to CoStar research. The average rate for downtown in the second quarter was $30.60 per square foot compared to $40.92 for Midtown and $36.36 for Upper Buckhead.

Meanwhile downtown failed to secure any of Atlanta's top 10 largest new office leases and renewals in the second quarter which include staffing firm Insight Global's 134000-square-foot lease in the Central Perimeter district according to Savills.

Multifamily development in downtown Atlanta has been ramping up as the district's inventory has almost doubled since 2010 according to CoStar research. But downtown has lagged behind the rest of Atlanta in costs to rent an apartment. The average apartment rent in downtown Atlanta is 41% higher than a decade ago but that's far behind the 72% increase in average rent for the entire Atlanta area according to CoStar research.

Even downtown's prime economic driver — its convention business — has struggled in the wake of the pandemic. While the average downtown hotel occupancy rose to 56% in May this year compared to 39% in May 2021 according to the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau STR data shows that it's still lower than the 65% for the United States and the almost 81% for all of New York City.

Longtime Struggles

Ambitious plans for downtown development have been mentioned for years but developers have struggled to pull them off. Underground Atlanta especially has had more than its fair share of false starts.

The unusual retail and restaurant district located beneath city viaducts and next to an active freight railroad line opened in 1969 and initially was successful. But its popularity waned in the late 1970s and it shut down in 1980.

Underground’s reopening at the time of the 1996 Olympics was short-lived and the district has been largely vacant for the past 20 years. A South Carolina-based developer acquired it in 2017 but never followed through with redevelopment plans.

Now Lalani a businessman from suburban Gwinnett County wants to take a shot at Underground. Lalani acquired the property in 2020 for $31 million and recently signed Underground’s first significant new tenant in years craft brewery Atlanta Brewing.

Lalani told CoStar News that he envisions Underground as a live-work-play district with the initial emphasis on multifamily properties.

“Once we have people living downtown everything else will follow” he said.

Lalani is working with Niles Bolton Associates on creating a master plan which he said could be released by year’s end. He has not yet hired an architect or general contractor and he hasn’t disclosed an estimated project value.

Centennial Yards

The $5 billion Centennial Yards is much larger in both size and scope. CIM Group wants to build office towers and residential buildings an entertainment district and a hotel on a platform covering a wide expanse of parking lots rail lines and a smattering of old trees.

Legal battles over Centennial Yards’ public financing stalled the project for years. But the first property the conversion of a 1912 Norfolk Southern building into apartments opened last year.

Now Centennial Yards is set to kick into high gear as construction will begin before the end of 2022 on three apartment buildings and a hotel Brian McGowan president of Centennial Yards told CoStar News.

CIM Group is negotiating with potential tenants for its office space. All new buildings will be set on a grid of new city streets planned specifically for Centennial Yards.

McGowan echoed Lalani’s thoughts that the residential aspect is the most important.

“What downtown lacks right now is residential” McGowan said. “We can build a ton of apartments because that’s what our downtown needs. It needs more people living there.”

German real estate investor Newport RE is restoring several historic buildings in downtown Atlanta as part of an attempt to revive the neighborhood including the midcentury-modern 222 Mitchell St. (Newport)

The $500 million South Downtown project also has an ambitious goal to revive an entire neighborhood within downtown using nothing but the historic building stock. One of the first projects for South Downtown is the restoration of 222 Mitchell St. a massive midcentury-modern structure that once served as a bank processing center.

The former C&S Bank facility accumulated decades of grime while it was vacant and Newport has been pressure-washing the exterior in recent weeks said Brooke Dewey managing director at JLL who is handling the office leasing. Next Newport plans to restore the interior for creative office space.

Across the street Newport is also restoring Hotel Row a collection of 1920s structures that once housed hotels like The Sylvan. In total Newport acquired four dozen historic buildings totaling 800000 square feet and a handful of surface parking lots.

Transit

Whether all these downtown projects are successful will depend at least in part on improving transportation connections.

Downtown Atlanta is somewhat difficult to access by car so it’s essential that the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority’s Five Points station the city’s busiest subway station be modernized and improved McGowan said.

“You’ve got to make it easier for people on the outskirts of the city to get here” he said.

MARTA is planning a $200 million restoration to improve passenger access to trains and buses and to remove a bulky concrete canopy that covers the structure. The agency recently received a $25 million grant for the planned upgrades to the Five Points station which opened in 1979.

The station's renovation is expected to help the new downtown developments and make it easier for the thousands of workers and students who commute downtown during the week.

Federal and state government agencies occupy huge amounts of office space downtown including the Georgia Capitol courthouses and the 1.5 million-square-foot Sam Nunn Federal Center.

The 53000-student Georgia State University has expanded downtown both through acquisitions and construction of new buildings feeding thousands of students to live in its downtown dorms.

The three major developments could exponentially increase the number of permanent residents and workers downtown Gene Kansas a longtime Atlanta commercial real estate broker told CoStar News. Visitors may not be able to see it now as work is in the early stages for all three projects but the time feels right for downtown to finally rebound he said.

“It’s hard even for commercial real estate professionals to see something that doesn’t exist yet” Kansas said. “But I think this is going to happen now.”

Broader economic conditions have left many investors and potential buyers out in the cold with inflation hitting a four-decade high and interest rates aggressively climbing.

Q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more

As part of its arsenal the Federal Reserve has been actively raising its prime interest rates the latest of which was 0.75% at the end of July as it looks to take the benchmark rate between 2.25% - 2.5%.

The cost of owning a home has also become out of reach even for the most financially sound buyers and investors. Since January mortgage rates have already climbed by more than two percentage points jumping from 3.22% to 5.81% by June.

The high level of uncertainty has left many buyers and investors to put their search for a potential property on hold for now at least.

Albeit the negative macroeconomic conditions it’s starting to look as if the market has slightly cooled in recent months.

The high cost of borrowing has brought down applications to their lowest in more than two decades. Moreover existing home sales have also somewhat subsided trending below 2019 levels.

The changing economic cycle has left buyers and investors looking for alternative ways in which they can recession-proof their investments and mitigate the possibility of experiencing a major loss in the event of a sudden economic turndown.

For some potential buyers and investors the possibility of owning some form of real estate is now lying in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) especially as the market is sailing through choppy conditions.

Moreover a handful of buyers and investors are also considering the possibility of international REITs as a stronger dollar has allowed them the upper hand in the foreign real estate investment market.

Though there’s a mixed consensus regarding REITs the outlook is perhaps stronger and more fruitful than placing their investments in the bearish stock market.

The burgeoning pressure has managed to push down on even the most seasoned buyers and investors. Costly borrowing skyrocketing inflation and a high level of uncertainty are forcing many in a completely alternative direction.

Slowing economic conditions at least in the U.S. are making international real estate investments increasingly attractive this is perhaps a foreign concept that not many have considered though the opportunities are available especially for international REITs.

Depending on who you may ask the U.S real estate market is starting to show signs of cooling but the higher rates have left many first-time buyers hawkish. In some parts of the country residential real estate has slowed while commercial real estate has shot up in some states.

In America some states with high-end zip codes may soon see a softening in the market to attract potential buyers but this would require buyers and investors to be patient before making a drastic decision.

In a recent move regional housing markets have been slashing home prices with some listings taking a 34% cut in July well above the 25.7% in May according to data by Redfin.

Lucrative neighborhoods in major metropolitan cities from San Francisco on the west coast to areas such as Camden Newark and New York in the northeast have been cutting back on housing prices to attract investors as they navigate a housing recession.

Local and foreign buyers have now seen entering the market at various stages to take advantage of the current conditions.

In terms of localized efforts to boost the state economy different states have been making adjustments to draw in more investment not just for the retail sector but for innovation as well.

Among economic indicators some states are trailing include uplifting the quality of life through building better state-funded programs and helping citizens with much-needed tax breaks amid soaring inflation.

Tourism has also seen a major influx of economic activity throughout the summer months for many popular states with major connecting airports. In New Jersey flights from Jersey to Europe and inbound connections saw the Newark Liberty International Airport passenger count jump by 53% in June 2022.

Other airports including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Fort Worth International Airport Denver International Airport Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport made up the top 5 busiest airports in the world as both domestic and international leisure travel was up from pre-pandemic figures.

The case here shows that economic activity has been going up in some sectors but when it comes to local real estate some states are lagging far behind their counterparts.

Despite current conditions many Americans are feeling a bit more positive about looking to Europe and abroad to purchase real estate as the stronger dollar-euro exchange rate helps them snap into affordable housing.

Even if you don’t feel like going through all the trouble of moving abroad or having to deal with foreign real estate laws you can always look to invest your cash in some lucrative foreign REITs that still invest a majority stake outside of the American real estate market.

5 International REITs worth considering

While a majority of real estate investment trusts frequently invest in American properties these REIT options are oftentimes used as a point of entry for foreign and international real estate as well.

Just as with the domestic market there is still a lot that buyers and investors need to consider when choosing a REIT option.

For starters international REITs typically concentrate on countries that already have a thriving real estate market. Then there’s the current economic and political climate that plays a major role in the performance of international REITs regardless of where in the world they may be buying up properties.

For better portfolio growth and stability here are our five picks for international REITs buyers and investors should consider in the near term.

iShares International Developed Real Estate ETF

iShares (NASDAQ:IFGL) has been a popular and affordable purchase REIT option for many as month over month performance has been steady jumping by 2.86% between July and August.

While year-to-date (YTD) performance has been down 17.91% this investment tracks investment results of the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index.

The majority of the investment is made up of real estate equities that are developed in non-American markets.

Unlike other well-known REITs iShares measures underlying stock markets in developed countries and typically engage with companies that own and develop real estate in foreign markets.

Second to Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA: SCHH) iShares has one of the lowest expense ratios currently at 0.08% whereas SCHH sits at 0.07%

WisdomTree Global Ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF

WisdomTree (NYSEARCA:DRW) has undergone major changes in recent months. In the past the fund focussed on tracking dividend-centered indices of international real estate companies.

Now since April 2022 the fund is focussing on companies that derive revenue from tech real estate operations.

The makeover means that DRW works with megatrends that are globally recognized including cloud computing internet connectivity such as 4G and 5G logistics and life sciences.

Considering its change of direction the fund is even now more attractive than before in terms of foreign real estate investment. DRW currently yields at 5.83% while YTD performance has come down 5.87% the fund is considered a remarkable purchase for long-term investors who are willing to hold for five years or longer after which return on investment starts to substantially increase.n

Vanguard Global ex-US Real Est ETF

While Vanguard (NASDAQ:VNQI) takes a completely different approach seasoned investors find more comfortable investing in a company that tracks the performance of the S&P Global ex-U.S. Property Index.

Somewhat traditional than what you’d expect from American REIT funds Vanguard allows for more transparent and reliable access to the international REIT market.

The fund follows a float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted adjusted index making it easier to track and measure the basic equity market performance of international real estate stocks.

Moreover instead of only measuring indexes in developed economies Vanguard follows trends in emerging markets for both REITs and specific real estate management and development companies (REMDs).

The other positive news about VNQI is that it holds around 99.17% foreign holdings and has return equity of 8.3%. Throughout the first couple of years performance is slower and the initial return will most likely start after three to five years depending on the macroeconomic conditions.

Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF

Focused on tracking and measuring Select Real Estate Securities the Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:RWX) is a float-adjusted market capitalization index performance in conjunction with traded real estate equities in foreign markets outside of the U.S.

Overall sentiment has been slightly more bullish in recent months as the sudden market turnaround helped major indices shed most of their bearish performance.

Currently YTD is down but an upward trajectory has many experts suggesting that RWX could possibly rebound in the coming months as market conditions improve. RWX holds a steady yield of 5.49% and has a considerably low expense ratio of 0.59%.

Moreover in the last month RWX has climbed by 5.59% a steady performance as many buyers and investors are looking to start regaining interest in the international real estate market.

FlexShares Global Quality Real Estate ETF

Managed by Northern Trust FlexShares corresponds with the price and yield performance of the Northern Trust Global Quality Real Estate IndexSM.

The investment works alongside the performance of equities that receive major global exposure that hold well-known quality value and momentum.

FlexShares Global Quality Real Estate Index Fund (NYSEARCA:GQRE) holds a one-year yield at 2.71% and has a forward-looking price of $62.54 per share slightly below its 52-week high of $74.34 and above its 52-week low of $54.88 according to recent company insights.

There’s been strong recognition for FlexShares mainly as it focuses on delivering results that are not commonly found with international REITs.

Seeing as it tracks the performance of an underlying index FlexShares is considerably more sustainable for long-term investment and portfolio growth.

Final Thoughts

While market conditions are set to improve in the coming months potential buyers and investors who are interested in real estate investment trusts will need to consider macroeconomic trends that are affecting the broader global performance of the real estate market.

Even as the changing economic cycle has made it increasingly difficult to establish a strategy that will last for the near term it’s considered more feasible to hold onto current investments especially REITs as the market cool-off is set to deliver sizable returns in the long term."

There were no advanced virtual models of the aircraft’s design nor high-speed computing technology to test aerodynamic characteristics early in the development process.

A lot has changed in seven decades.

When the service awarded Boeing a $9.2 billion contract in 2018 to replace the aging training jet with the T-7 Red Hawk the company’s decision to heavily rely on new design and manufacturing techniques made the program the poster child for the potential of digital engineering.

From the start Boeing used advanced manufacturing and digital modeling tools to improve the way it designs and tests the T-7. Rather than send aircraft models to a wind tunnel for early testing the program used high-speed computing shortening the usual concept-to-design process by about nine months. With digital designs on hand earlier the program’s engineers as well as its production and flight teams could better collaborate and anticipate problems reducing the need for rework.

All told Boeing estimates its use of virtual models and 3D tools slashed assembly hours by 80% and halved the time needed for software development.

The Air Force also saw similar wins on other major programs including Sentinel which will replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and its effort to install new wings on the A-10 attack aircraft. Those successes are at least in part an outgrowth of a 2018 push within the Pentagon to modernize acquisition and sustainment processes by establishing digital infrastructure formalizing the use of model-based systems engineering across the services and making deliberate cultural changes to promote innovation.

Siloed organizational constructs and funding processes have made it difficult for the Air Force to transport lessons learned from programs like the T-7 across its broader portfolio of programs. Not all acquisition offices have the funding to buy the necessary software tools and inflexible policies can make it harder to transition long-held processes.

In 2020 the service launched a grassroots initiative dubbed Digital Campaign to implement these shifts. While the effort helped build momentum toward change within the service it lacked a full-time dedicated team. So last summer the Air Force created the Digital Transformation Office to address some challenges that accompany shifts to new ways of operating while also unifying the service’s digital integration efforts.

Kyle Hurst chief of the DTO recently told C4ISRNET his team spent its first year focused on identifying the roadblocks program offices face as they try to adapt from traditional processes — and finding ways to address them across the acquisition enterprise.

“There’s a huge passion and drive to get after this” Hurst said in an Aug. 19 interview. “There is also a huge [number] of roadblocks and barriers in the way.”

Hurst lauded the success of the program offices that have successfully implemented digital engineering noting that the approach helped the A-10 team shave a year off its re-winging schedule and allowed the Sentinel program to optimize and refine its design early in the acquisition process.

However he said that positive progress must be scaled and applied across the service.

“The thing that should be frustrating to the Air Force is that it happens for [a] program and no one else can leverage that benefit” he said. “Our big mission is: How can we get those lessons learned those tools that they’re using and really scale them across the acquisition community?”

‘There is no spoon’

When the Air Force launched its digital campaign in September 2020 it released a 19-page document that cast a vision for moving its development production and sustainment activities into digitally simulated connected environments. The paper titled “There is No Spoon: The New Digital Acquisition Reality” leaned heavily on references to The Matrix — a 1999 science fiction movie depicting a simulated reality complete with illusory utensils. It described what the service called “the next big paradigm shift for military tech dominance.”

“In design engineering software manufacturing testing and sustainment Matrix-like simulation realism is happening: components and processes rendered so realistically they become digital twins of reality” the document said. “Like the movie this means we can learn things in these virtual environments and transfer that learning to the real world.”

Matrix effect

Hurst describes the path to that future as a 20-year journey. And today the service is only about two years in. That early vision helped prioritize digital engineering within the Air Force but there’s still a lot of foundational work that needs to happen to define how the service will get there.

Defining that longer-term path this early on is a challenge Hurst said especially as the Digital Transformation Office is still learning what the service’s needs are and how those play out within individual programs.

“That road map and the struggles we have with how we budget and how we’re so siloed program by program — even at our level we’re still very much learning what that road map needs to look like as we immerse ourselves with programs” Hurst explained.

When program officers and contractors ask the office for a detailed road map he usually emphasizes the need for reliable flexible funding mechanisms foundational infrastructure and digital tools.

Because the DTO has only existed for one year and is still articulating its long-term road map it has struggled to secure enterprise-level funding for its digital acquisition initiatives. Instead money is budgeted by individual program offices based on their resources and how they prioritize digital engineering.

“The Sentinel program has a very good cache of software tools that they can use and do their development with” Hurst said. “A lot of other programs that aren’t so well funded don’t have that.”

Gen. Duke Richardson head of Air Force Materiel Command acknowledged to reporters during an Aug. 11 briefing at the Life Cycle Industry Days conference in Dayton Ohio that there’s a “pay to play” model by which programs that prioritize funding for digital tools are the ones that benefit.

He said the command’s intent is that digital engineering — and the tools that enable it — become “part of the natural course of business.”

More accessibility

One solution the Digital Transformation Office is advocating for is the creation of a cloud-based ecosystem that would host tools making them available to program offices based on their needs. Hurst said the office is working with the Air Force’s Command Control Communications Intelligence and Networks Directorate at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts to establish a central and accessible hub for those tools.

The office is also working to change the approval process for buying new software tools. Today if a program office wants a new piece of software approved for government use it ends up going through a process exceeding 18 months. Often Hurst said a new version of the software was released while the team waited for the OK to move forward.

DTO established a team to map that process and identify ways to improve it.

One of the issues which stemmed from each Air Force base operating on a different network is the numerous approval mechanisms for acquiring software. But now that the Air Force operates on a single network Hurst said it makes sense that instead of having 109 bases with just as many approval processes the service should consolidate that authority to the handful of installations focused on acquisition.

Hurst said the office is planning a pilot effort to better understand the current approval needs create a framework that adheres to those policies and demonstrate a more streamlined approach.

Cold War bomber 21st century tools

While digital tools and processes can improve efficiency and cut time from a program’s schedule having the ability to model aircraft in a digital environment can fundamentally change how the Air Force designs and tests its systems. Digital replicas can help programs understand how the components of a system interact and operate in a simulated environment reducing risk earlier in the program before moving to a physical testing phase.

According to Christopher Garrett a senior-level executive and technical adviser at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center this approach of model-based systems engineering is a key enabler for rapid development.

“You can go fast by making sure that you don’t miss the gaps and that you don’t go down a path that is going to be a dead end” Garrett said in an Aug. 19 interview. “That’s hugely important because we’re constantly going down paths that don’t pan out. We can’t afford to do that.”

As more programs begin to use model-based systems engineering the Digital Transformation Office is training the workforce on modeling software. Garrett said that while most of the 89000 personnel in Air Force Materiel Command will not become modeling experts the goal is to shift the command’s culture so that people have a baseline understanding of how to use these systems.

The Air Force is using digital modeling to develop new aircraft and to upgrade existing systems like the B-52. The storied bomber which entered service in the 1950s is being fitted with new engines a modern radar system and a slew of other enhancements that the Air Force expects will keep it flying into the 2050s.

Col. Louis Ruscetta senior materiel leader in command’s B-52 division told reporters during an Aug. 10 briefing at the Life Cycle Industry Days conference that access to 3D models has helped the program maintain its schedule and anticipate future integration issues.

Ruscetta said he can’t predict whether the modeling tools will shorten the program’s schedule but he could confirm it’s helping reduce risk by identifying issues earlier in the development process.

“When you find problems earlier you have much longer to solve them and you can recover quicker rather than the late problems that arise in other programs” he said.

However when thinking of Floridian airports St. Augustine's Airport is not the first airport that comes to mind in comparison to more significant hubs in Miami and Orlando. What is the history behind Northeast Florida Regional Airport and what does St. Augustine's premier gateway look like now?



The airport is designated for public use with no specific classification (i.e. non-hub) and has six runways. Most notably three of these runways are water runways while the latter is paved. The lengths of the runways vary from 2600 to 12000 feet. The airport is home to two FBOs various aircraft maintenance services flight schools a restaurant and a flying club. The most notable facility at the airport is a Northrop Grumman manufacturing site. This is where Northrup Grumman constructs the E-2D Hawkeye an airborne early-warning aircraft that is carrier capable as well.

Due to its proximity to various naval and air force bases the airport sees occasional traffic patterns of various aircraft such as Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon or the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II. The airport also sees a number of corporate jets especially during peak golf seasons in Florida.

Air Service



Formerly per Jacksonville's Business Journal St. Augustine was served by now-defunct Skybus from Columbus Ohio (CMH) Portsmouth N.H. (PSM) Greensboro N.C. (GSO) Richmond Va. (RIC) and Chicopee Mass. Skybus attempted to establish a low-cost network before filing for Chapter-11 bankruptcy in 2008.

Similarly Frontier Airlines had a stint in Washington Dulles where it tried to establish a base in 2014. The airline pulled out from the airport in 2021. (Photo: Sam B | AeroXplorer)

Frontier Airlines held a brief stint from 2014 at Northeast Florida Regional Airport flying to Philadelphia (PHL) Chicago O-Hare (ORD) Trenton N.J. (TTN) and Washington Dulles (IAD) at some point. During the same period the now-defunct Via Air contributed to service to St. Augustine flying to Charlotte (CLT).

During the airport's peak in 2016 and 2017 the airport had 16090 passengers pass through its doors. For its increase in commercial service the airport erected a new 23000 sq. ft. terminal building in 2016 with four gates.

Northeast Florida Regional Airport saw a hiatus in passenger traffic from 2018 to 2021 when Elite Airways launched flights to New York/Newark (EWR). Currently the airport is solely served by Elite Airways with its regional jet flights to Newark and Portland Maine (PWM).



Ultimately one of the major barriers to further air service is the city's proximity to Jacksonville. Frontier Airlines cited a renewed focus in Jacksonville to leave St. Augustine.

He explains to Cruise Trade News why he thinks the ship will appeal to a wide range of people.

What are you initial thoughts about Norwegian Prima?

It’s a game-changer for a big ship. It’s like they’ve managed to morph together Oceania Cruises’ standard dining Regent Seven Seas Cruises’ luxury feel and Norwegian Cruise Line’s freestyle fun. I was very impressed.

What on-board areas stand out to you?

The whole ship feels new and innovative – every area you visit feels completely different to the last.

The Indulge Food Hall was one of my favourites; the atmosphere the smell of all the different foods the fun of ordering at the table using technology followed up by the smiles of the crew as it was delivered literally seconds later – brilliant.

I also loved that the theatre completely converts into a nightclub.

Who do you think is the typical ideal guest for Norwegian Prima?

I don’t think there is a typical guest for this ship that’s the clever thing the designers have managed to do. They’ve built a ship for everyone.

Will it appeal to UK guests?

I think it will appeal. While UK guests are considered to like more traditional cruising we’re definitely seeing a shift in mindset to try new things especially as the average age of a cruiser continues to come down.

This ship is perfect for a multi-generational family group but I can also see each of the generations enjoying it on their own.

From a selling point of view what would you focus on when pitching Norwegian Prima?

For me the fact that it’s so different the sheer quality of the build the exceptional standard of the food the fun stuff (racetrack slides and so on). Essentially it’s the whole package.

Is NCL on to a winner with Norwegian Prima and the other Prima-class ships that will follow?

As I said previously this class of ship is a game-changer. Everyone I spoke to on the ship said the same so there’s no reason to think that won’t be the same for paying customers.

I genuinely believe they’ve created a class of ship that will appeal to everyone which to date nobody has managed to do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcmN0aWMtc3dpbW1pbmctYnJld2VyeS1zdG9wLWh1c2t5LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtY3J1aXNlLXBsYW5uZXJzLXN2YWxiYXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arctic swimming brewery stop & a husky experience,"On August 28 the Cruise Norway fam trip touched down in Svalbard venturing up the mountainside above Longyearbyen airport to Mine No.3 for a lecture on Svalbard’s rich history as a mining community and dined on soup typical for the area. Donning overalls and a hard hat they explored below ground – a hands-on experience that demonstrated how technology and safety have evolved over the years in mining allowed the group to try their hand at manoeuvring equipment once used by the mining community and dared them to venture into a narrow tunnel.

‘It’s an authentic experience that your guests deserve’ said VisitOSLO’s cruise manager Eva Britt Kornfeldt who works closely with Svalbard Cruise Network and VisitSvalbard.

AIDA Cruises offers the experience to its passengers with its shore excursion programme supervisor Jana Valentine stating ‘I don't have any doubts [about its suitability for passengers] because our mainly German guests are super fit and they like tours which are outdoors which includes walking and active programmes. I think they would crawl into the tunnel. Not all of them but a few most probably.’

Climbing inside the tunnel at Mine No. 3

The experience lasts three hours and operators receive a discount when booking directly with the mine.

The group were shown the steel container containing security copies of the Nordic seed collection and the Global Seed Vault is situated yards from the mine. The gateway to the Arctic World Archive – designed to withstand global disasters and holding manuscripts from the Vatican Library scientific breakthroughs and contemporary cultural treasures – was also visible.

Svalbard Husky experience

After a guided tour of the settlement by coach the participants set out for Advent Valley for an afternoon filled with husky dogs and the chance to learn about their behaviour from experienced husky owner Audun Salte. Every day his 100+ dogs at Svalbard Husky AS run outside the yard and working alongside his veterinarian partner he is vocal about unethical husky owners and against keeping dogs in cages. ‘We explore the connection between dogs and exploration’ noted Salte ‘a lot of our products… are about going out with the dog and having fun with the dog.’

The facility is ‘expanding ourwards building a bigger running yard for the dogs’ with the addition of a dining venue planned for winter that will allow cruise passengers to combine Svalbard Husky-organised activities with refreshments.

Audun Salte Svalbard Husky

Cruise passengers are typically met for dog sledding at the pier but says Salte ‘more and more people are choosing only to visit and spend time with the dogs.’

Continued Valentine ‘I'm always trying to find something new and something great and with Audun I was totally impressed that he said it isn’t the most important point that guests are happy but that the dogs have a good life. I always try to consider sustainability and being here and seeing Svalbard for myself you get a totally new perspective and respect for nature and therefore I think destinations like Svalbard need to be protected. It's great to find sustainable shore excursions which are also good for the locals.’

Swan Hellenic’s senior manager destinations management Daniela Sordi and Mystic Cruises’ itinerary planning & port operations manager Luisa Gómez-Albo Sanchís revealed they would ‘consider’ a husky experience on each of their itineraries.

Svalbard Husky is currently working on an initiative to transform bio-gas from the animals’ waste.

The northernmost brewery in the world

A trip to the northernmost brewery followed with a story connected with each beverage its founder and how it came to fruition shared with every mouthful. Background on alcohol consumption on the archipelago and a concise step by step retelling on how the beverages are made accompanied the tasting. A glass wall in the intimate venue where tastings are held enables visitors to watch over the production process in action.

The venue is suitable for 50 passengers at a time and the maximum number served in a single day is 300 – a figure reached this summer. Locally made food can be served to cruise passengers during the tastings or tastings can be carried out at alternative dining venues in Longyearbyen to suit need.

Svalbard Brewery

Glacial water malt from Finland and hops from the US make up the ingredients with 2000 cans packed every hour. The alcohol is served onboard Hurtigruten and AIDA Cruises vessels among others to support local trade.

During the visit cruise lines were shown a presentation by founder of Arctic Husky Travellers and veteran of multiple dog sledding trips to the North Pole Tommy Jordbrudal who painted a picture of his experiences with huskies – and encounters with polar bears.

SvalBad floating sauna

A dip in the arctic waters outside of Port Longyear against a backdrop of snow topped peaks followed a visit to the recently opened SvalBad floating sauna. ‘They’re very popular people have got onto the Nordic floating saunas in Oslo too’ stated Kornfeldt of the concept’s growing popularity. Beverages and a light snack can be served to passengers during the activity.

Svalbard Museum

Svalbard Museum is open 10-5pm year-round except Christmas Day and suitable for approximately 40 cruise passengers at one time according to Saskia Heynecamp who works at the museum and helps coordinate and deliver guided tours. The venue relocated in 2006; now less than 2km from Port Longyear it reaps the rewards for being next door to the Norwegian Polar Institute and The University Centre in Svalbard benefitting from new exhibitions showcasing latest research like the permafrost exhibition currently on display.

Natural history ecology and cultural traditions through the ages are curated at the museum. ‘We work strongly with guides [coming with passengers]. It is useful because the museum is only in English and Norwegian’ remarks Heynecamp who is enthusiastic at the concept of cruise lines using local tour guides who have sound knowledge of the museum. ‘An hour is a good time to be here for passengers – but ideally 1.5 hours.’ Early opening options are available for operators. The museum shop sells jewellery art and a selection of handmade goods produced locally with purchases supporting the local community.

Oslo whistlestop tour

Prior to Svalbard the fam trip assembled in Oslo for a whistlestop tour of the city delivered by Oslo Guide Bureau. Operational since 1996 it has 200 guides and are ‘always dependable and on time’ according to one guide Marit Utaker.

A brisk walking tour of the city centre took in the Opera House and Munch Museum just a stone’s throw from the port before a sightseeing car ride past the cathedral Norwegian Parliament Oslo University the Royal Palace and the Akershus Fortress and Castle. The party were then offered a moving tour of the Holocaust Museum – today filled with an exhibition about hidden racism – and shown the secret bunker of Nazi sympathiser Vidkun Quisling during WW2 with a 45 minute tour being most suitable for passengers.

In 2026 a new viking museum will open in the city.

‘Oslo is attractive it is the capital of Norway and it’s a destination people know’ said Hans Lind director itinerary planning Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings which has Oslo on its itineraries through to 2025. Attractions like the Holocaust Museum and others are ‘very attractive for the clientele onboard Regent Seven Sean Cruises and Oceania Cruises’ in particular with Norwegian Cruise Line’s ‘younger crowd’ instead frequenting restaurants or participating in family-oriented activities. Michelle Sanchez shorex coordinator – Caribbean Norwegian Cruise Line reiterates that Oslo’s many museums are especially suitable for mature cruise travellers.

Passengers can expect to spend up to 45 minutes at the museum which can be combined with Huk beach less than five minutes away by vehicle.

Bygdøy Peninsula

Together with hiking trails and beaches Bygdøy Peninsula near the city centre is also enriched by a handful of museums. There fam trip participants had the chance to encounter the country’s oldest boat at the Norwegian Maritime Museum before a unique tour of the Fram Museum housing Fridtjof Nansen’s polar sailing vessel Fram.

A few metres away the Kon-Tiki Museum houses the archives of Thor Heyerdahl – one of history’s most famous explorers – recognised by UNESCO for their contribution to world heritage. The original Kon-Tiki raft used to cross the Pacific Ocean and reed boat Ra can be seen plus original artefacts from Heyerdahl’s travels including figures from Easter Island as well as a giant moai replica.

The venue’s trademark beverage ‘Kon-Tiki Landing’ plus snacks were served during a 10-minute film documenting Heyerdahl’s adventures with a longer one-hour Academy Award winning version showing in the film room which can hold 60 passengers. Lectures about Heyerdahl’s sea crossings archaeological excavations and more are offered in the museum’s auditorium which holds 55 passengers.

The short answer then is that if nuclear power plants can be used flexibly it does not mean that in France nuclear power plants will come to the rescue as soon as the sun sets. Coincidentally Dutch nuclear energy research center NRG recently reported that they are investigating precisely this for French EDF: How to make nuclear fuel more resistant to ""transients"" (changes in reactor power) because according to experts at NRG: ""At the moment [French] nuclear power plants are designed to operate at a constant power: it's on or off.""

In short: The VVD the dutch right wing liberals bluntly allege that nuclear power plants in France are turned up and down according to power demand.

French nuclear power giant EDF claims that this is indeed the case while remaining very vague about how much and how often it modulates its nuclear power plants.

Figures from French grid operator RTE show that in 2019 French Nuclear power plants are not following demand.

Inflexible French nuclear power had to be complemented and skimmed with flexible daily and seasonal energy storage exactly the kind of storage that comes into the picture with a 100% renewable power system without nuclear power plants.

In the words of former VVD backbencher Mark Harbers now Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management (without nuclear power in his portfolio):

Is nuclear power controllable?

The agreements in the National Climate Deal should lead to 70% of electricity being produced from renewable sources by 2030. Critics will point out that nuclear power stations would therefore no longer fit into the Dutch energy mix. Because of the costs involved nuclear power stations must operate as base load and so in their view they are not suitable as a back-up to provide power at peak demand.

The latter is a myth by the way: nuclear power plants can also be regulated up and down very easily. Otherwise of course a country like France would not be able to obtain 70% of its electricity supply from nuclear power plants. But in combination with the other sustainable sources wind and solar nuclear can offer the necessary stability so that you can build an optimal energy system for the Netherlands.

A myth?

As is often the case in politics it's all about the little words here. A nuclear power plant can of course be switched on and off. It just prefers not to do so. The reason being that with power changes in the nuclear reactor there are also significant temperature and radiation changes. And a nuclear reactor can't stand those too well. Temperature changes and ageing also occur in conventional power plants but the big difference is: if a gas turbine fails you can simply repair it. Inside a nuclear power plant a large part of the installation is highly radioactive so maintenance is already expensive and complex and extra maintenance completely unattractive.

Also for good reason regulation for a nuclear power plant are more stringent than those for conventional power plants. Where a gas turbine can probably keep on running with a leaky cooling system with a nuclear power plant this is impossible. So maintenance is more complicated and the tolerance for failure is lower. Two important factors why for example nuclear power plants continue to feed electricity into the grid even when the price of electricity is negative: it is better to lose money producing electricity than risking the installation and (even higher) costs by tuning up and down.

So what about France?

Since the 1980s on a daily basis surplus French nuclear power has been used to fill large water reservoirs in and around France. When the electricity demand peaks in the evening the plug is pulled on the reservoirs and the pumps operate in turbine mode. But with the rise of renewable energy also in France that system is beginning to wear: At peak times renewables already supply a quarter of what French nuclear power plants produce with uranium and the renewable share is increasing every year. That is why EDF has been experimenting with the flexible use of nuclear power plants for years. However EDF is not very forthcoming with details.

In 2019 the French group reported [archive] that their nuclear plants had between 30 and 70 transients per year. Only they didn't tell how large these modulations were. With 58 nuclear reactors EDF could switch a number of reactors daily but in France in summer around 50 GW is consumed during the day and 35 GW in the night. To make up for that difference at least ten nuclear reactors would have to be switched on and off every day. And EDF won't get there with 30-70 transients per reactor per year. And according to the figures of the French network manager RTE it doesn't even try: the vast majority of transients per hour are less than 10% of reactor capacity. And you don't replenish peak demand with that. You can see that EDF sacrifices a few nuclear reactors to modulate frequently (including Golfech-1 Paluel-3 Tricastin-3 Cattenom 2&4) but on the whole load this doesn't have a significant impact.

legend: red: nuclear

yellow: wind and solar

black: fossil

blue: other dispatchable (im/export hydro/pump biomass)

brown line: demand

We also looked at the French power mix of pre-Corona year 2019 to see to what extent the French nuclear power arsenal as a whole follows demand plus renewable generation and how much (fossil) backup was needed. You then see that nuclear power plants were indeed only switched on and on for a very limited extent: In winter the daily variation in demand is almost entirely met by (non-nuclear) dispatchable capacity. Once a peak in wind is announced the nuclear reactors do not switch back enough and wind energy is evacuated from the grid using export and pumped storage (i.e. negative power).

The same is true for the summer: Online nuclear power plants vary little in their daily power output; the daily demand peaks are met with solar (and wind). Each night surplus nuclear (and fossil!) electricity is exported. In mid-August a number of nuclear power plants tune down which then results in a shortage of power so in mid-August hydroelectric plants have to step in (the blue peaks). When the nuclear power plants are then tuned back up there is again too much power for French demand.

What does this mean for the Netherlands?

As the VVD pointed out: The Climate Deal must lead to 70% of electricity being produced from renewable sources by 2030. Even with the current pro nuclear government' plans times three the Netherlands will not have nuclear capacity similar with France. The Dutch electricity system is and will remain very different from the French. So it is remarkable that the VVD uses a reference to France to push for nuclear energy in the Netherlands. But anyway.

So we see that contrary to what the VVD seems to want to suggest French nuclear power does not follow demand. Of course with 58 nuclear reactors you always have a bit of variation but that is far too little to match the daily demand curve. In the Netherlands one (Borssele) or three nuclear power plants (current governments dreams) won't be able to do that either. What's more in France there is a large reliance on dispatchable capacity including some 4 GW of pumped storage capacity 16.8 GW of hydropower and -17.8 GW / +8.8 GW of im/export. And this is perhaps the most interesting part of the French power mix: What they use to match demand is not nuclear but seasonal storage (hydro) and daytime storage (pumped hydro).

Because that is exactly what every energy expert says is required for a resilient 100% renewable (Dutch) power mix: Seasonal and daily storage. Only there are no reservoirs here so for day storage we are thinking of batteries and for seasonal storage - and the mythical Dunkelflaute - hydrogen. In addition to but so much you know energy efficiency and industrial demand management.

What about NRG's research?

EDF officials had explained in 2019 that with their sophisticated irradiation strategy no real problems occurred and that ""hot spots"" in the fuel are avoided with flexible use (p. 15-16 heading ""V.B.""). But we see now that this ""flexible use"" is rather limited. So what is being investigated in the Petten research reactor?

From NRG's news release:

In December 2020 EDF (Électricité de France) and NRG have started a cooperation on the irradiation of containment tubes. Purpose of the irradiation is to gain knowledge on the behavior of containment tubes under operating conditions that are to be considered off normal.

Dutch Energy trade magazine Energeia took a closer look:

The French energy giant EDF owner of 58 nuclear reactors in its own country also sees benefits in making nuclear power production more flexible. This is currently difficult and this is mainly due to the material from which the tubes are made that house the fuel rods - the nuclear fuel. Thermal stress

This material usually graphite has poor resistance to varying thermal stress in the corrosive environment in which it must do its work. While flexible deployment of nuclear power plants means that there will be a lot of varying temperatures and therefore thermal stress.

EDF now believes it has developed a new material that can cope well with this new situation and associated thermal stress. What material it is remains unnamed. Even the question of whether the new stuff has a base of graphite remains unanswered.

To get proof that this material can indeed handle varying thermal stress experiments must be conducted. The High Flux Reactor in Petten has been chosen as the test site where NRG can also conduct nuclear tests while producing medical isotopes.

Now we can better place NRG's press release. After all the organisation in Petten has been trying for some time to convince the Dutch government to invest €2 billion in a new nuclear research reactor. So a strategic press release about research into the flexible use of nuclear energy seemed a good idea. At the same time of course the likelihood that EDF has discovered a material with which nuclear power plants can be switched on and off without any significant restrictions seems rather small.

Just a quick look at the date of NRG's press release? Ah yes July 26. ""Nuclear reactor operator NRG is going to irradiate something"". In Dutch we call this ""Cucumber season"".

Speaking on MetroNews “Talkline” in recent days Nucor Vice-President and General Manager John Farris said they company has set up its headquarters temporarily in the old Mason County Armory and continued to lay the ground work for construction.

“We’ve got about 20 people on the team currently and about 80 percent of the equipment is already purchased and we are getting things underway” he explained.

The groundbreaking is slated to be held later this year or possibly next year. The company is currently going through the permitting process. It has secured all of its state permits. It is still working the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on other permites.

The sprawling plant to be built along the Ohio River and Route 2 south of Point Pleasant will take about two years to construct. According to Farris at the height of construction they expect as many as 2000 construction workers on the job. Once in full operation the plant will provide 800 permanent full-time jobs.

“We’re going to need contractors from wherever we can get them. Obviously our preference will be contractors from within West Virginia. So far we’ve selected two and we’ve got many many more to go” Farris told MetroNews.

The plant has stirred excitement all over the state and is generating buzz that could draw a lot of former West Virginians back home to take new jobs in Mason County. According to Farris it’s already happening. His first employee of the new facility is a native West Virginian who lived in Charlotte and had worked for nearly three decades for Nucor. Farris said the lady banged on his office door the moment the West Virginia project was announced and said she wanted to join his team.

“She grew up in Clarksburg West Virginia and she was officially the first person I hired for this project. To see the tears on her face and her joy and happiness just to get back to her home state was unbelievable” he said.

JPR's latest report notes that add-in-board market share saw NVIDIA increase up to 79% of the discrete GPU market share in Q2 2022 up from 75% in Q1 2022 and up from 80% back this time last year in Q2 2021. AMD is back down to 20% of the discrete GPU market share down from 24% in Q1 2022 but back to the same 20% that the company had in Q2 2021.

We also see that Intel has eaten that 1% left of the discrete GPU market share in the last couple of quarters whereas Intel now has (probably less than) 1% of the GPU market share according to JPR data. This is the same as last quarter but up from 0% (because Intel didn't have discrete GPUs then) back in Q2 2021.

JPR also notes that AIB shipments during Q2 2022 decreased from Q1 2022 by a rather large -22.6% which is below the 10-year average of -9.7%. Total AIB shipments increased by 2.4% in Q2 2022 from last year up to 10.4 million units but down from 13.38 million units in Q1 2022.

NVIDIA saw its quarter-to-quarter shipments sinking by -19.1% but they increased by 3% from last year... their total GPU market share is still at a ""dominant"" 79.6% in Q2 2022 says JPR. AMD on the other hand had its quarter-to-quarter shipments really sinking down by a much worse -34% and from last year the company saw a decrease of -5% or so.

While Nvidia will still require an export license to sell to customers in China Nvidia is able to continue to support its US customers existing A100 projects and ensure continued logistic operations via its Hong Kong business until September 1 2023. Here's the SEC filing in full:

""The U.S. government has authorized exports reexports and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation’s or the Company’s development of H100 integrated circuits after the Company filed its Current Report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 31 2022. The authorization also allows the Company to perform exports needed to provide support for U.S. customers of A100 through March 1 2023. Additionally the U.S. government authorized A100 and H100 order fulfillment and logistics through the Company’s Hong Kong facility through September 1 2023.""

Original story: On Wednesday US officials ordered Nvidia to halt sales of two of its chips to China. This means that Nvidia won't be allowed to sell its A100 and H100-powered data center super-GPUs to China.

Nvidia told Reuters that US officials claim this new rule ""will address the risk that products may be used in or diverted to a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in China.""

According to the SEC filings Nvidia stands to lose $400 million in sales from the two chips being banned potentially hurting China's advanced computing capabilities for civilian and military applications.



""We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren’t sufficient"" an Nvidia representative told me. ""The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100 H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.""

Outside of the order the US Department of Commerce has not explained what prompted the decision outside of keeping ""advanced technologies out of the wrong hands.""

The Chinese foreign ministry responded in state media on Thursday by accusing the US of imposing a ""tech blockade"" that would affect the stability of global supply chains. The Chinese commerce ministry says the US ""continues to abuse export control measures to restrict semiconductor-related items to China.""



Nvidia will be applying for a license to continue some exports to China but hasn't said if it expects the US will grant the exemption. The SEC filing also noted that Nvidia does not currently sell any of its chips to Russia.

This isn't the first time the US has stopped chipmakers from selling to China. In 2019 the US government put smartphone maker Huawei on an export blacklist citing national security concerns. This prevented US suppliers from selling to the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker at the time.

AMD has also stated that it will prevent its MI250 AI chips from being exported to China although the company told Reuters that it believes the new rules will not affect business. Regardless these new bans won't help the already tense relationship between the US and China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXN0b2NrLXNwbGl0LW52ZGEtc3RvY2stcHJpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Stock Split | Will the NVDA Share Price Recover?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXN0b2NrLXNwbGl0LW52ZGEtc3RvY2stcHJpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001670F36A290>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXN0b2NrLXNwbGl0LW52ZGEtc3RvY2stcHJpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Like other states in the nation it wasn’t a big shock that America’s largest lender also topped the charts in Maryland.

Yes I’m referring to Rocket Mortgage which had no problem beating out another 750 or so banks mortgage lenders and credit unions to take the #1 spot.

Collectively these mortgage companies originated about $140 billion in home loans in the Old Line State last year.

Read on to see who else ranked in the top 10 including some local names.

Top Mortgage Lenders in Maryland (Overall)

Ranking Company Name 2021 Loan Volume 1. Rocket Mortgage $8.7 billion 2. Pennymac $6.0 billion 3. Truist Financial $5.7 billion 4. Freedom Mortgage $5.1 billion 5. Wells Fargo $4.1 billion 6. First Home Mortgage $3.9 billion 7. Mr. Cooper $3.6 billion 8. U.S. Bank $3.5 billion 9. UWM $3.1 billion 10. Caliber Home Loans $2.9 billion

As stated Rocket Mortgage led the way in Maryland with an admirable $8.7 billion in home loan volume in 2021 per HMDA data courtesy of Richey May.

That was more than enough to beat out second place Pennymac’s $6 billion. Many consumers may not even recognize Pennymac as they do a lot of business via the correspondent channel.

This means their product is resold by smaller companies whether it’s a local credit union or bank.

In third was Truist with a very close $5.7 billion – the bank is also headquartered relatively close to Maryland in Charlotte North Carolina.

Freedom Mortgage took the fourth slot with $5.1 billion while Wells Fargo grabbed fifth with $4.1 billion.

The rest of top 10 included First Home Mortgage Mr. Cooper U.S. Bank United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) and Caliber Home Loans.

First Home Mortgage is a local mortgage lender based in Baltimore MD.

Top Maryland Mortgage Lenders (for Home Buyers)

Ranking Company Name 2021 Loan Volume 1. Truist Financial $2.5 billion 2. First Home Mortgage $2.5 billion 3. Pennymac $2.4 billion 4. U.S. Bank $2.2 billion 5. Caliber Home Loans $1.5 billion 6. Wells Fargo $1.4 billion 7. Rocket Mortgage $1.4 billion 8. AmeriHome Mortgage $1.2 billion 9. UWM $1.2 billion 10. NVR Mortgage $1.1 billion

If we only take into account home purchase loans Truist holds top honors in the state with $2.5 billion funded.

It appeared to be just enough to prevent local lender First Home Mortgage (also rounded up to $2.5 billion) from being #1 for home buyers in Maryland.

Third placed-Pennymac was also right on their heels with $2.4 billion in home purchase loans funded last year.

U.S. Bank was also in the mix with $2.2 billion funded followed by Caliber Home Loans with $1.5 billion.

The other five in the top 10 included Wells Fargo Rocket Mortgage AmeriHome Mortgage UWM and NVR Mortgage.

NVR Mortgage is actually a wholly-owned subsidiary of home builder NVR Inc. the parent company of Ryan Homes NVHomes and Heartland Homes.

Top Maryland Refinance Lenders (for Existing Homeowners)

Ranking Company Name 2021 Loan Volume 1. Rocket Mortgage $7.3 billion 2. Freedom Mortgage $4.2 billion 3. Pennymac $3.7 billion 4. Truist Financial $3.1 billion 5. Mr. Cooper $2.6 billion 6. Wells Fargo $2.5 billion 7. loanDepot $2.4 billion 8. Newrez $2.0 billion 9. UWM $1.9 billion 10. AmeriHome Mortgage $1.5 billion

When we filter out the loans to home buyers and focus solely on mortgage refinances to existing homeowners Rocket Mortgage is easily the top lender in the state of Maryland.

The Detroit-based mortgage giant funded $7.3 billion in refis there last year nearly doubling the volume of second place Freedom Mortgage.

Pennymac had another strong showing with $3.7 billion funded for third place followed by Truist with $3.1 billion and Mr. Cooper with $2.6 billion.

Places six through 10 went to Wells Fargo loanDepot Newrez UWM and AmeriHome Mortgage.

All in all there weren’t a lot of shockers here with big national brands taking all the top spots.

Perhaps the only surprise is that no Maryland-based mortgage lenders made the list.

Top Mortgage Lenders in Baltimore

Ranking Company Name 2021 Loan Volume 1. Rocket Mortgage $3.6 billion 2. Pennymac $2.5 billion 3. Truist Financial $2.4 billion 4. Freedom Mortgage $2.1 billion 5. First Home Mortgage $1.9 billion 6. Wells Fargo $1.8 billion 7. U.S. Bank $1.5 billion 8. Mr. Cooper $1.4 billion 9. UWM $1.4 billion 10. Newrez $1.3 billion

Who Is the Best Mortgage Lender in Maryland?

If we’re talking best and not the biggest as seen in the lists above different names could take the cake.

While First Home Mortgage does have a stellar 4.98-star rating on Zillow from over 7500 customer reviews other Maryland-based mortgage companies like NFM Lending and Homespire Mortgage do too.

In fact Homespire has a 4.98-star rating also and NFM has a 4.96-star rating. Meanwhile Rockville MD-based Apex Home Loans holds a superior 4.99-star rating.

Similarly strong ratings can be found at Homeside Financial and Direct Mortgage Loans LLC both natives of Maryland.

So while big is one thing best might be another. Or you might get lucky and find the best of both worlds in one lender.

Either way take the time to look at more than one lender if you want to find the best fit and pricing for your home loan needs.

(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration published its strategy for subsidizing US output of semiconductors with the first phase of funding potentially being rolled out next spring Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.

Smaller simpler projects involving expansion of existing facilities will be the first to receive funds followed by more complex projects for so-called leading-edge chips which the US currently doesn’t produce but consumes more than 25% of global supply Raimondo told reporters in Washington Tuesday.

The plan -- known as Chips for America -- allocates $28 billion for domestic production of leading-edge logic and memory chips about $10 billion for new capacity to build current-generation chips and semiconductors and $11 billion for a new National Semiconductor Technology Center manufacturing institutes and other development programs the Department of Commerce said in a statement accompanying the strategy’s release.

“We’re going to be pushing companies to go bigger and be bolder” Raimondo said in Washington. “So if a company already has funding now for $10 billion project we want them to think bigger and and convince us how they can go from $10 billion to $50 billion with use of the taxpayer financing.”

President Joe Biden signed the $52 billion Chips and Science Act legislation into law Aug. 9. It’s the centerpiece of his administration’s effort to reduce dependence on Asian suppliers like Taiwan and South Korea whose local companies are leading the global market and to address supply-chain disruptions and resulting price hikes for certain goods containing semiconductors.

Commerce will release funding documents that will provide specific application guidance for the program by early February it said.

“Awards and loans will be made on a rolling basis as soon as applications can be responsibly processed evaluated and negotiated” it said.

There are clear guardrails on the money in that companies can’t use the funds for stock buybacks Raimondo said. The department will ensure those who receive chips funds can’t compromise national security by investing in China.

The department also will have the ability to claw back money if a recipient company fails to start or complete a project on time Raimondo said.

(Updates with comment from Raimondo in first paragraph.)

The E/E architecture and software coding of vehicles became increasingly complicated making them more susceptible to cyber attacks. Therefore the market for automotive cyber security solutions has been growing quickly in order to protect the vehicles from such attacks. Car connection and safety are gradually taking center stage in mid-range and luxury vehicles.



A recent study conducted by the strategic consulting and market research firm BlueWeave Consulting revealed that the Global Automotive Cyber Security market was worth USD 2.1 billion in the year 2021. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% earning revenues of around USD 7.5 billion by the end of 2028. The Global Automotive Cyber Security market is booming due to the rising desire for connected and semi-autonomous vehicles. The E/E architecture and software coding of vehicles became increasingly complicated making them more susceptible to cyber-attacks. Therefore the market for automotive cyber security solutions has been growing quickly in order to protect vehicles from such attacks. Car connection and safety are gradually taking center stage in mid-range and luxury vehicles. Government efforts to create an intelligent transportation system have also increased global demand for automotive cyber security solutions.

Governmental Efforts to Adopt Connected Car Technology Is Driving Market Growth

The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) is committed to fostering creativity security and a new mode of transportation while maintaining the nation's position as a global leader in automation. Therefore the USDOT is serving as a convener and facilitator working with a large coalition of industry academic state and municipal safety advocacy and transportation partners in order to aid in the safe development testing and integration of connected vehicle technology. The USDOT created the Automated Vehicles Comprehensive Plan in January 2021 with the aim of increasing the Department's efforts to prioritize safety while making transportation-related plans for the future.

In order to realize this vision for Automated Driving Systems (ADS) the plan outlines three goals: prepare the transportation system modernize the regulatory environment and foster cooperation and openness. These goals are all based on concepts presented in the program for Automated Vehicles (AV) 4.0. Additionally the European Commission gave automakers instructions in 2016 to ensure that new models feature a variety of digital technologies that helps lower fuel consumption and make roads safer as part of an EU policy on internet-connected vehicles. In the European markets a number of firms have introduced their linked car models including Volkswagen and Renault Nissan Alliance. The cyber security ecosystem is of utmost importance to protect connected vehicles against evolving cyber-attacks. These governmental measures are anticipated to hasten connected car development worldwide. The growing demand for connected automobiles is anticipated to drive the growth of the worldwide automotive cyber security market during the projected period.

In-Vehicle Segment Is Anticipated To Dominate The Market By Form

On the basis of form the market is segmented into in-vehicle and external cloud services. In- Vehicle segment is likely to show the largest growth over the forecast period. In comparison to a car with a complicated electronic architecture which may have more than 100 ECUs the average vehicle has 60 to 70 installed Electronic Control Units (ECU). ECU and domain controller integration for a variety of applications is something OEMs and tier 1 firms are eager to do. Real-time communication between numerous ECUs is crucial for maintaining a vehicle's overall safety. Additionally if technology in automobiles like autonomous braking and remote starting were in the hands of distant enemies they would have an effect on various scales. ECUs are capable of skid detection anti-lock braking and crash prediction. ECUs connect with one another using protocols such as Ethernet LIN MOST CAN FlexRay and Ethernet. OEMs and suppliers of cyber security solutions for the automotive industry are actively developing security mechanisms and are in the early stages of generating electronic content.

Asia Pacific Market Held The Largest Market Share In 2021

The greatest market share in 2021 was held by the Asia Pacific followed by North America and Europe. The major drivers propelling the automotive cyber security market in the Asia Pacific are the increased awareness of both active and passive security measures among consumers and the growing sales of medium and luxurious automobiles. In terms of value China is anticipated to have the most influence on the Asia Pacific V2X cyber security market. The high sales of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class which is fitted with V2X particularly V2C and V2I can also be ascribed to China's significant market share. Additionally as more electric vehicles are used there will be greater demand for V2X technologies like V2P and V2G which are well suited for electric vehicles. Moreover in the coming years the market for automotive control units will benefit from rising standards for passive vehicle safety and vehicle exhaust emissions. Opportunities for players in the automotive cyber security ecosystem are anticipated to result from this. The Asia Pacific would dominate the global Automotive Cyber Security Market over the forecast period as a result of all the aforementioned factors.

Due to low labor costs simplicity of doing business and readily available raw materials some OEMs have relocated their vehicle production facilities to developing nations. There are production centers for a number of well-known semiconductor firms in the Asia Pacific region. They are able to keep up an efficient supply chain for the manufacturers owing to this. Automotive cyber security is predicted to become more popular as the connected vehicle market expands in the Asia Pacific area. The need for cyber security in these vehicles will grow as there are more connected vehicles on the road.

What's Wrong?,"Founded in 2007 Saankhya Labs is one of the few Indian fabless companies that has steered through many a tough time since its inception. With 73 international patents Saankhya has been developing its own chips building software-defined radio chipsets and it is the only non-telecom company to be allotted 5G spectrum for trials. And recently optical networking products vendor and Tata group entity Tejas Networks acquired a 64.40 per cent stake in it for Rs 283.94 crore in cash.

But this journey wasn’t easy. The company survived with initial funding of just $2 million raised from family and friends between 2007 and 2011. “Since venture capitalists (VCs) always look for customer validation our biggest challenge was not having a local customer and ecosystem that could vouch for our product. Ultimately one of our US-based customers endorsed it and that enabled investment” explains Hemant Mallapur Co-founder and EVP of Engineering at Saankhya Labs.

After pursuing Intel Capital the VC arm of the world’s largest chipmaker for years Saankhya finally got its backing in 2011. Today its cumulative funding over the past 15 years stands at about $30 million from strategic investors such as Intel General Motors and Sinclair Broadcast Group among others. Instead of investing as a pure-play VC all of them invested because they were interested in its technology believe Saankhya Labs’ officials. But not all start-ups have been able to raise funding at an opportune time. Take the case of Ecvinox an edge AI SoC (system on chip) venture that was promoted by Kumar Vemuri but folded up due to insufficient funding. Or NeuBionix a medical implant start-up promoted by Mohan Kumar R. along with a partner from the US. They needed at least $5-10 million at a pre-seed round but could only get partial commitments due to which they had to abandon their project of developing a flexible neurological chip that could harness the glucose present in the body to power it.

Although both were excellent ventures in terms of the promoter team and business potential it is quite difficult to raise money for chip start-ups in India says Muthukrishnan C. CEO of Semiconductor Fabless Acceleration Lab (SFAL). But even though India might not be a silicon manufacturing hub it has emerged as a preferred destination among global chip companies to hire exceptional design talent. Engineers from India now make up around 20 per cent of the world’s semiconductor designers industry participants say. That translates to over 120000 design engineers largely working with global chip manufacturers and domestic design companies while some work independently. No wonder then that over 90 per cent of the world’s biggest fab and fabless players including Intel Samsung Semiconductors NVIDIA Qualcomm Micron Technology and NXP Semiconductors have R&D centres in India.

SFAL’s Muthukrishnan who rates Indian engineers at 9 on a scale of 10 explains “Through MNC design centres Indian engineers impact every complex IC/ASIC/SoC (integrated circuit/application specific IC) done in the world today. They are involved in every stage of the design process—from specifications to architecture; design and physical implementation to verification all the way up to post-manufacturing testing and qualification.” SFAL a centre of excellence for the fabless community has helped three companies raise Rs 18 crore from four funds in a span of three years. Yet despite the available design talent in the country start-ups in the space are struggling.

The Funding Challenge

Although a critical component capable of bringing the world to a stop securing funding for start-ups in the space is a challenge. Founder and Executive Managing Partner of Indo-US Venture Partners Vinod Dham says “The major challenges [of chip design] are product conceptualisation market funding and building the team both on the deep technical side and the business side. Getting customer traction for these start-ups is also very challenging.”

Typically a chip start-up’s initial requirement ranges from $2-15 million-plus based on the complexity of the chip design. Even at the pre-seed stage they need funds close to 8-10 times of what an average service aggregator start-up needs. Plus it takes over two years to develop a medium complexity chip with numerous iterations. These two factors result in a longer wait time for the start-ups and their investors to reap any return on investment.

For instance Chipspirit has developed a chip that converts plain-text data into encrypted-text data and then communicates it over public networks. A completely software-free product that is extremely difficult to crack into it won the iDEX Defence India Startup Challenge I by solving for a problem statement that required developing a secure hardware encryption device. Mohan Jindal Founder and CEO of Chipspirit says “Our prototype is ready and proven in lab trials and we are already working towards customer trials. However we are facing challenges as our first product is targeted towards defence which makes it harder.” Bootstrapped the start-up isn’t funded yet.

Globally raising funds for chip start-ups is not that difficult but Indian start-ups are struggling for support. “It is hard as there are not many success stories. Whereas chip companies that fund start-ups through their VC arms also operate like other VC funds and hence similar challenges exist for them” says Satya Gupta President of the VLSI Society of India. The country has only a few investors that have invested in such start-ups—like YourNest Venture Capital and growX ventures that have co-invested in LightSpeedAI Labs.

Also most of the semiconductor start-ups in the West have strong academic linkages that help them have an extended pool of scientists and engineers working on the problem. Highlighting the necessity of such linkages P.N. Sudarshan Partner and TMT Industry Leader at Deloitte India says that ecosystem maturity is vital for design start-ups to thrive in India. “The funding ecosystem [in the West] is fairly mature with investors from semiconductor backgrounds actively investing in the ecosystem. Also the linkages between investors founders and the industry in terms of accessing downstream electronic products are much better. The semiconductor industry in India is largely services oriented with very few success stories among product companies” he adds.

But even though strong industry linkages and a specific background in chip companies give an edge it does not guarantee funding. An example is Tushar K. Bhattacharyya who is the Co-founder and CEO of AB Circuits and Research Labs (ABCRL) that is developing a device to monitor the health of a vehicle’s tyres. Even with a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering along with the experience of working with chip giants such as Qualcomm Renesas Electronics and Intersil Bhattacharyya’s ABCRL has struggled to raise the necessary funding.

Bootstrapped it is in the advanced stages of its chip design journey. And his past experience has only helped him solve a lot of the technical issues that crop-up during product development. “We make tyre pressure monitoring sensors and we see that a lot of them are imported by Indian OEMs currently. Having tested our technology at the Center for Electric Vehicle and Intelligent Transport Systems (CEVITS) at IIT Indore we hope OEMs will start buying from local companies like us” says Bhattacharyya. Now being incubated at SFAL ABCRL finally has good visibility of the market and funding.

Even though funding for global chip start-ups runs into billions of dollars it is focussed on geographies like the US China and Israel among other countries which according to industry players could be working to the domestic ecosystem’s disadvantage. “With time we realised that funding would have been easier if we were based in the US Israel Korea or Taiwan” says Saankhya’s Mallapur.

Gearing Up

Although India’s contribution to the global semiconductor ecosystem in terms of value addition is small—around $10-20 million—industry players believe that in light of recent geopolitical challenges supply chain issues strategic needs and the localisation push by governments across the world these figures will change dramatically in a few years. SFAL forecasts that investments will touch a few hundred million at the low end and reach $1-2 billion at the high end in five years’ time.

Recognising the need for a thriving chip industry the government has introduced a Rs 76000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the domestic players that includes outlays for silicon and display fabs as well. As a result the Indian semiconductor market—that was valued at $27 billion in 2021—is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 16 per cent from 2019 to 2026 to reach $64 billion by 2026 shows a joint study by Counterpoint Research and the India Electronic and Semiconductor Association (IESA). “Currently only 9 per cent of the Indian consumption is met locally. To achieve India’s semiconductor vision the focus must be on incentivising the design ecosystem in a manner that can have a cascading effect in the industry and help create a stronger foundation for design-led manufacturing and allied sectors” says Shivani Parashar Research Analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Dham concurs. “Chip start-ups need support on funding access to electronic design automation (EDA) tools pre-designed IP (intellectual property) blocks and manufacturing aid from the government” he says. To that end the government has introduced a design-linked incentive (DLI) component with a Rs1000-crore outlay under the PLI scheme where fabless and systems start-ups MSMEs and established domestic companies can make reimbursement claims up to 50 per cent of eligible spending with a ceiling of Rs 15 crore. It will also offer technical support through its national EDA and IP infrastructure. On the other hand state governments too are supporting early-stage fabless companies under their start-up initiatives and policies.

For instance the Karnataka government in collaboration with IESA is providing Indian fabless start-ups with access to exorbitantly expensive R&D infrastructure to enable them to design and develop prototypes under SFAL. “We are No. 1 when it comes to semiconductor designing and we are trying to scale this further” says Dr Ashwathnarayan C. N. Information Technology Minister with the Karnataka government. On top of the support from governments established fabless players and large business houses can also play a significant role in supporting design start-ups through demand aggregation and initiatives like the preference for make-in-India products industry insiders feel. Companies such as Qualcomm and NXP have launched initiatives to mentor select chip design start-ups and engineers in India. Such initiatives will provide start-ups with opportunities to work with high-growth-potential small businesses and potentially reshape semiconductor supply chains in the future.

Moreover since the onset of the pandemic automotive- and other electronics-goods manufacturers have witnessed a huge impact on their sales due to the semiconductor crunch. But unlike global players like Ford and BMW which have partnered with chip companies to streamline their supply Indian industry players have lagged behind. A partnership at that level can significantly boost the ecosystem and simultaneously open funding opportunities for fabless chip start-ups in India. But chip design start-ups cannot rely solely on governments and corporates to grow their market and business. Other than designing the chip they should also strive hard to stay relevant feels Saankhya’s Mallapur. “In order to win business in other countries one needs to have a marketing team that is based locally and constantly in touch with the customer during the gestation period. Continuous interaction is essential to ensure the product remains current after development” he adds.

Hopefully with support pouring in from various quarters India’s design engineers and fabless start-ups will succeed in the future and there won’t be ventures like Ecvinox and NeuBionix that folded up due to a lack of funding.

WEST MILTON — Cars and trucks of all makes models and years will be on display in downtown West Milton on Saturday Sept. 17 during the 14th annual West Milton Rotary Cruise-In.

“We usually just shut down the road at 571” Cruise-In organizer Brian Tomlinson said. “We block the road off and then line all the cars up through there.”

“We block off every side street that we can” he said.

The Cruise-In will run from 4 to 8 p.m. and will be held at the corner of state Route 571 and state Route 48 in West Milton. Admission and registration will be free; food vendors will be available and many downtown businesses will also stay open late during the event.

“There will be food vendors on the street as well as Sour Mugs the bar they have food” Tomlinson said. “Clark’s Pizza usually does a booth but I haven’t confirmed that yet.”

“There will be people lining up there about 1 o’clock” he said. “As long as the weather’s good it’s a great turnout and more of a really relaxed vibe. Just kind of come hang out visit the shops and that kind of thing to get familiar with downtown.”

Registration can be done at the Cruise-In and the Rotary will award dash plaques and trophies in several categories.

“They are going to do a few trophies” Tomlinson said. “There will be a little stand for registration. Once they get in they can walk up to the registration tent at the DJ booth.”

Organizers expect several hundred cars to register for the event.

“We’ve had up to 500 at one time” Tomlinson said. “It really just kind of depends on the weather.”

This year will be the Cruise-In’s 14th consecutive year except for 2020.

“We listed it as 14th annual” Tomlinson said. “In 2020 we didn’t have a show but at that point nobody was having car shows. Last year we had it and we had a great time last year.”

“Each town does it” he said. “Greenville does it the week before we do; the next week after ours is Tipp City and the week after that is New Carlisle.”

The cruise-in is sponsored by the West Milton Rotary with help from Flawless Design and O’Reilly Auto Parts. More information can be found online at www.facebook.com/WestMiltonRotary/ or by calling 937-232-6592.

“It’s all about promoting business in West Milton” Tomlinson said. “The shops will be open. Small town business; that’s what it centers around.”

CLOUD -- If you're seeing what appears to be more toads in your yard this year you're not mistaken. A wet spring and sufficient rainfall this summer have allowed the creatures to breed and grow.

Misi Stine is a master naturalist who is a volunteer instructor for the Minnesota Master Naturalist program. She says if your yard or property has food and shelter then toads are likely.

But Stine says pools of water nearby are critical for toads and frogs to mate and lay their eggs. The tadpoles use those pools to then grow and morph into land creatures...

And as they transition and leave the water for the second half of their life they become terrestrial or land animals. They will do that all at about the same time so oftentimes when you see a bunch of little frogs or toadlets what you're seeing is that group has transitioned to that second stage in life and they're all leaving the water and going out and looking for a place to live.

Stine says last year's drought prevented a lot of those eggs from hatching so it's a natural rebound for the toad and frog populations this year with ample moisture.

Some people worry that toads point to a bigger problem with their yard but Stine says toads are harmless. She says we should co-exist with them because they are part of the ecosystem.

Stine says you don't have to fear the creatures trying to get into your home as the weather cools either. They have other strategies for over-wintering and if they do get into your home she says it is by accident.

The popular event has long been the largest car show in the area and before the coronavirus pandemic as many as 40000 people descended on Belmont Shore annually to check out the cool vehicles.

The pandemic however nixed the event in 2020 and 2021.

But now it’s back and a new promoter Pierside Promotions has even been able to reach out to different car owners according to Heather Kern the new executive director for the Belmont Shore Business Association which sponsors the event. About 400 cars are expected this year organizers said.

“We are excited to see new cars and new vendors” Kern said in an email. “Additionally the event is on 9/11. There will be a synchronized honking of horns at 9:11 a.m. followed by a moment of silence and reflection.”

This year’s event will run from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. but Second Street will close to traffic around 6 a.m. to allow show cars to enter and vendors to set up. The street will reopen at 4 p.m.

“The iconic Belmont Shore Car Show is back!” Matt Peterson partner at Legends Sports Bar and a BSBA board member said. “We are pleased to have over 400 cars and close to 60 unique vendors all on Second Street.

“Come out and enjoy all Belmont Shore has to offer.”

Organizer Pierside Promotions of Huntington Beach is a side business for Pierside Parts a custom parts company.

For the first time in recent memory some car owners will receive awards. The top 50 cars in fact will have placards in their windows as show winners with awards given out at the end of the day said Kim Hole of Pierside Promotions.

The Port of Long Beach and Long Beach Airport are major sponsors of the car show and Pierside Promotions has brought in O’Reilly Auto Parts and KWK Trucking among others. Vendors will set up in the street and pay the BSBA a fee for the privilege of doing so. Efforts have been made to ensure the vendors don’t compete directly with Second Street businesses.

For those who want to show off their cars but didn’t register early there will be day-of registration if there is space and for a $40 fee. For more information go to the BSBA website BelmontShore.org.

Parking is at a premium in the area. The beach parking lots along Ocean Boulevard are the closest options and there is a charge. For those with a will to walk some parking is also available at Marine Stadium and Mother’s Beach.

TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Berkshire Hathaway’s Class B shares is currently Very Positive as 83 hedge funds increased their cumulative holdings of BRK.B stock by an impressive 5.3 million shares in the last quarter.

What Exactly does Berkshire Hathaway Do?

Berkshire is headed by the Oracle of Omaha and undoubtedly it is a combination of several successful businesses. Berkshire invests in and owns a multitude of businesses including insurance energy manufacturing rail transportation and retail. Berkshire also has minority stakes in several companies like Buffett’s favorite Occidental Petroleum (OXY).

Why Does Berkshire Hathaway Have 2 Classes of Shares?

Berkshire initially issued only one stock its Class A shares (BRK.A). These were too pricey and made it difficult for smaller investors to gain exposure to the company. Hence in 1996 Buffett introduced another cheaper stock Class B shares to increase affordability.

Class A stock has a lower float compared to Class B stock and is more expensive. Plus Class A stock commands a higher voting power and is convertible to up to 1500 shares of Class B at the option of the holder.

As of July 26 2022 there are only 599924 shares of Class A as against 1301126370 shares of Class B outstanding.

Is Berkshire Hathaway Class B Stock a Good Investment?

Indeed under the stewardship of Buffett and partner Charlie Munger Berkshire Hathaway has been a good investment for shareholders. Its diversified businesses provide a safeguard during times of economic uncertainty.

Berkshire Hathaway exceeded expectations in its Q2FY22 results. The adjusted earnings of $4.21 per share were exceeded by $0.87 per share. Similarly revenues of $76.18 billion were beaten by $3.67 billion.

Moreover retail investors continue loading up the stock. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investor sentiment is currently Positive on Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares with 2.3% of portfolios tracked by TipRanks increasing their exposure to BRK.B stock during the last 30 days.

In the past year or so life has completely changed for Armie Hammer after a slew of sexual assault allegations by multiple women were laid against him. Now a three-part documentary House of Hammer has torn the lid off the Hammer family but more importantly one of the dynasty’s key figures: the former actor’s great-grandfather Armand Hammer.

Naturally the world has been aghast about the allegations against Armie—including unconfirmed cannibalistic desires—since the news broke in 2021. Before we knew it the story became even more shocking with the endless stream of accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.

In the documentary House of Hammer is set to offer viewers “exclusive access and shocking revelations” that take “viewers inside the Hammer family’s dark power plays”. As per the synopsis the doco will reveal “exclusive revelations from Armie’s aunt Casey Hammer and multiple survivors of Armie’s alleged abuse”.

“The three-part series brings to light the dark secrets—ranging from accusations of violence and abuse to political manipulation and financial fraud—hidden within one of America’s most prominent families” the synopsis continued.

While Armie’s allegations have brought unwanted attention to his family it turns out that he wasn’t the only Hammer member in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Armie’s great-grandfather Armand is known as the oil tycoon who earned the family their enormous net worth but it turns out that not many like the man behind the family name.

Below everything you need to know about Armand Hammer—and why he’s had such an integral role in the Hammer family’s rise to power and fortune.

Who is Armand Hammer?

In a report by Vanity Fair writer Julie Miller explored the history of the Hammer family and discovered where their affluent roots lie. Back in 1919 Dr. Julius Hammer (Armie’s great-great-grandfather) performed an abortion on the wife of a Russian diplomat as Julius was a Russian immigrant living in the Bronx New York. But after his patient died he was sentenced to three-and-a-half to 12 years in Sing Sing Correctional Facility in New York according to Miller.

While Julian was serving time in prison his son Armand chose to leave the family’s medical practice and invest in Allied Drug his father’s side hustle. Over time Armand decided to move closer to their family in the Soviet Union getting married and welcoming his only son Julian who would later become Armie’s grandfather.

Eventually the family relocated to Los Angeles where Armand convinced his then-wife Frances Barrett Tolman to invest her fortune into Occidental Petroleum an oil company that was failing at the time. However once they threw their hat in the ring the company turned around”. In 2022 Occidental Petroleum is worth around US $64 billion as per Barrons. After this Armand began calling himself a “self-made industrialist” and quietly became one of the 20th century’s most powerful men.

Much like the Vanity Fair the documentary House of Hammer includes commentary by a member of the Hammer family Casey who is Armie’s aunt. Now estranged from the family she told the publication that her grandfather Armand was an incredibly controlling man sharing that you would see that side of his personality if “you did anything wrong in front of his friends” including outfit repeating.

“God forbid you did anything wrong in front of his friends. You couldn’t wear the same dress twice to his gala parties. On the outside we had to be the perfect family” she shared adding that even if family wanted to speak with Armand an appointment was necessary.

Aside from his lucrative business dealings Armand was a rampant social climber. Regularly socialising with world leaders he has even been photographed with the Kennedys and the British royal family on multiple occasions. According to Vanity Fair he was also seen as Senator Al Gore Sr.’s “close friend” and even attended US Presidential inaugurations from Franklin D. Roosevelt Ronald Raegan and George H.W. Bush.

“I think he was the most satanic man of the second half of the 20th Century” Neil Lyndon journalist and author of Armand’s biography said in House of Hammer. “In terms of corrupting the political process in terms of controlling people and making them dance his tune there is no comparison. Armand Hammer was the embodiment of sin because he was the embodiment of ruthless ego.”

“It’s pretty scary my family and my grandfather’s issues just in general” Casey told Bustle. “He wanted to win the Nobel Peace Prize. So that’s what he was chasing. So everywhere there’s the museum with Hammer on it. There’s the mausoleum. I used to make jokes that if my grandfather could he’d rename me. He wanted his name everywhere and that was his legacy.”

While Armand’s son Julian was “bright” the tycoon didn’t get along with his son. In 1995 Julian was arrested for murdering a man after a dispute over gambling debts. In case you doubted the family’s fortune and the power it held Armand reportedly sent $50000 USD in cash to a lawyer in Los Angeles to deal with the situation and the charges were quickly dropped.

As for where Armand would spend the family fortune the businessman handed over a decent amount of cash to create a cultural centre called the Hammer Museum as well as Holmby Park and the Armand Hammer Golf Course in Los Angeles.

What happened after Armand Hammer’s death?

In 1990 Armand died of bone marrow cancer at the age of 92 in Los Angeles and was buried in the family plot at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery which is coincidentally across the street from his Occidental Petroleum building.

Where did the name ‘Armand Hammer’ come from?

According to Edward Jay Epstein author of the biography Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer he wrote that Armand’s name has a much more significant meaning than you’d think.

In the book it is explained that Armand’s father bragged to his friends about naming his son after the arm-and-hammer insignia. Say the words ‘arm’ ‘and’ ‘hammer’ out loud and you’ll hear the name of the man himself. In fact years after Armand’s father announced the connection between his name and the insignia the symbol became an everlasting symbol on his yacht.

As a sheer coincidence the company Church & Dwight developed the famous Arm & Hammer brand of baking soda in 1876 around 30 years before Armand was even born. Whether his father was inspired by the brand is up for debate but given that the family has such a strong lineage it’s no surprise that they wanted to turn the hammer-wielding symbol into a name.

What is the Hammer family’s net worth?

As we know the Hammer family has been a prolific force in the business world leading them to build a significant fortune over the years. According to Vanity Fair Armand’s estimated net worth was around USD $180 million and a battle for Armand’s estate began. It was reported that Armand’s family were left with USD $40 million and Armie’s father Michael was left the company while his only son Julian and his step-granddaughter Jan were cut out of his will completely.

Now the Hammer family’s estimated wealth is rumoured to have decreased due to a bevy of bad investments with Armie’s net worth made from his acting career also falling after the allegations saw a rapid decline in his fame.

""We have a complex painful common past and it has at times prevented us from looking at the future"" Macron said standing alongside Tebboune.

For Algiers the objective of the three-day visit was to “open up new perspectives for partnership and cooperation with France"".

Things turned sour between the two in 2021 after comments made by Macron in which he suggested Algerian national identity did not exist before French rule and accused Algeria's leaders of rewriting the history of the independence struggle based on a hatred of France.

""Algeria the EU's third-largest gas supplier is looking to capitalise on the energy crisis by locking in more European investment for its future revenue safety net""

The comments unsurprisingly provoked a storm in Algeria where the ruling elite is still dominated by the generation that fought for independence from France after 132 years of colonial rule and where that struggle continues to shape national identity.

In reaction Algeria withdrew its ambassador for consultations and closed its airspace to French planes complicating the French military mission in the Sahel.

Tensions were then further exacerbated when France decided to slash the number of visas issued in North Africa because governments in the Maghreb had refused to take back migrants expelled from France.

The conclusion of August’s visit which Tebboune hailed as “excellent and very successful” came with a raft of accords that the Élysée hopes will smooth ties with the North African nation a major gas and oil supplier to Europe and a key regional military player.

While the nations agreed to cooperate on gas and hydrogen development and medical research ease visa restrictions and create a joint commission to examine archives from the colonial period an official apology for France’s historic crimes in Algeria shows no sign of materialising any time soon.

RELATED How Algeria is emerging as Europe's energy partner of choice Analysis

A change in tone

Due to the Russian-Ukraine war and the steady rise in illegal migration across the Mediterranean Algeria and its gas have taken on greater importance for Europe while it navigates its worsening energy crisis.

The timing has proven opportune for Algeria the EU’s third-largest gas supplier which is looking to capitalise on the crises by locking in more European investment for its future revenue safety net having already increased its gas supplies to the continent mainly via its pipelines to Italy and Spain.

In July this year Algerian group Sonatrach signed a $4 billion gas deal with US group Occidental Petroleum Italian company Eni and French giant Total for the Berkine field in the country's southeast.

Last month meanwhile Sonotrach made a new oil discovery in the Adrar province with an estimated volume of 151 million barrels which could offset concerns that Algeria lacks the means to meet Europe’s increased gas demands.

But despite Italy and Spain being more reliant on Algeria for gas compared to France things have not been plain sailing for old acquaintances over the last few months.

After Spain relented on its traditional neutral position on the Western Sahara issue by backing Rabat Algiers proceeded to suspend the Treaty of Friendship in place since 2002 and block trade with Spain.

The crisis couldn't have come at a worse time for Spain owing to the region’s gas crisis and Sonatrach’s decision thereafter to revise the prices of its long-term contracts with the Spaniards.

""From the United States to Russia there are several Western chairs at the Algerian negotiating table and each wants their voice to ring loudest""

The economic repercussions of the crisis earned Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and his government strong internal criticism and in June a parliamentary motion was voted on by the political class urging the government to return to a position of neutrality in the Sahrawi dossier and to restore normal relations with Algeria.

Despite the soured relations which Spain is looking to mend Algeria has stated that it will respect its contractual obligations with Spain having once been its leading gas supplier.

But it has since then given priority to Italy for increased gas production thanks to the productive visits of Italian officials in recent months.

Competing for dominance at the table

From the United States to Russia there are several Western chairs at the Algerian negotiating table and each wants their voice to ring loudest.

Macron and his 90-person entourage which included the French finance minister interior minister and CEO of the French utility company Engie had a productive visit for the most part arguably arousing as much hope moving forward as that of Jacques Chirac’s visit in 2003.

However smiling photo ops and carefully chosen language can only go so far regarding long-term commitments and navigating the same sensitivities that have often provoked a breakdown of relations when mishandled.

It was only a few months after Chirac’s visit that France adopted a law glorifying colonisation rendering Chirac’s efforts at reconciliation as the first state visit by a French president since independence insincere.

Tebboune and Macron have pledged that the process of consolidating their bilateral relationship will be ""irreversible"" but the signing of the Algiers Declaration to conclude the presidential visit can only inspire hope rather than action for now when it comes to aspects such as political dialogue history memory and above all the contentious issue of accountability.

France also has to contend with Algeria’s seasoned partnerships with countries like Russia and China and increasingly Turkey which was on the receiving end of accusations from Macron that it is pushing an influential neo-colonial and imperialist agenda that paints France as the “enemy” by using France’s colonial past in Algeria to “manipulate” history for its gain.

Ankara blasted Macron’s comments as “unacceptable” and will most likely make some reference to it when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visits Algeria in due course following a closed-door meeting with Algerian Prime Minister Ayman Ben Abderrahmane last month in which the Libyan conflict the energy file and additional Turkish economic interests in Algeria would have been raised.

""For now Algeria will continue to host heads of state and hone in on its bilateral relations by filtering out those who are useful in the background as allies from those with political capital it can actively engage with""

France knows its influence in the region has been waning. Paris would have duly noted Algeria’s public choice of English instead of French during Macron’s trip as the latest signal the government wants to phase out French as one of its main languages of officialdom and open up the country to more opportunities with the Anglophone world.

With the previously cancelled visit from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly on the cards again and the Arab League convening in the capital at the end of the year Algeria is navigating the international arena with a sense of urgency in ensuring it remains a key regional player with its current services recognised and its potential entertained particularly when it comes to neighbouring Libya and the turbulent Sahel.

A cosier relationship with the EU and the US would be in the latter’s interest as they seek to better offset the consequences of Algeria’s ever-strengthening ties with Moscow with both parties agreeing to joint military exercises in November and Algiers’ close economic partnership with Beijing which also includes defence contracts.

For now Algeria will continue to host heads of state and hone in on its bilateral relations by filtering out those who are useful in the background as allies from those with political capital it can actively engage with in furthering its diplomatic and economic ambitions.

Those desiring greater allegiance with Algiers for its stable energy production need to treat the country as its own entity that is not simply a convenient alternative to Morocco when Rabat cannot meet the West’s demands qualities that if played right by both parties can further the national interests for all involved.

Virginia Tech,"You're not seeing double– Old Dominion managed to upset Virginia Tech in Norfolk again.

Selling out a football game doesn't happen often at Old Dominion. When it does there's a big-time opponent in town. In this instance it was a big time regional rival the Virginia Tech Hokies.

The promise of another upset like the Monarchs pulled off in 2018 brought people out in droves and filled up a new-look S. B. Ballard Stadium. ODU was playing their first game as a member of the Sun Belt Conference after a few years as an independent.

Upset In Norfolk!

A House Divided

In Thursday night's Backyard Brawl visiting West Virginia brought a ton of fans. But never have I seen such away fan dominance as I have in this game; Virginia Tech faithful matched Old Dominion home fans evenly.

In most cases they made their presence more known. Hokie fans were disruptive on big downs and in between plays unlike the home fans. In big moments ODU fans were loud but there was dead air between plays and on big downs far too often.

Somehow Virginia Tech got their hands on half the entire end zone bleacher section.

Before settling into the stadium ODU puts on a fan fest on campus just next to the stadium (at the mall? quad?). The band puts on a show ODU's terrific mascot Big Blue mingles and the football team makes their grand entrance. This is about as fanfare-ish schools this size get so if you're headed to Norfolk check this out.

ODU football doesn't offer terribly much in terms of traditions though they do offer one quirky one of note. Heading out of halftime the crowd chants along to ""Ice Cream and Cake"" complete with a coordinated dance. You'll also get to see a light show with new LED stadium lights.

Old Dominion 20 Virginia Tech 17

This game was flat-out wonky. New Hokies starting QB Grant Wells threw four (4!!!) interceptions the field goal snapper sent one 40 yards over the head of the holder (which was scooped and scored by ODU) and the second half was penalties galore.

The Monarchs had a grand total of two red zone drives– one of which ended in a field goal down 17-10 and the other the game-winning touchdown. Otherwise the offense was ineffective.

Both QBs finished with abysmal stat lines and consistently missed opportunities. Receivers dropped wide-open touchdowns. There were far more delay of game penalties than any game should ever have.

To top it off the Virginia Tech press box coaches got stuck in the stadium elevator extending halftime for 13 entire minutes.

Utter chaos.

Just how I like it.

Game Day Grades

Stadium: B. The old S. B. Ballard Stadium had unique curved stands. Those are since gone and nearly a brand-new stadium stands in its place. Sometimes the high school aluminum stands don't work in college but it works here. A pretty nice stadium albeit fairly nondescript.

Tradition: D-. The fans do a quirky dance coming out of halftime and ODU has a rich football history in the 1930s and 1940s. Between then and 2018 though there's not much to write home about.

Atmosphere: C+. When ODU was rolling the stadium was loud. However in between plays the student section was almost nonexistent and far from disruptive.

Tailgating: C+. ODU certainly isn't LSU. It's a smaller football presence so what can you expect? The tailgating right around the stadium was solid and a couple parking lots had partiers. That's about it.

Fans: B+. The fans absolutely showed up including close to 10000 ODU students. They were kind and friendly although the lulls between plays was a minus.

Extracurriculars: C. There's some restaurants and stores around campus but I don't view Norfolk as a destination city. Maybe I'm wrong or just don't know enough people who are excited about visiting.

NORFOLK Va. — As Norfolk State University and Old Dominion University students returned to the classroom after tragedy struck this weekend campus police want to ensure parents they take safety very seriously.

Early Sunday morning Norfolk police said someone shot seven people at a house party on Killam Avenue.

Zabre Miller 25 and Angie McKnight 19 died. Police have not made any arrests at this point.

Education and fun go hand-in-hand to Old Dominion University Police Chief Garrett Shelton.

""We just do everything we can to keep them safe"" he said.

But for some Norfolk State University students a fun night out turned deadly.

McKnight was a second-year pre-nursing major. NSU said on social media other students were involved in the shooting calling them innocent bystanders.

""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family"" said NSU Police Chief Brian Covington.

He said although the shooting happened closer to ODU’s campus their students were involved and they take the safety of their students very seriously.

""Safety is our primary objective for our students here on-campus and off-campus"" Covington said.

Over at ODU Chief Shelton agrees. He said once school starts they increase police presence especially on weekend evenings.

One thing that’s in place that he said more people can utilize is their ""party safe ability"" meaning people living off-campus can register their party with ODU police.

He said some people may be skeptical of telling police exactly where their party is in case people are doing things they shouldn't be like underage drinking; however he said they don't come to get anyone in trouble.

ODU police make direct contact with the hosts so the hosts have a direct line to an officer if things get out of control.

""It’s a give and take. It’s a trust that we’re not going to come close your party down but we’re there to help you if things get out of hand"" Shelton said.

He also noted their on-campus ride-share program 2700 cameras in the area and a virtual buddy system called ""Lift Safe.""

Over at NSU Covington said students have access to a distress call app called ""Everbridge.""

As the school year is just getting started Shelton said he doesn’t think this is an indication of how the rest of the year will go.

And as his latest major hire signals that drive is as intense as ever.





Alex Lubar has joined the network as global president and chief operating officer. Alex joins from McCann Worldgroup where he has worked for just over a decade most recently as president at McCann North America.





This position is a new one for the network and will see Alex work with Marty to proactively pursue opportunity strengthen the network and help clients navigate a turbulent economic environment.





“I've created a new role someone who will work right beside me helping us grow existing clients but also looking for new opportunities for DDB in a world that is still going to be very challenging over the next few months” says Marty. “ I'm going on the offensive trying to make the most of opportunities where I think others will be a bit more conservative.”





According to Alex the appeal of the role lay in the personal alignment with Marty and his vision as well as the chance to work on the storied DDB brand. “There's a lot of simpatico between Marty's approach to leadership and my own” he says. “He very much believes in building strong teams and having strong teams around him. He puts product at the centre of everything that he supports. We get on very very well. Then when you actually turn and look at the organisation DDB just has a phenomenal history of creativity over multiple decades. An opportunity like this doesn't come up very often. So when Marty presented it to me I jumped straight in.”





Marty has been geeing up his international leadership eager that the network sees opportunity and optimism instead of succumbing to uncertainty. The creation of a major role for a high profile hire like Alex is part of that swashbuckling attitude.





“I've been around long enough that I've been through tough economic times before and I think you learn from that. My experience is that the agencies that are confident and hold a proactive point of view can actually really help clients navigate tough times” says Marty who adds that getting nervous or shrinking back can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. “So the message to my team when I got them together in New York was ‘I'd like DDB to be acting with confidence and swagger when we talk to clients about opportunities and challenges’.”





Bundled into that sense of ambition and gutsiness is DDB’s embrace of growth areas beyond the traditional. Marty mentions influencer marketing expertise in emerging social platforms as the half life dwindles data and of course gaming. DDB FTW (For the Win) the network’s specialist gaming agency brand has given the whole network a power up in this space. As an agency strongly associated with traditional creative media Marty says it’s important to both look to the future and be seen to be looking to the future.





Alex is also going to be pivotal in helping strengthen ties between agencies in the network and knitting together capabilities - new and traditional - and says he is keen to enable the ‘polymaths’ who can spot opportunities for cross pollination.





Unlike the early days of the covid-19 pandemic where markets were facing more or less the same issues the current economic challenge is going to present a much more patchwork set of problems and opportunities. That will require even greater collaboration between markets whether in the form of sharing talent or sharing knowledge via platforms like DDB’s central hub ‘The Brain’.





“I think that the economic challenges we're facing right now are very idiosyncratic based on market or industry. So if we can take some of the learnings that we have from our different markets and apply them to other markets that can be very valuable. In fact if you think specifically about the kinds of industries that are highly affected by an economic downturn or economic pressures or that are super local - so telco businesses and retail businesses - we've got a lot of best in class institutional knowledge that exists within markets which can be shared with another market. There's often not as much of that as there could be and I think that that's how you can get a lot of value out of the global network.”





From a personnel perspective Marty believes this approach can also help minimise headcount reduction so busy offices can draw resources from markets going through a slow patch. It also means that the network can reduce over-reliance on freelancers and focus on building culture and a defined DDB product.





“I personally want to reduce our reliance on freelance and actually use our network more because again I want DDB trained creatives that understand our culture to be supporting other agencies rather than strangers who are hit and miss” says Marty who shares that he is currently running an experiment funded out of the corporate team which will see the network host roaming creative talent that can sub in as ‘freelancers’ for the network.





Talking of culture something that both Alex and Marty are aligned on is the strength of the DDB agency brand. Over the past two years Marty has been forging stronger relationships between DDB and the other Omnicom agencies in the holding company in order to more flexibly respond to the needs of particular clients and projects. However they are keen to ensure the rich DDB brand and culture remains at the forefront.





“The way DDB works with other sister agencies and Omnicom is really important. We've got a brilliant relationship with the wider Omnicom group but I want to keep driving that further. The advantage of Omnicom is that we've got strong brands that come together as a holding company whereas [with] some of our competitors I think it's all about the holding company; they don't care as much about the brands” says Marty “How we work with the media agencies and the precision marketing agencies and the PR agencies and the brand consulting group is going to be the key point of difference for us going forward. That's something Alex and I will be really championing - to make sure we can deliver the best-in-class expertise from Omnicom for all clients DDB is working with. That’s a huge focus and it opens up enormous opportunity.”





Indeed the strength of the DDB brand is a key part of what has attracted Alex to the role. In 2021 the network launched a new positioning ‘Unexpected Works’ which underlined the network’s creative reputation and married it with a focus on effectiveness. It also started implementing its four freedoms cultural philosophy.





“I think the thing that's most impressive is how consistent attitudinally DDB is around the globe” says Alex. He enthuses about the strength of the various markets around the world noting that while some networks tend to over-focus on North America or Europe DDB has a strong presence in markets like India Singapore Brazil (and across the Latin American region) and Australia. Alex suspects that the strong culture and brand have done a lot to pull the global network together ensuring the regions are pulling in the same direction. “It is truly a joined up philosophy that everybody buys into. I think sometimes our industry doesn't appreciate how difficult it is to truly be global and also be great on the ground in local markets. And DDB does that in spades.”





And as Alex plunges into the new role he foresees an intense few weeks or months ahead as he gets to know that culture and the people around the world who bring it to life.





“Listening is essential especially when you first arrive at a job - and a job of this magnitude. I think a lot of the early stage will be spent listening to our clients listening to our people and listening to the nuances in the different markets so that I have a real understanding of where there is great strength and where there is opportunity to do more. I think that'll be a big focus and it'll require travelling much of the world I imagine” he says. “But I'm looking forward to that.”

She has left the start-up to join the Interpublic Group media agency and now sits on Initiative’s senior leadership team.

Her main responsibilities include acting as “a bridge” between IPG agencies Initiative and Reprise upskilling agency staff and bringing people of different capabilities into the business.

She reports in to both Sharon Dillon the managing director of Initiative and Chloe Hawking the CEO of Reprise.

Bicycle first launched on 1 June 2021 with co-founders; Henry Daglish former CEO and founder of Bountiful Cow Pedro Avery former CEO of Havas Media Group and Graeme Douglas former co-founder and chief strategy officer at Bountiful Cow.

The agency was founded as a media experience design agency and Ogúndèkó’s role there was as co-founder and chief digital officer in charge of integrating digital and data thinking into the agency.

In May 2022 Bicycle launched an international division after winning Bitpanda’s multimillion pound media account.

In an interview with New Digital Age she said that being part of the founding team of Bicycle was “an absolute dream” and that it wanted to reimagine what media means for businesses and how to fully integrate audiences across platforms without silos or fragmentation.

She is no longer featured on the Bicycle website.

The program to be called Kickstart@OMG will provide successful applicants with all the training they require to successfully change occupations and start the journey towards building a fulfilling long-term career in media.

OMG anticipates applicants will have a range of diverse backgrounds coming from areas such as finance real estate auditing and customer service.

The positions initially offered as part of the Kickstart@OMG program are all full-time paid positions offering a competitive salary designed to allow most applicants to change careers mid-stream.

Omnicom Media Group CEO Peter Horgan said of the new program: “The media agency industry offers purposeful careers to those looking for the opportunity to make a real difference influence people business and the communities we live in.

“This new OMG initiative is all about welcoming people currently working in other industries to our industry letting them know about the opportunities on offer and giving them all the support they need to get started.”

The recruitment drive started on Thursday 1st September with advertising for the program to appear across a broad range of channels.

It’s hoped that participants in the program will have a similar experience to Lucy Woodward a planning manager at OMG media agency Foundation: “I made the switch from audit to media five years ago and haven’t looked back.

“I love the diversity and creativity in my role which has been made even more interesting with the variety of clients co-workers & partners I’ve met along the way. I was surprised how many of my skills were transferrable and valued in media so it felt like I wasn’t starting over” she added.

Kickstart@OMG will be headed up by Alanna Bowman a former senior investment manager at PHD Sydney the program will combine both theoretical learning presented by OMG specialists as well practical training on dedicated client teams like Telstra Suncorp Coles Vic Gov Unilever VW Asahi and ANZ Bank.

Participants will have the opportunity to specialise in one of many areas such as programmatic media investment or media planning.

Bowman said: “There are so many people who start on a career path and after a few years realise they are unhappy. They are looking for a change but the prospect of starting over in a new field can be overwhelming.

“Kickstart@OMG has been designed to provide support training and guidance to these people as they embark on their journey into Media. My hope is that media professionals will hear about Kickstart@OMG and recommend it to friends and family” she added.

Applications will close on Sunday 2nd October with the program kicking off in early November."

Raimondo on Tuesday unveiled a strategy for the Commerce Department’s disbursal of $50 billion that Congress approved to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips saying she expected the first money to flow in the spring of 2023.

“With this funding we are going to make sure that the United States is never again in a position where our national security interests are compromised or key industries are immobilized due to our inability to produce essential semiconductors here at home” Raimondo said at a White House news briefing.

A severe shortage of chips because of disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic drove up prices of cars and household goods in the past year contributing to inflation that is running at its fastest pace in about 40 years.

Raimondo said the U.S. uses 25 percent of the world’s cutting-edge chips but doesn’t make any of them. Advanced chips are mostly made in Taiwan but China is ramping up design and production of such chips as well.

President Joe Biden signed into law in early August a bill that would provide the $50 billion of federal funding to private companies to boost domestic design research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.

The administration is touting the program as a major job creator in battleground states in the November mid-term elections.

Raimondo said the program would create “tens of thousands of good paying manufacturing jobs and more than 100000 construction jobs” that would expand opportunities for groups that have historically “not had a chance to participate in this industry” including women people of color veterans and those living in rural areas.

Intel Micron and other chip makers have announced plans to open domestic manufacturing plants in anticipation of the federal program. Biden plans to participate at a groundbreaking event for an Intel plant in Ohio on Friday. Rep. Tim Ryan a Democrat in a close race to flip a Ohio Senate seat said he will also attend. Intel says it will spend $20 billion to build two manufacturing plants in Ohio.

“We’re finally bringing home jobs that have been overseas for a while” Biden said at a cabinet meeting Tuesday.

The Commerce Department’s strategy calls for balancing “urgent needs in the semiconductor industry with long term strategic goals.”

The department will spend about $39 billion on domestic chip manufacturing according to the strategy. About $28 billion of that will be in the form of manufacturing incentives for U.S. production of “bleeding edge logic and memory chips that require the most sophisticated processes available” Raimondo said adding that $10 billion would go toward new manufacturing capacity for mature or current generation chips.

Another $11 billion would go toward research and development programs including the creation of a National Semiconductor Technology Center at the department she said. The department also released an executive summary of the strategy.

Raimondo said the department would call for applications from companies starting about February 2023 and expects to announce awards in early spring. The first set of grants are likely to be for smaller projects and the bigger ones may come later she said.

Raimondo pledged close department scrutiny of how the money is used and plans to hire 50 legal and technical experts to oversee the spending.

Some lawmakers and other critics call the program a handout to tech companies that moved chip manufacturing outside the U.S. during the last two decades and are now getting taxpayer dollars to shift it back.

“This is not a blank check for companies” Raimondo said. “This is not for them to pad their bottom line.”

Companies taking the federal funds cannot use the money for stock buybacks to boost profits or shift manufacturing overseas especially to China for a period of 10 years she said.

Each application and approval will be negotiated “one deal at a time and [the department will be] really putting the screws to these companies to prove to us …that the money is absolutely necessary to make these investments” Raimondo said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9iaWRlbi10ZWNoLWNoaXBzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden Administration Releases Plan for $50 Billion Investment in Chips (Published 2022),"WASHINGTON — The Department of Commerce on Tuesday unveiled its plan for dispensing $50 billion aimed at building up the domestic semiconductor industry and countering China in what is expected to be the biggest U.S. government effort in decades to shape a strategic industry.

About $28 billion of the so-called CHIPS for America Fund is expected to go toward grants and loans to help build facilities for making assembling and packaging some of the world’s more advanced chips.

Another $10 billion will be devoted to expanding manufacturing for older generations of technology used in cars and communications technology as well as specialty technologies and other industry suppliers while $11 billion will go toward research and development initiatives related to the industry.

Some have dubbed it Silicon Alley—or more aptly Silicon Prairie. And if you haven’t already bought land for development along the 30-mile stretch of U.S. 75 north of McKinney to Sherman you’re facing skyrocketed land prices.

In a tale that’s similar to what happened with the suburbs of Plano Frisco and Richardson some 20 to 30 years ago the once sleepy towns of Anna Melissa Sherman and Van Alstyne are becoming the new hotbed for the region’s growth with the promise of an estimated 4500 jobs coming to the area within the next five years.

Last November Texas Instruments announced that it would build a $30 billion 4.7-million-square-foot semiconductor fabrication plant in Sherman—the largest electronic production facility in the state and among the biggest manufacturing facilities in the country. Fending off a bid to bring the plant to Singapore the town with a population of 44873 located about 60 miles north of Dallas landed its big fish bringing with it a projected 3000 jobs that will pay an average of $55000 per year. TI broke ground on the first two phases of the project in May and is expected to begin delivering products from its Sherman plants by 2025.

Portfolio Major Projects at a Glance Texas Instruments The hometown icon is planning four 300-millimeter semiconductor wafer fabrication plants in Sherman. The new manufacturing facilities will produce millions of analog and embedded processing chips that go into electronics. GlobiTech A subsidiary of Taiwan-based Global Wafers Co. GlobiTech was founded by three former TI employees. The new $5 billion Sherman facility will create 1500 jobs and represents the first new silicon wafer facility to open in the United States in two decades. Anacapri The Anacapri housing development in Anna located west of Anna High School is a lagoon-anchored 1239-home development that will cost approximately $800 million. In addition to the crystal lagoon it will include two beaches—one that is open to the public—as a tourist draw for the area.

Just about a month later in June global semiconductor manufacturer GlobiTech awarded its $5 billion 1500-job project to Sherman too. To lure GlobiTech’s semiconductor plant the Sherman Economic Development Corp. offered $20 million in cash payments and the sale of nearly 150 acres of land worth more than an estimated $14.4 million. The Texas Enterprise Fund added an additional $15 million grant to the incentive package. Meanwhile the city of Sherman Grayson County and Grayson College offered tax incentives and discounted utilities. The global semiconductor manufacturer was also considering sites in Ohio and South Korea before choosing to make North Texas its permanent home.

“These are once-in-a-lifetime projects for our region” says Kent Sharp president of the Sherman Economic Development Corp. “You work your entire career in economic development with the hopes of being part of a deal that has a ‘B’ in front of it—and we’ve landed two in the past year.”

Rooftops and Residents

Homebuilders have taken notice of the flurry of semiconductor projects coming soon to Sherman—and it is having a ripple effect for towns along the Highway 75 corridor. “Anna is one of the fastest-growing towns in North Texas and we’re proud to be a part of the positive growth story there” said Mehrdad Moayedi president and CEO of Farmers Branch-based Centurion American when he broke ground on the Villages of Hurricane Creek development earlier this year. Phase one of the project is underway and in total will include 1794 single-family lots 400 multifamily units and 60000 square feet of new commercial development.

Anacapri by Megatel is another housing project that broke ground earlier this year. Announced in October 2021 the $800 million development includes 1239 single-family homes 600 multifamily units and a 2.3-acre crystal lagoon. Megatel has sold every phase one lot in the forthcoming development.

Blue Lagoon Anna is the latest city in North Texas to join the lagoon craze with the new Anacapri development.

National homebuilders are getting in on the action too. Construction is set to commence later this year on Bloomfield Homes’ Crystal Park in Anna which includes 981 single-family lots and 82 acres of mixed-use. D.R. Horton plans 942 single-family lots and 600 multifamily units at its new The Woods at Lindsey Place development in Anna. And Meritage Homes will add 456 homes at Wolf Creek Farms The Quarry at Stoneridge and Bryant Farms in Melissa.

It all adds up to more residents making the Highway 75 corridor home. According to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau population estimates Melissa has seen 21.8 percent population growth since 2020 growing from 13941 to an estimated 16983. For Anna its population is up 19.5 percent from 16935 to 20243. Sherman has added more than 6000 residents in the last two years seeing its population balloon from 38521 at the 2010 census to its current population estimate of 44873.

Though its neighbors to the south McKinney and Frisco have seen double-digit drops in homebuilding permits in the first half of 2022 Anna’s residential permits are up 15 percent for 635 permits this year. Meanwhile Melissa saw a 2 percent gain at mid-year over a year ago with 522 total permits. Sherman’s housing permits have more than doubled from 154 in June of 2021 to 316 permits at the halfway point of 2022.

And there are few signs of slowing says Anna’s economic development director Joey Grisham. As Texas Instruments and GlobiTech complete their initial phases in the coming years he expects to see spinoff companies suppliers and customers from these two giants move to the area similar to what happened with TI in Dallas and Richardson in decades prior.

“My phone has been ringing off the hook with interest” Grisham says. “It’s definitely an exciting time for the Dallas-Fort Worth region as a whole—and there’s no better time than now to do business in north Collin County.”"

ORCL,Oracle Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3Mub3JhY2xlLmNvbS9kaXZlcnNpdHktaW5jbHVzaW9uL3Bvc3QvbnVydHVyaW5nLXRydXN0LWFuZC1pbmNsdXNpb24tYS1xYS13aXRoLW9yYWNsZS1jaW8tamFlLWV2YW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nurturing trust and inclusion: A Q&A with Oracle CIO Jae Evans,"I recently had an opportunity to chat with one of Oracle’s top executives Chief Information Officer Jae Evans who was one of only 50 executives just named to the prestigious Forbes CIO Next: 2022. Jae is a huge champion of diversity and inclusion at Oracle and is a sponsor of several internal groups focused on empowering and including people of diverse backgrounds and talents at Oracle including the Executive Diversity Council which is led by our CEO Safra Catz.

Below is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation which touched on her leadership values the importance of mentoring being intentional about removing bias as a barrier to success and career advancement and the importance of developing trust.

Traci:

Jae you have had an incredibly long journey with D&I [diversity and inclusion] predating your arrival at Oracle where you’re a sponsor of a number of Employee Resource Groups or ERGs. Can you share what next steps can be taken as you think about hiring diverse talent and the process at the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) group you support?

Jae:

We’ve been doing quite a bit at OCI to help ensure a diverse and inclusive hiring process in partnership with recruiting focusing on how we write our job descriptions along with having a strong culture of behavioral-based interviewing based on specific job competencies and OCI values to minimize bias and to ensure we make data-driven hiring decisions. We also have a global standardized interview process so that all candidates no matter their background are evaluated the same way. We also partner with professional organizations like Grace Hopper the Society of Hispanic Engineers AfroTech and the National Society of Black Engineers to cite some examples and we've increased our diverse representation in our pipeline and in building relationships with our URM [underrepresented minority] communities.

Oracle CIO Jae Evans

We've been intentional with diversity recruiting for campus pipelines for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions. We also have an executive partnership with Morgan State University. We sponsor non-traditional pipelines including coding schools for women and gender diverse such as Ada Academy return to work programs such as Oracle Career Relaunch which rolled out globally this year and military veteran bridge programs. So I'm proud of these programs on OCI’s progress and what we've put in place considering we spend a lot of time seeking highly skilled talent in this competitive market.

Traci:

We all have biases. Let's just be real. Myself 14 years in D&I—we all have biases. It's all about how do we mitigate bias. Have you ever in your own experience experienced any forms of unconscious bias? And if you have how did you deal with it? How'd you manage it?

Jae:

I was talking to a colleague who got married recently and I congratulated her and her husband and she corrected me and said it was her wife. It was an assumption that I made wrongly and I was apologetic. And I learned from that and now I reference significant other or I say partner which is not associated with gender. So I too also can have unconscious biases but I try to learn from them.

For my part I've been often mistakenly referenced as Mr. Jae Evans. And one time when I met a supplier for the first time he blurted out to me that as a person who heads up infrastructure engineering and operations he thought I was a white male.

I responded to him ""Fortunately I'm a female and glad I'm different than you expected because it takes a lot to do this role and be in this role and be successful at it."" That was my way of trying to address the fact that I am not a male. I am a female and I am not Caucasian I am Asian. I think constant learning is the most important thing for myself and for others.

Traci:

At your previous employer you started a mentor circle which you’ve brought to Oracle. Can you explain why that was important to bring here to Oracle?

Jae:

The specific mentoring circle that I did at my previous company was with women in technology who were ranked as top performers with high potential. The dilemma was that we kept seeing a lot of middle managers leaving the company. And we were seeing a big gap between middle management and executives.

Among the challenges I was seeing and hearing were things like not being recognized for their work or having someone else take recognition for their work and difficulty having certain types of career and personal development conversations and handling these kinds of situations or knowing how to bring themselves and their ideas to the table without constantly having to feel like they had to be the loudest talker in the room.

So we started having these honest conversations and it wasn't just me giving them advice. It was actually a really collaborative group and because it was a safe place to have those conversations they were able to build the courage to have those conversations and to have those interactions with their managers.

And as a result I started to see that some of them got promoted. Some of them moved to a different area of opportunity. And we started to see this progress versus before when they were like ""Hey I think I want to leave the company because I'm not really happy with what's going on.""

So that happened at the previous company. Then fast-forward here when I came to Oracle I’ve established a mentoring circle of high-performing female leaders .

So we're having these honest conversations here at Oracle and I'm using that information to initiate discussion with my peers along the lines of sponsorship advocacy and action to develop and retain great talent: ""We need to be conscientious about this. Otherwise we're not going to make progress.""

Traci:

My last question is do you have any books or videos on this topic that you can recommend?

Jae:

Leading a team can be challenging especially when you're new to it or when there are a lot of changes taking place and things are moving at a fast pace. And that's when it's actually the most critical time. I was given a book by one of my former managers called The Power of Genuine Leadership: How Authentic Leaders Earn Trust.

You won’t learn how to effectively manage a team just by reading a book but one key element for you to learn is you can’t lead if people won’t follow and the key element to that is building trust. The book references the Authenticity Trust Model which calls out three critical components of authenticity which create trust when applied consistently: communication coaching and respect.

Related to this I had the opportunity to attend the leadership consortium series led by Harvard Business School a few years back. One of the main professors Frances Frei talked about the trust triangle. Just having diverse teams doesn’t mean you will be more productive but if you create conditions of trust and encourages diverse teams to bring their unique perspectives ideas and experiences you can expand the amount of knowledge your team can access which helps with making great decisions. She also has a TED Talk on this.

Traci:

To cope with the challenges that this poses organizations are turning to a growing range of AI-powered tools to supplement their existing security software and the work of their security teams. Today a startup called Cymulate — which has built a platform to help those teams automatically and continuously stress test their networks against potential attacks with simulations and provide guidance on how to improve their systems to ward off real attacks — is announcing a significant round of growth funding after seeing strong demand for its tools.

The startup — founded in Tel Aviv with a second base in New York — has raised $70 million a Series D that it will be using to continue expanding globally and investing in expanding its technology (both organically and potentially through acquisitions).

Today Cymulate’s platform covers both on-premise and cloud networks providing breach and attack simulations for endpoints email and web gateways and more; automated “red teaming”; and a “purple teaming” facility to create and launch different security breach scenarios for organizations that lack the resources to dedicate people to a live red team — in all a “holistic” solution for companies looking to make sure they are getting the most out of the network security architecture that they already have in place in the words of Eyal Wachsman Cymulate’s CEO.

“We are providing our customers with a different approach for how to do cybersecurity and get insights [on] all the products already implemented in a network” he said in an interview. The resulting platform has found particular traction in the current market climate. Although companies continue to invest in their security architecture security teams are also feeling the market squeeze which is impacting IT budgets and sometimes headcount in an industry that was already facing a shortage of expertise. (Cymulate cites figures from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology that estimate a shortfall of 2.72 million security professionals in the workforce globally.)

The idea with Cymulate is that it’s built something that helps organizations get the most out of what they already have. “And at the end we provide our customers the ability to prioritize where they need to invest in terms of closing gaps in their environment” Wachsman said.

The round is being led by One Peak with Susquehanna Growth Equity (SGE) Vertex Ventures Israel Vertex Growth and strategic backer Dell Technologies Capital also participating. (All five also backed Cymulate in its $45 million Series C last year.) Relatively speaking this is a big round for Cymulate doubling its total raised to $141 million and while the startup is not disclosing its valuation I understand from sources that it is around the $500 million mark.

Wachsman noted that the funding is coming on the heels of a big year for the startup (the irony being that the constantly escalating issue of cybersecurity and growing threat landscape spells good news for companies built to combat that). Revenues have doubled although it’s not disclosing any numbers today and the company is now at more than 200 employees and works with some 500 paying customers across the enterprise and mid-market including NTT Telit and Euronext up from 300 customers a year ago.

Wachsman who co-founded the company with Avihai Ben-Yossef and Eyal Gruner said he first thought of the idea of building a platform to continuously test an organization’s threat posture in 2016 after years of working in cybersecurity consulting for other companies. He found that no matter how much effort his customers and outside consultants put into architecting security solutions annually or semi-annually those gains were potentially lost each time a malicious hacker made an unexpected move.

“If the bad guys decided to penetrate the organization they could so we needed to find a different approach” he said. He looked to AI and machine learning for the solution a complement to everything already in the organization to build “a machine that allows you to test your security controls and security posture continuously and on demand and to get the results immediately… one step before the hackers.”

Last year Wachsman described Cymulate’s approach to me as “the largest cybersecurity consulting firm without consultants” but in reality the company does have its own large in-house team of cybersecurity researchers white-hat hackers who are trying to find new holes — new bugs zero days and other vulnerabilities — to develop the intelligence that powers Cymulate’s platform.

These insights are then combined with other assets for example the MITRE ATT&CK framework a knowledge base of threats tactics and techniques used by a number of other cybersecurity services including others building continuous validation services that compete with Cymulate. (Competitors include the likes of FireEye Palo Alto Networks Randori AttackIQ and many more.)

Cymulate’s work comes in the form of network maps that detail a company’s threat profile with technical recommendations for remediation and mitigations as well as an executive summary that can be presented to financial teams and management who might be auditing security spend. It also has built tools for running security checks when integrating any services or IT with third parties for instance in the event of an M&A process or when working in a supply chain.

Today the company focuses on network security which is big enough in itself but also leaves the door open for Cymulate to acquire companies in other areas like application security — or to build that for itself. “This is something on our roadmap” said Wachsman.

If potential M&A leads to more fundraising for Cymulate it helps that the startup is in one of the handful of categories that are going to continue to see a lot of attention from investors.

“Cybersecurity is clearly an area that we think will benefit from the current macroeconomic environment versus maybe some of the more capital-intensive businesses like consumer internet or food delivery” said David Klein a managing partner at One Peak. Within that he added “The best companies [are those] that are mission critical for their customers… Those will continue to attract very good multiples.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaHNlY3VyaXR5L2ZlYXR1cmUvV2hhdC1pcy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is the Future of Cybersecurity?,"Cybersecurity has risen to the top of corporate agendas as businesses continue to grapple with cyber threats associated with the rise in remote work and increase in online commerce driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to research from Gartner 88% of boards now regard cybersecurity as a business risk rather than simply a technical problem for IT.

Heightened concerns over cybersecurity coupled with an ongoing shortage of cybersecurity professionals will also drive changes to cybersecurity strategies and workplace policies in the coming years Gartner predicted including the following:

Below are five cybersecurity trends enterprises must embrace as they move forward from the pandemic.

Cybersecurity trends

Trend 1: Work from anywhere becomes permanent

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the accepted culture at many organizations. The original expectation of people working from home for a matter of weeks has turned into month after month for many. Some organizations have given up office leases and opted for permanent work from anywhere for employees to save money. In other organizations the workforce has demanded to continue working from anywhere part time or full time.

When COVID-19 hit most organizations had to quickly shift their services and apps from on premises to the cloud and this new architecture -- with cloud-based resources and work-from-anywhere workforces -- was meant to be temporary. Functionality was naturally prized instead of security because the main objective was to keep organizations running.

But with organizations making long-term or permanent shifts to work from anywhere security teams need to rethink the ""temporary"" arrangements and do what's needed to update security policies processes and technologies. There will almost certainly be challenges in implementing security controls maintaining visibility into security events and demonstrating compliance with security requirements.

One last element of recalibrating your cybersecurity strategies for remote work: Don't forget to spend some time ensuring that the members of your security team are able to work together well in this new environment as well as interact and communicate with other technology and business teams.

Trend 2: Automate automate automate

Security teams have been in a no-win situation for years. They can't possibly keep up with all the threats that their increasingly large and complex web of computing resources faces. The demand for cybersecurity experts keeps growing and it's about time that organizations accept that it won't be remedied any time soon.

Instead of trying to increase their human resources to accommodate for shortcomings in tools and technologies organizations must increase their reliance on automation. Security technologies that use artificial intelligence and machine learning and that perform constant data analytics on monitored security event data can detect new threats much faster than people can. They can find subtle patterns of malicious activity that a human wouldn't see. Similarly security automation can continuously identify the presence of new software vulnerabilities configuration errors and other problems and ensure that each problem is quickly mitigated.

Increasing the amount of automation and improving the quality of automation technologies reduce the day-to-day burden on the scarce cybersecurity experts. These experts can then spend their time focusing on more strategic matters that could greatly benefit the organization in the long run.

Trend 3: Adopt zero-trust principles

Zero trust is a new name for an old concept: Don't assume that anything or anyone should be trusted. Verify the trustworthiness of each device user service or other entity before granting it access and frequently reverify trustworthiness during access to ensure the entity hasn't been compromised. Give each entity access to only the resources it needs in order to minimize the impact of any violation of trust. Zero-trust principles can reduce the frequency of incidents and the severity of incidents that do occur.

Zero trust is a principle not a security control or technology. It relies on the entire technology infrastructure being designed to check and recheck the identity and security posture of each entity and to continuously monitor the activities involving each entity. Achieving this requires widespread cooperation among security architects and engineers system and network administrators software developers and other technology professionals. Implementation is almost always a phased multiyear effort and that's why there's increasing pressure to start adopting zero-trust principles as soon as possible. This is one time when you should bow to pressure.

Trend 4: Improve response capabilities

It's become painfully obvious that most organizations need to improve their response capabilities. Attacking organizations through ransomware has become an actual business with attackers effectively locking users out of their systems and data and then demanding -- and receiving -- large ransoms to restore access. At the same time these attackers are conducting large data breaches collecting enormous amounts of sensitive data and demanding ransoms to prevent its release or sale.

Organizations need to be prepared to respond to large-scale ransomware incidents and that means incident responders working closely with not just security experts but also system administrators legal counsel public affairs and others to ensure the response goes smoothly and services are restored quickly. Prepare to handle ransom demands before they're made.

Trend 5: Recognize the risks from supply chains

We typically trust what our vendors and service providers give us. The SolarWinds incident illustrated just how risky that trust in our supply chains is. A single company can be successfully infiltrated by a nation-state and that company may provide compromised technology products or services to thousands of other companies. Those companies in turn will not only be compromised themselves but they may expose their own customers' data to the original attackers or provide compromised services to their customers. What started with a single infiltrated company can lead to millions of organizations and individuals being compromised.

There's no easy answer to addressing this. Many aspects of our security strategy and technology need to be improved. What's most important at this time is for organizations to recognize and acknowledge the risks from our supply chains and to demand that we all do better. Whether that means holding vendors accountable for poor security practices that lead to compromises requiring more transparency into vendors' security practices before renewing contracts or adding requirements to new procurements individual organizations can raise awareness of these issues and put pressure on vendors and service providers to do better.",,,,,,

While nothing is ever going to rival “Turtlemania” — the period during the early ’90s in which the pizza-munching reptiles became a global pop culture phenomenon — it’s still a great time to be a TMNT fan.

Recently a fan-made movie found its way onto YouTube which is based on the popular five-issue IDW comic book series “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” (2020). As such fans are hoping this will inspire Paramount to finally get round to an R-rated TMNT movie.

As for movies that are officially in the works Seth Rogen‘s animated reboot was recently given both an official title and release date — Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) will be hitting theaters on August 4 next year. It will be the second theatrical CG animated movie in the franchise with TMNT (2007) being the first.

And earlier this year Paramount Pictures also confirmed that there are a number of other TMNT movies in the works each of which will focus on an iconic villain (Shredder Krang Bebop and Rocksteady no doubt). These films will be heading straight to Paramount+ in 2023.

There is also another live-action TMNT movie in the works. It is being written by SNL writers Colin and Casey Jost and produced by Michael Bay who also served as producer on the last two movies in the series (though the new film is not expected to be a sequel).

The untitled project will be the sixth live-action move in the franchise following Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016).

The gaming side of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise is equally busy. Retro/arcade-style beat ’em up video game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge (2022) is now finally available on all major gaming consoles and has impressed both critically and financially.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (2022) which is a compilation of all the arcade-style video games in the franchise is also available for purchase. And now it looks like the Ninja Turtles are set to return to major consoles next year according to a new report.

Fanbyte has reported that “Toy World” magazine — a leading UK toy trade publication — has hinted towards a brand-new “Triple-A” video game that will feature the beloved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

The magazine mentions that Paramount plans to discuss the game — which is reportedly due out some time next year — at the upcoming “Brand Licensing London” convention which will take place later this month at London ExCel.

Here’s the paragraph in question from this month’s issue of the magazine:

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back with a new look and a new movie. Paramount will be launching an extensive new range of action figures and plans to expand further at the back end of the year. Collectors are being served by nostalgic gaming releases including an already launched new retro themed game: Shredder’s Revenge. Paramount is also planning a remaster of Konami’s The Cowabunga Collection at the end of the year and will launch a brand-new original Triple-A game in 2023.

Wikipedia describes Triple-A/AAA video games as the following:

In the video-game industry AAA is an informal classification used to categorise games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher which typically have higher development and marketing budgets than other tiers of games

Is it possible that this project is an open-world Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game? Given the fact that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles takes place in New York City it would certainly be an ambitious venture and there are many things fans would want from such a video game.

There are already several open-world Spider-Man titles set in the Big Apple though as well as certain entries in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Needless to say taking control of Leonardo Michelangelo Raphael and Donatello (perhaps even Splinter Casey Jones and April O’Neil too) in an open-world Manhattan setting would be a dream come true for fans.

Open-world video games are becoming increasingly more popular with some huge titles on the way such as Hogwarts Legacy (2023) Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (2023) and an untitled Star Wars video game (TBA). A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game along these lines makes too much sense to ignore.

Nothing even remotely concrete has been confirmed as yet though so it’s best to take this news with a pinch of salt. Nevertheless looking at the success the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise is currently enjoying it wouldn’t surprise us if a big-budget video game is in the works.

For now we’ll just have to wait and see if next year brings even more “Turtle Power” to gaming consoles.

PAYX is benefiting from its investor-friendly steps and rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry.

PAYX’s earnings and revenues are anticipated to grow 9.8% and 7.7% respectively in fiscal 2023. Shares of PAYX have gained 6.4% in the past year compared with the 6.2% rise of the industry it belongs to.

Factors That Augur Well

Paychex strives to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the PEO industry. PAYX’s subsidiary Paychex HR Outsourcing is established as a strong strategic fit as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in-house HR. Paychex HR Outsourcing expanded PAYX’s services thus helping it to add to its customer base.

Paychex makes consistent efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. PAYX paid out dividends of $908.7 million $889.4 million and $826.8 million each and repurchased shares worth $155.7 million $171.9 million and $56.9 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively. Such initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence in the stock but also positively impact the earnings per share.

A Key Risk

Paychex’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) stood at 1.25 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 lower than 1.27 recorded at the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Decreasing current ratio does not bode well for Paychex.

Some PayPal customers can now move their cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin from their accounts to external wallets and exchanges.

The online payment giant announced that select customers in the United States will be able to use the service this week and all eligible customers in the US will be able to use the feature in the coming months.

PayPal and its Venmo app are used by hundreds of millions of people all over the world to move money.

The new service means that PayPal customers can also send crypto to other PayPal users in seconds with no fees or network charges.

In October 2020 the company started allowing customers to buy sell and hold Bitcoin Ethereum and Litecoin. However they could not move crypto holdings off its platform - until now.

""This feature has been consistently ranked by users as one of the most requested enhancements since we began offering the purchase of crypto on our platform"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte SVP and general manager of blockchain crypto and digital currencies at PayPal said in a statement.

PayPal has been pushing to include cryptocurrencies in its services.

In March last year PayPal launched a feature that allowed customers to pay with crypto assets across millions of online businesses. It also said earlier this year it was exploring the launch of its own stablecoin which has been dubbed PayPal Coin.

Euronews Next reached out to PayPal asking if it would offer the new feature to users in Europe. The company declined to comment on future plans.

PayPal is not the first digital payment company to transfer crypto assets off its platform. In April Robinhood said 2 million of its “eligible” customers could transfer digital assets off its platform after it activated a crypto wallet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy50cmVuZG1pY3JvLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA1L2JpdGNvaW4tcGF5cGFsLWVtYWlsLW10LXplbGxlLWJhbmstcGF5bWVudC1zY2Ftcy1waGlzaGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank and Payment Scams: Bitcoin PayPal M&T and Zelle,"This week we’ve found three new bank/payment scams making the rounds. Read on for the low-down — as well as how to protect yourself.

Bitcoin PayPal Email Scam

Many email and PayPal users have reported receiving scam emails claiming to be from PayPal in which the user is notified of a large payment having taken place with Bitcoin Exchange — most commonly for the amount of $499.98. See below for an example scam email.

Source: Windows Report

According to reports the emails arrive with a subject line containing an invoice number and the would-be victim’s name. The email itself contains a fake invoice with the bogus details of the fake transaction. Users are then asked to open the embedded link in order to check the details (or download an attachment). However if you do so your computer will likely be injected with a virus. Following this your personal data will be stolen — and potentially locked behind a paywall.



This is a classic ransomware scheme in which the scammers will then demand a payment in order to release the data. Paying the ransom will not lead to regaining your data. Following payment the scammers will simply disappear — meaning you’ve lost your personal information and now your money too!



The best course of action then is prevention. Red flags are: grammatical errors impersonal greetings strange URLs and attachments. None of these will be present in official emails from the major companies. If in doubt contact PayPal directly. Users can also forward suspected scam emails to spoof@paypal.com.



The following is another scam email template:

“Thank You for choosing Paypal for placing your Order BITCOIN.

Your order has been successfully placed.

The Payment will be shown soon within the next 5 to 10 hours on PAYPAL

PRODUCT INFORMATION

Memo Id: CAFV365BNA

Receiving Date: Day After Place The Order.

Price: 457.25 USD

Charge Mode: PAYPAL

If you Wish to Cancel then please feel free to contact our Billing Department as soon as possible.

M&T Bank Phishing Texts

There have also been widespread reports of phishing attempts sent to consumers via SMS text messages posing as M&T Bank. The messages will inform the would-be victim of a transaction or an account security issue as seen in the templates below.



SMS content:

m&t: your card has been charged $92.1 on applepay. login and cancel here {URL} if not you.

m&t bank noticed: we’ve found unusual activity in your account. for your protection we’ve placed a temporary hold to prevent further unauthorized transactions. please visit {URL} to secure your account.

The aim is to make you panic and follow the attached phishing link. This will take you to a malicious webpage designed to harvest your personal information. Don’t fall for it!

Sample phishing page

Zelle Payment Phishing Scam

Not to be outdone other scammers have been using the disguise of the payment platform Zelle in order to carry out phishing attacks. As above it is done via SMS text messages. The messages will inform the would-be victim of a transaction or security issue as seen in the templates below.



SMS content:

zellepay

zelle pay: prior receiving an incoming $650 zelle needs an urgent verification on the debit card attached to your account. we have put a hold on this payment. follow the link for your zelle card verification. {URL} c2022.

Sample phishing page

Needless to say don’t follow the links — you’ll likely end up with your personal information compromised and your money stolen.

FAQs

Copy link to section

What are commodities? Commodities are raw materials (such as iron ore) or agricultural products (such as wheat) that can be bought or sold in the form of futures or options. A broker will execute those trades for you and change a small fee for doing so. What are soft commodities? Soft commodities are agricultural products which are grown as opposed to metals which are mined (these are known as hard commodities). Examples of soft commodities include wheat corn coffee sugar and livestock. What commodities can I trade with PayPal? Barring rare exceptions using your PayPal as a payment method enables you to trade just as wide a range of both soft and hard commodities as you would with other payment methods.

Regulatory bodies enforce position limits for commodities trades to ensure that large institutional investors don’t use their immense resources to try to corner the market on a specific commodity.

I was born in Ireland but grew up in London. I moved to NYC 19 years ago so I'm now a bonafide New Yorker!

Your earliest musical memory.

My mom is a singer so I was born into the industry. I don't remember a time not being surrounded by music.

Your first concert.

My first big concert was seeing U2 at King's Hall in Belfast Northern Ireland. I could see Bono sitting on a flight-case stage left. I was 11.

Your favorite band/musician.

That is an impossible question as I love so many. David Bowie changed my life—his voice his lyrics his creative expression he is without doubt one of the top five artists of all time. A magical ever-changing human whose star always shone brightly but had the ability to remain mysterious until the end. Ye and Jay Z are two geniuses—their music has become the soundtrack to so many pivotal moments in my life. Jay has the ability to make everything look so effortless and Kanye will never do the same thing twice; he is fearless when it comes to making music.

How you get your music these days.

I stream on Apple and Spotify.

Your favorite place to see a concert.

It may seem like an odd choice due to the size of the venue but there is something incredibly special about Madison Square Garden. I have seen some of the greatest shows in that venue and it never gets old.

Your favorite music video.

I cannot choose one as there are just too many. A couple that standout: Childish Gambino's ""This Is America"" takes my breath away every time I watch it; I think it belongs in an art gallery. Kendrick Lamar's ""Humble"" is brilliant and thought provoking. And every video by Radiohead. They are perfection.

Your favorite music-focused TV show and/or podcast.

I prefer movies to TV. I thought Rocketman was spectacular was blown away by Elvis and I think Amy is one of the greatest music documentaries ever made.

A recent project you're proud of.

The ""Flamin' Hot"" Super Bowl campaign for Frito-Lay with Megan Thee Stallion. It was the perfect collaboration between brand creative agency and artist—the commercial is hilarious totally unexpected and never gets old and the 360 elements were a massive story on their own: Megan created an original song that both fans and the critics loved and we launched the accompanying music video on a chip in partnership with Snapchat. It was a true first-of-its-kind all round.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGZhaXJvbmxpbmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcGVwc2ljb3Mtc3VwZXItYm93bC1sdmktaGFsZnRpbWUtc2hvdy13aW5zLWFuLWVtbXktYXdhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo's Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show wins an Emmy Award,"The PepsiCo-sponsored Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special.

Because Pfizer and Moderna hold the patents for the current vaccines researchers would likely have to get the companies’ permission to use them for research into products like nasal or pan-coronavirus vaccines. Right now Pfizer isn’t sharing its vaccines for research purposes a spokesperson confirmed to STAT. Moderna didn’t comment when we asked.

Pfizer’s stance is legal and in line with the company’s commercial interests said Ana Santos Rutschman a professor of law at Villanova University.

“If you use this thing that has been patented what you’re doing doesn’t matter. Even if you’re trying to cure cancer the law is pretty rigid” she said.

But some university researchers argue the posture slows global progress toward more effective vaccines in the future especially since the United States has already wasted tens of millions of doses of the Covid-19 vaccines.

Yale University virologist and immunologist Akiko Iwasaki has designed a study of nasal vaccines against Covid-19 which she argues could provide better protection against infection and transmission than shots alone. The ideal study would be conducted on subjects that have already had a primary vaccine series to simulate real-world scenarios. She inquired with Pfizer about obtaining some vaccine to use in her study of nasal vaccines but has not received any.

“In order for us to develop a better vaccine we need a comparator. For that reason everyone who’s doing research in this area is in the same boat we don’t have access to do a comparison” Iwasaki said.

Iwasaki brought the issue up briefly at the White House’s summit on the future of Covid vaccines on July 26 and presidential science adviser Francis Collins said at the time that he “would not have thought of that” hurdle.

California Institute of Technology professor Pamela Bjorkman said her lab has had similar troubles obtaining existing Covid-19 vaccines that would otherwise be discarded in order to research a vaccine candidate that could provide protection against a variety of Covid-19 variants.

“Whatever policy prevents using such vials does a great disservice to global efforts to develop new and improved vaccines” Bjorkman said.

When asked whether Pfizer has provided any vaccines for research purposes spokesperson Sharon Castillo said “We are not accepting or reviewing applications for possible clinical research that studies the Covid-19 vaccine.”

Another Pfizer spokesperson also said the company has its own “extensive studies” of the vaccine underway and will continue to share information from those studies as it becomes available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY2FuLXlvdS1taXgtYW5kLW1hdGNoLXlvdXItY292aWQtYm9vc3Rlci1zaG90LzI5MzIzNDkv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jYW4teW91LW1peC1hbmQtbWF0Y2gteW91ci1jb3ZpZC1ib29zdGVyLXNob3QvMjkzMjM0OS8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can You Mix and Match Your COVID Booster Shot?,"For those who are planning to get a COVID booster shot will they need to get the same vaccine as their primary series or can they mix and match?

The answer depends.

Individuals 18 and older are eligible to receive either Pfizer’s or Moderna’s updated COVID booster shot at least two months after they've received their last booster dose or after they've completed their primary vaccine series U.S. health officials said.

While those younger than 18 years old are eligible for the new COVID booster they aren't eligible for the Moderna dose. Only Pfizer booster doses can be administered to those aged 12 through 17.

For those 12 and older who have not received a booster shot before the updated ""bivalent"" booster is now the only option.

So which booster shot should you get if you have a choice?

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend mixing products for your primary series doses boosters can be mixed.

Here's the CDC's guidance on mixing and matching for boosters based on which shots you have already received.

People ages 18 years and older may get a different product for a booster than they got for their primary series as long as it’s Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.

Teens ages 12-17 years may get a different product for a booster than they got for their primary series as long as it’s Pfizer-BioNTech.

Children ages 5 through 11 years who got a Pfizer-BioNTech primary series must also get Pfizer-BioNTech for a booster.

People ages 12 years and older may only get the updated (bivalent) mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) booster. They can no longer get an original (monovalent) mRNA booster.

Novavax is not authorized for use as a booster dose at this time.

Where can you get them?

Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.

Chicago-area pharmacies have already started appointments for updated booster shots many of which are ramping up this week.

CVS announced Friday one day after the CDC issued its recommendation for the new vaccine that some locations were already offering up doses of both Moderna and Pfizer's revamped booster shots. Appointments were opened up and several continue to be available for this week.

Walgreens locations are also now booking appointments for the newly approved COVID booster shots that specifically target the highly contagious BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants the pharmacy said in a release Friday.

“This season we encourage everyone to stay protected by getting vaccinated with this more targeted updated COVID-19 booster in addition to receiving their flu shot or other routine immunizations in a single visit"" Dr. Anita Patel vice president of Walgreens' Pharmacy Services Development said in the release.

According to a Friday announcement from the Illinois Department of Public Health the state expects to receive 580000 doses of the new booster. And that's in addition to the 150000 doses Chicago is primed to receive IDPH said.

Illinois health officials also urged people Friday to begin getting their doses this week.

“Once the updated booster shots become available next week I urge everyone in Illinois who is eligible to take advantage of the opportunity to get fully protected before we enter the fall season” IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said in statement Friday. “These new bivalent vaccines are designed to offer extra protection against the omicron variants which are now the dominant strain of the virus. Getting up to date now is especially important for those who are at risk of serious outcomes as the updated vaccines offer protection from hospitalization and even death.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYXJ0Lm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvbXlvY2FyZGl0aXMtZnJvbS1jb3ZpZC0xOS1ib29zdGVyLXJhcmUtYnV0LXJpc2staGlnaGVzdC1hbW9uZy10ZWVuLWJveXMteW91bmctbWVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Myocarditis from COVID-19 booster rare but risk highest among teen boys young men,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.heart.org/en/news/2022/09/06/myocarditis-from-covid-19-booster-rare-but-risk-highest-among-teen-boys-young-men on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYXJ0Lm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvbXlvY2FyZGl0aXMtZnJvbS1jb3ZpZC0xOS1ib29zdGVyLXJhcmUtYnV0LXJpc2staGlnaGVzdC1hbW9uZy10ZWVuLWJveXMteW91bmctbWVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvd2hlcmUtdG8tZmluZC1vbWljcm9uLXNwZWNpZmljLWNvdmlkLWJvb3N0ZXJzLXdhbGdyZWVucy1jdnMtY2xpbmljcy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvd2hlcmUtdG8tZmluZC1vbWljcm9uLXNwZWNpZmljLWNvdmlkLWJvb3N0ZXJzLXdhbGdyZWVucy1jdnMtY2xpbmljcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to find the new omicron-specific Covid boosters from Walgreens and CVS to local pharmacies and clinics,"Omicron-specific Covid booster shots are finally here — and possibly available at a vaccine site near you.

The new shots from Pfizer and Moderna are bivalent meaning that they target both the original Covid strain and omicron's BA.5 subvariant. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease and Control Prevention approved Pfizer's updated booster for people ages 12 and older and Moderna's updated shot for people ages 18 and older.

To be eligible you'll need to have completed your primary vaccination series — and be at least two months out from your last dose of any Covid vaccine according to the CDC. The agency's advisors also say that if you've recently had Covid you should consider waiting three months after testing negative before getting your updated booster.

The new shots are free of charge to receive for now. Here's where you can get them if you're eligible:

Walgreens is offering both Pfizer and Moderna's new boosters. The shots haven't reached all of the chain's locations yet but new appointments are being added daily. You can view and schedule appointments on the Walgreens website on the pharmacy's app or by calling 1-800-WALGREENS.

CVS is also offering both updated boosters. Its online system allows you to schedule multiple patients at once which could make it easier for your family to get vaccinated together. You can schedule those appointments on the CVS website or on the pharmacy's app.

Rite Aid which also owns Pacific Northwest chain Bartell Drugs began offering both Pfizer and Moderna's new boosters last week at some of its store locations. You can schedule an appointment on the Rite Aid website or the Bartell Drugs website.

Albertsons one of North America's largest grocery chains started offering Pfizer and Moderna's updated boosters at some of its locations on Monday — along with a coupon for 10% off your next grocery purchase if you get the shot. The company's brands offering the boosters include Albertsons Safeway Vons Jewel-Osco Shaw's Acme Tom Thumb Randalls United Supermarkets Pavilions Star Market Haggen Carrs Amigos and Market Street. You can view and schedule appointments on the Albertsons website or app.

Multiple states — including Massachusetts New Jersey and Colorado — have websites to help you find other clinics with new boosters in stock. Check your state's health department website to see if it's offering similar resources.

Vaccines.gov has a search filter for the ""newly authorized bivalent"" booster options which you can use to find other locations near you. The website says that if you can't find a convenient location you should check back later or contact your local health department or health care provider.

Walgreens' online scheduling tool makes it clear that a location is offering the ""updated booster."" Other pharmacies and clinics including CVS don't necessarily specify — but any booster shot you receive now will be the new one according to recent FDA guidance.

That's because when the FDA authorized the new boosters it also changed its authorization for the original ""monovalent"" vaccines that have been used since December 2020. Those original shots can't be used as booster doses for people 12 and over anymore though they're still the only primary vaccine options for unvaccinated people.

More than 200 million people are eligible for the new shots a CDC official said earlier this month. The Biden administration secured 171 million doses of the new boosters including 105 million from Pfizer and 66 million from Moderna ahead of the boosters' approvals — an indicator that the country's supply of free doses will likely meet demand from the general public.

If you can't find an appointment now don't worry: The doses are still being shipped out to vaccine sites across the country. Appointment availability will likely ramp up in the coming days and weeks.

Update: This story has been updated to reflect updated booster availability at Rite Aid Albertsons and Vaccines.gov.

In the study based on data collected from 109000 patients at a large Israeli health system the drug appeared highly effective in seniors. Researchers found that those 65 and older who got the drug shortly after infection had a roughly 75% lower chance of being hospitalized a rate which is consistent with earlier results.

However those markedly decreased odds of hospitalization were not seen in the 40-64 age cohort where researchers reported “no evidence of benefit.” That was the gist of their study writeup which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine and the storyline was duly repeated countless times in mainstream media coverage.

Yet the antiviral drug’s benefits were nearly as profound in younger adults who weren’t immunized a wrinkle which most of the headlines left out. In patients 40-64 years old without previous immunity (i.e. those who hadn’t been vaccinated and/or boosted) the benefit seen was 77% which is on par with that observed in seniors.

In other words without vaccination the drug seemed to work better in both older and younger adults.

This finding suggests that Paxlovid still “could have a benefit in the high-risk group of those under 65 who tend to be hospitalized” explained Dr. Reynold Panettieri Jr. a pulmonary critical care physician and professor of medicine at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who was not involved in the study.

Indeed the jury is still out as to whether it has benefit in reducing hospitalization in that younger patient group.

“The truth is that it worked much better in those 65 and older” said Panettieri. “But if you look at the sub-analysis and one wonders ‘Can Paxlovid have an effect?’ the answer is ‘Yes.’ The drug actually decreases the hazard ratio specifically for those who never got boosted before or were immunized.”

The study adds to the growing body of evidence around Paxlovid which has been heralded since its authorization by the Food and Drug Administration late last year. In that time the pill has been prescribed to treat certain patients who are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19.

One mystery surrounding the drug has been its potential link to the incidence of so-called ‘COVID rebound cases.’ No less than President Joe Biden First Lady Jill Biden and NIAID director Anthony Fauci have each suffered a relapse in symptoms after taking a full course of the oral treatment in recent months.

Pfizer brass suggested in an interview with Bloomberg in May that patients whose COVID symptoms relapse should take a second course of the antiviral pill. The FDA which at the time said that Pfizer’s advice was not supported by data has since asked the drugmaker to look into whether a second course can prevent the virus from returning.

The recent clinical data may also spur questions about the U.S. government’s reliance on Paxlovid which has become a mainstay of the Biden administration’s test-to-treat program. The U.S. government has spent $10 billion to buy 20 million doses of the drug and in yet another sign of support in July the FDA signed off on allowing pharmacists to write prescriptions.

But the administration may soon scale back its role in broadening access. The remaining federal supply is slated to run out by mid-2023 after which Paxlovid will transition to the commercial market health officials have said.

As to why Paxlovid’s benefits were less clear-cut in younger adults than seniors in the Israeli study Panettieri explained that the “incidence of occurrence [i.e. hospitalization] was different between the two groups” and that it could have “potentially influenced the observation and the conclusion.” He added that it “might take 200000 people to show the difference.”

That’s a statistical argument that’s beyond the interest of most lay audiences. The study was primarily designed to assess efficacy in both cohorts. Since the study missed its primary endpoint the secondary outcomes couldn’t be analyzed he said.

“But the data speaks for itself” said Panettieri. “You don’t want to get into an argument in the lay press about that nuance.”

How will the findings affect patient access? The bottom line he said is that if you’re over 65 you should get Paxlovid. If you’re under 65 the study doesn’t support its use.

“However the study has limitations namely that the number of events in the under-65 subjects (those who were going to be hospitalized) was markedly less than over-65 and that could have influenced the results” he said.

Additionally the secondary analysis shows that in those not immunized Paxlovid seemed to be beneficial in preventing hospitalization. That occurs whether you’re over or under 65.

“What I would like is not to say ‘Unequivocally there’s no benefit in under-65’” said Panettieri. “That’s an unfair statement.”"

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld asked a federal appeals court on Thursday to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion saying he didn't commit a crime.

If the convictions are allowed to stand attorney Yaakov Roth told a three-judge panel during oral arguments it could expose every elected official in the country to prosecution for accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld a former Cincinnati city councilman was found guilty of the charges in 2022 and sentenced last year to 16 months in prison. He's five months into that sentence now. But he is appealing his convictions and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Thursday.

The roughly 40-minute hearing took place in a courtroom packed with Sittenfeld supporters as well as attorneys interested in the outcome of the appeal which partly centers on what is corrupt when it comes to a politician accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld himself was not in the courtroom.

Roth began his argument by pointing to amicus briefs filed by 16 former federal public corruption prosecutors as well as a bipartisan group of former attorneys general and federal judges.

All of them Roth said are trying ""to tell this court that something has gone wrong.""

Judges question both sides

The judges − John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy − continuously asked questions of both sides throughout.

Many questions focused on whether Sittenfeld's actions were sufficient to be considered crimes. The judges also asked about topics that were raised repeatedly throughout the trial and in post-trial court filings.

Some questions centered on whether there was clear and unambiguous evidence of an exchange of money for official action − a quid pro quo.

At one point Nalbandian pointed out that Sittenfeld had promised to ""deliver the votes"" and get a ""veto-proof majority"" of City Council to support a development project in exchange for a $20000 donation to his political action committee.

Why couldn't the jury conclude that was evidence of corruption? he asked Roth.

Roth responded that prosecutors had strung together Sittenfeld's statements ""to make it into something it's not.""

Judges focus on conversation with developer

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer spent much of his 15 minutes of argument time responding to questions from the judges.

Two judges asked specifically about a recorded conversation between Sittenfeld and a local developer during which they talked about supporting Sittenfeld's then-planned mayoral campaign.

As Sittenfeld and the developer Chinedum Ndukwe talked about campaign donations Sittenfeld said: ""You don't want me … to be like 'Hey Chin like love you but can't.'""

Prosecutors at trial said Sittenfeld was threatening to withhold support for the project unless Ndukwe contributed. But Roth argued that the statement wasn't sufficient evidence of a crime and said it seemed as if prosecutors had stopped focusing on it.

During arguments Thursday Nalbandian asked Singer if prosecutors were ""running away"" from the ""love you but can't"" comment.

Singer said the statement was one part of a ""corrupt solicitation"" that involved multiple statements. It was ""evidence the jury could consider"" he said.

What's next

A decision is not expected to come for some time possibly not until after Sittenfeld completes his prison term.

Roth on Thursday asked the court to consider releasing him from prison while it considers the appeal. The judges did not indicate whether they will consider that. The decision impacts Sittenfeld's future because a felony conviction prevents him from holding public office ever again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvZmlubGV0ZS1vZmZlcnMtcGctdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vbmx5ZmFucy10aHJvdWdoLWF0aGxldGUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLTEyMzQ3NzgyNTUv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyNC9maW5sZXRlLW9mZmVycy1wZy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW9ubHlmYW5zLXRocm91Z2gtYXRobGV0ZS1pbnZlc3RpbmctMTIzNDc3ODI1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finlete Offers ‘PG Version of OnlyFans’ as Pro Investing Grows,"Rob Connolly’s first athlete-related start-up was Meetlete a sports-star version of Cameo. Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb2doZXIuY29tL2xpdmluZy9lbXBsb3llZS1yZXNvdXJjZS1ncm91cHMtZ3VpZGUtMzUxMzkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Bring Inclusion to Life: A Guide on Employee Resource Groups – Blogging Tips & Events for Content Creators ...,"Employee resource groups (ERGs) are defined as employee-led groups where employees can join together based on shared characteristics interests and perspectives. They are also a way for employees from non-minority groups to learn and become an ally. ERGs are great tools organizations can use to provide support and contribute to an employee’s personal development in the workplace. It’s also a great way to foster an inclusive environment especially in a workplace that may be comprised of mostly non-minority groups (according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the employment-population ratio was 58.3 percent for Blacks 60.7 percent for Whites 61.6 percent for Asians 62.9 percent for individuals of two or more races and 63.2 percent for Hispanics in 2018).

But in order for that to happen ERG leaders need the proper resources at their disposal to ensure they’re creating a safe and positive space where employees can be their authentic selves. Building a successful ERG doesn’t happen overnight but when it comes to establishing employee relationships with their fellow peers and the organization ERGs can be one very successful way to do just that. Below read what some ERG leaders and experts had to say about what makes ERGs successful and how to ensure they’re bringing inclusion to the forefront of a business.

Aimee Broadhurst Founder and CEO of Inclusive Space

“It’s been my experience that ERGs can actually be a catalyst for creating and bringing in DEIB (diversity equity inclusion and belonging) into the workplace” says Aimee. “Simply because that is a way to bring employees together. It’s also a way to offer them a safe space for them to engage with their allies and helps the company be viewed as walking the talk when it comes to DEI. There are so many things that ERGs can do from a programming perspective to be able to bring things to the communities that they are there to serve.”

Aimee adds that in order for an ERG to be effective the main thing it needs is support. “ERG leaders need to be trained in how to do this job so that they can balance their paid day job with their passion job” says Aimee. “It’s also incredibly important that there is leadership support from the top down and it’s very important that ERGs have executive sponsors who are passionate and engaged in helping the ERG leaders and in helping the ERG move forward.”

For ERG leaders looking for tools and/or training resources Aimee’s ERG handbook could be helpful. The ERG Leadership Alliance also offers boot camps and an ERG roadmap assessment “so that ERG leaders can see and understand where they are on the roadmap and where they need help” says Aimee. “Companies need to provide those resources to their employee leaders while executives receive training so that they can be effective in helping their ERG leaders navigate and develop ERGs.”

Carolyn Ramirez Vice Chair of the DiversABILITY Employee Resource Group at UC-Davis Health

The DiversABILITY Employee Resource Group at UC Davis Health was re-established in 2018 with the goal of bringing together a wide community made up of people with disabilities and their allies to develop resources and provide a safe peer-supportive environment. It began with five people and has grown exponentially largely in part to Carolyn.

“We have amazing ERGs that have been around for 10 20 years but there weren’t any really focusing on disabilities” she says. “I had a hip injury so I was on crutches for a really long period of time. I’ve always thought I was an empathetic understanding person but it definitely took me to new heights of empathy and understanding of what is it like to live with a mobility disability for a temporary period of time. It really raised my awareness that I want to continue to learn more about the variety of disabilities especially hidden disabilities.”

Four years later the DiversABILITY ERG is continuing to grow learn from other ERG organizations and succeed in its mission. But what exactly makes an ERG effective? In her opinion a large part of it comes down to executive leadership. “An organization where executive leadership understands recognizes and values employee resource groups especially the work that they do as its generally a volunteer basis is extremely important” she says.

“Another thing is to have people that want to do the work. It’s not just something that you show up to—you are there because you care about the mission and you want to contribute” she adds. “Thirdly is having an open mind and compassionate heart. We’re all human beings and we all have different experiences and opinions and sometimes they don’t mesh well. But being open to honest feedback and the human experience is crucial in learning from each other and growing.”

Jes Osrow DEI Expert and Co-Founder of The Rise Journey

Founded in 2017 The Rise Journey addresses the gap in DEIBA (Diversity Equity Inclusivity Belonging and Accessibility) and organizational development. Because of the work she does through organizations and ERGs Jes has firsthand experience of how ERGs can be used to bring inclusion to life. “ERGs are built upon that authentic self piece” she says.

“Bringing inclusion to life is really saying what do we need as an employee based on this identity or this specific need? And how do we make it real? If organizations could recognize that different identities have different needs especially in the workplace that’s the biggest way to bring inclusion to life.”

Jes recognizes that every organization is different making it difficult to measure an ERG’s success for a fortune 500 company versus a 20-person start-up. Nonetheless thinking critically about what you want the ERG to do as it pertains to a specific organization and measuring those goals is a good first step. “You need to make sure that if you’re asking your ERG to propagate these ideas you need to be able to measure it — whether that’s using an ERG software or using your employee polls and surveys” Jes says.

Maceo Owens Community Manager Employee Resource Groups at KAYAK and OpenTable

“ERGs are a great way to get employees involved in diversity efforts” says Maceo. “When diversity and inclusion efforts are driven solely by the D&I team things rarely move. ERGs breed D&I ambassadors and help companies learn what inclusion efforts are desired from employees.”

She adds that an effective ERG is able to understand what the community desires turn it into goals execute and measure it. “Regular touchpoints with members (events) regular requests for feedback (surveys and listening tours) and data-based strategy are some characteristics of an effective ERG” she says.

And when it comes to participation Maceo believes that leaders in the workplace should lead by example. “Leaders are the influencers of the workplace” she says. “If they are bought in others will be driven to participate as well. Employees don’t need permission to participate but by seeing leaders engaging in events in Slack and in D&I-related projects people are more likely to feel that it’s okay to engage.”

The terminal jointly developed by refiner Phillips 66 and commodities trader Trafigura had applied for a Clean Air Act permit in 2019 and received an EPA pollution control license in November 2020 that allowed it to emit almost 19000 tons of pollutants per year

Environmental groups had urged the agency to amend the permit to include reduction of pollutants by Bluewater which is located on the Gulf Coast near Corpus Christi by at least 95%.

The EPA revoked the permit on Thursday and has now directed the company to withdraw its applications by Sept. 15 and submit a revised proposal that meets pollution control norms according to the letter seen by Reuters.

Application of rules will cut pollution from the Bluewater terminal by 18000 tons a year said Gabriel Clark-Leach an attorney from the Environmental Integrity Project one of the groups that opposed the permit.

In a letter sent to the EPA the groups had argued that pollution from the terminal's offshore infrastructure poses risks to minority and lower-income communities.

Phillips 66 said it was reviewing EPA's letter while Trafigura did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The terminal has a potential to export up to 384 million barrels of crude oil per year on large tanker ships.

When I found out we were going to be grandparents we enrolled in a grandparents’ class at Saint Francis which brought us up-to-date on changes in baby care.** Another important step we took before our grandchild was born was getting our vaccinations updated and a car seat safely installed!

**Editor’s Note: Saint Francis now mails Grandparenting Resources to your home. Learn more at saintfrancis.com/event/grandparenting-resources

I was fortunate to be able to provide part-time childcare for the first fifteen months of my first grandchild’s life and we not only bonded during that time we explored Tulsa and all its wonderful fun and educational experiences! I’m lucky to live close to him and have the ongoing opportunity to take him on weekly adventures.

In addition to our experiences I’ve consulted with grandparents of older grandchildren. Although this guide is not an exhaustive list it contains the highlights and “must dos” as Callister and I see it. Although some places and activities may qualify for several categories I’ve done my best to divide them into the following: Nature Fun Outings Parks Arts Route 66 and Books.

Nature

Tulsa is lucky to have this jewel of a mountain perched on the Arkansas River begging to be hiked. Located north of 71st between Riverside and Elwood Turkey Mountain has plenty of parking at the base and also restrooms and a water fountain. From there you have a choice of trails ranging in degrees of difficulty but whichever trail you choose you’re sure to see flora fauna rocks and critters along the way providing “real life” science lessons!

Dogs are also welcome but must be on a leash. Always take along drinking water insect repellant and a cell phone. Older kids might enjoy the bike trails that start at Turkey Mountain and go along the west side of the river.

There are so many nature activities at Oxley Nature Center! They have butterfly walks bird walks full moon walks and more. Plus wide flat stroller-friendly trails (although they can get muddy!).

Eagle Watching

I have great memories of my parents waking us up early to drive to Keystone for breakfast picnics and to look for eagles. Although I haven’t personally seen one on the river apparently there are eagles’ nests and sightings along Riverside Drive around 71st street. The Audubon Society website would be a good place to start. Although I haven’t done this activity yet with my grandson I know it will be a future memory-making adventure!

Fun Outings

The Oklahoma Aquarium is officially in Jenks but since it’s right over the bridge from Tulsa and such a popular destination it needs to be included. This is one of my favorite places to go with my grandson because it’s not weather dependent.

If you’re retired like I am aim to take your young grandkids during the week when the rest of the world is at school or working. We buy a yearly membership which turns out to be much more cost-effective and makes me feel better about going for short visits. They have added a playground for nice weather days but when we visited recently there was no shade and the play equipment was hot to the touch so it might be a better activity for Fall or Spring.

The Tulsa Zoo is a fantastic day excursion for grandkids of all ages. Because we go frequently we buy an annual pass. This is one of the excursions for which I usually wait until my husband can accompany us because it’s a big place and I wear out before our grandson does. There are places to buy food and drinks scattered throughout the park and even on days that aren’t perfect weather-wise the buildings contain enough to entertain kids and adults for a few hours.

Discovery Lab is a wonderful opportunity for kids to learn about science through fun activities! Located in its new facility at Gathering Place it’s a perfect place for a grandparent-grandchild outing or a birthday party. There is a toddler area with activities for those visiting with younger children.

Check their calendar for activities and special events.

Bowling

Bowling is a fun activity for grandparents and grandchildren to enjoy together. It’s a good opportunity to interact while engaging in an activity. The Dust Bowl in downtown Tulsa is a retro-hip place and besides bowling they have a great menu. Or you can impress your grandkids by taking them to any of the great downtown restaurants within walking distance of the Dust Bowl.

On the other end of Tulsa Main Event has bowling plus a multitude of activities including laser tag arcade games gravity ropes billiards and mini-golf. One of my friends takes her out-of-town pre-teen and young teen grandkids to Main Event every time they come to visit.

Parks

No discussion of fun in Tulsa can exclude Gathering Place voted the number one new attraction in America (of 2018) and one of National Geographic’s twelve most mind-bending playgrounds in the world! We’ve taken our grandson so many times we’ve lost count yet each time we visit we see something new.

There is a lot of walking involved so be prepared with comfortable shoes. Even though my grandson is now two and maybe a bit old for the stroller I take it to carry bags a change of clothes in case he gets in the water features (of course he’s going to get in the water features!) and a place to put drinks. There are several places to buy reasonably priced food so I don’t bother to pack a lunch.

Did I mention there is no admission charge?! And if the park itself wasn’t a big enough draw there is extensive programming for kids including classes story times and concerts. To get a great parking place I recommend getting there early if at all possible. Along with most of the city we are big fans of Gathering Place!

Although this is seasonal Oklahoma’s largest splash pad recently opened at Chandler Park. But in addition to the splash pad Chandler has a lot more to offer with 92 acres of wooded area overlooking Tulsa and Sand Springs. There is a playground rock climbing two disc golf courses trails and picnic shelters.

LaFortune Park has 270 acres in midtown Tulsa with play equipment for the younger crowd golf tennis and a 5k walking trail for the more active older grandchildren. In the summer they have free First Friday concerts in the park. There is plenty of shade and also restrooms water fountains and picnic tables. Callister and I have spent many happy hours playing and walking at LaFortune.

I’m not sure this qualifies as a park but it’s a green space in the middle of the Arts District that offers frequent free events for families. There is always something going on at Guthrie Green including yoga concerts food trucks and story times.

River Parks is an amazing place for grandparents to take their grandchildren to walk ride bikes play in one of the parks or take a picnic and enjoy nature.

The east-side River Park trails go from 11th street to 101st street and connect to other area trails. There are also trails on the west side of the river that go from 11th street to the Turkey Mountain area at 71st. Along the east side there are several parks one at 17th 41st 71st and one at 96th.

Arts

If you grew up in the Tulsa Public School system in the ’60s like I did you probably remember loading up on the school buses and going to Philbrook on a rare field trip. The former home of the Phillips family this glorious mansion and grounds turned art museum was gifted to Tulsa by the Phillips family in the 1930s.

In addition to their permanent collection Philbrook has many family friendly and kid-focused events. I haven’t braved Philbook yet with my grandson but many of my friends with older grandkids love going there especially on “Second Saturdays” when admission is free.

If you’re looking for a fun and educational activity to do with your grandkids this will be a big hit! First Friday Art Crawl is free and as the name implies held on the first Friday of every month from 6-9 p.m. in the Tulsa Arts District.

Originally started to showcase the art of local artists it has expanded to include mini galleries many museums offering free admission and often live performances. Many of the shops stay open late on First Fridays and there are plenty of opportunities to eat at good restaurants!

This is an outing for all ages! Callister and I were fortunate to attend a stroller tour and I was pleasantly surprised to see his interest and enjoyment. After the guided stroller tour we went up to the artist studio on the third floor where he played with giant Lego blocks and I took a rest on the couch. While ahha no longer has their stroller tours listed on their calendar of events they do offer plenty of ongoing activities and special events. Learn more here.

In addition ahha also offer classes workshops and labs. It’s definitely worth checking out especially if your grandchild is a budding artist.

Route 66

I’ll admit I took this idea from a friend with older grandkids. Every year she picks a theme for the week her grandkids visit and this year was Route 66. Although she took her grandkids further along the route I’ll limit this discussion to Route 66 sites in Tulsa including several of which Callister and I have visited.

This is a great way to incorporate some history education disguised as fun. Most of Route 66 goes along 11th street but let’s begin with breakfast at Ollie’s a train-themed mom-and-pop-style restaurant in west Tulsa. Callister was thrilled with the train display! On the same street is the Route 66 village an open-air transportation museum.

From there head east to the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge and he Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza which has a bronze sculpture 20 feet tall by 40 feet showing the Avery family in a 1926 Ford encountering an oil-cart. This is a great photo opportunity!

Continuing east you’ll see the Meadow Gold vintage sign that was saved restored and is currently sitting on 11th between Peoria and Lewis. Not much further east is the new Buck Atom statue and Route 66 memorabilia gift shop. You can’t resist stopping here and having a picture taken!

By this time the grandkids are probably hungry again but even if they aren’t Mother Road Market at the corner of 11th Street and Lewis is worthy of a stop! Similar to an indoor food court (but with delicious local food!) it also has some shops and an outdoor patio with a Route 66 mini-golf course. If you have room for any more food after you leave Mother Road stop at Sweets and Cream as you head east on Route 66.

Unfortunately  many of the iconic motels along Route 66 in Tulsa have fallen into disrepair (and in some cases disrepute) and one of the only neat neon motel signs left is at the Desert Inn. If you’re willing to travel outside the boundaries of Tulsa there are lots of fun Route 66 sights but this will probably keep you busy and well fed for a day of Route 66 fun with grandkids!

Books

Because I’m a major book lover and seem to have been successful in passing this passion on to my grandson I can’t pass up the opportunity to be an advocate for reading to your grandkids. Read read read and then read some more beginning the day they are born.

It’s never too early to begin instilling a love of reading. Kids who are read to begin kindergarten having hear a million more words than kids who aren’t exposed to books. Besides giving them an educational boost it’s a lovely way to bond with your grandchild.

We are fortunate to have a fantastic public library system in Tulsa. I never get over the amazement that they will allow me to check out books absolutely free! I have been taking Callister to Schusterman-Benson for weekly story times every week since he was three months old and it’s become an ingrained part of his life an activity we look forward to every week.

There are story times all over the city. Check out the schedules and find one that fits your needs. Besides story times there are programs for all ages including bilingual programming. Click here to find TulsaKids’ monthly Story Times roundup!

Bookstores

We also have some great independently owned bookstores in the city. One kids of all ages will enjoy is Eleanor’s Bookshop at The Shops at Mother Road Market. Their entire selection is geared toward the younger set with an impressive variety of picture books through YA titles.

Older kids might enjoy a trip downtown to visit another independently owned bookstore Magic City Books. Magic City is one of my favorite spots to visit! In addition to a good selection of books they also have a coffee shop book clubs story times and they bring in fantastic authors to speak. Our community benefits in many ways if we support our locally owned bookstores!

Tulsa has so much to offer grandparents and their grandchildren but no matter what you choose to do with your grandkids the most important element is time together. Twenty years from now they may not remember exactly what they did or where they went with you but they will remember you listened hugged them gave them your undivided attention you loved them! The grandparent-grandchild relationship is like no other; treasure it and enjoy Tulsa together!

Whether you're a history buff foodie or nature lover this Midwest state delivers. Read on for the ultimate South Dakota road trip itinerary including where to stop what to do and more.

Sioux Falls

The state's largest city and likely the place where you'd fly into Sioux Falls is the logical starting point for a South Dakota road trip. If you're driving west follow this route but if you're heading east or flying into Rapid City on the western side of the state flip it. Sioux Falls is an ever-growing and extremely walkable city with lots of incredible food options. Stay at the Hotel on Phillips for an example of the posh direction the city is headed. After checking in and exploring the nearby falls the city is famously named after grab a happy hour drink on the PAve rooftop. Phillips Avenue Diner or Crave are the best spots for dinner and make sure to enjoy a cocktail at The Treasury an upscale bar conveniently located back at the Hotel on Phillips.

Must-see Stop: About an hour outside Sioux Falls stop by the world's only Corn Palace in Mitchell established in 1892 as a premier roadside attraction for a look at the famous murals and a photo-op with a giant smiling ear of corn.

Wall Drug Store

Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Tourism

Located just outside Badlands National Park and about four hours from Sioux Falls this massive 76000-square-foot roadside attraction started from humble beginnings with just the promise of free ice water to entice passersby. Now there are signs lining hundreds of miles of highway and displaying the many offerings of the beloved shop. Wall Drug Store now sports giant dinosaur and jackalope statues ample souvenirs a shopping mall an art gallery a restaurant serving delicious homemade doughnuts and of course free ice water for the roughly 20000 people who stop in every day.

Badlands National Park

The surreal landscapes of Badlands National Park alone are worth the drive to South Dakota. From the rolling hills of the prairie lands protrude jagged spires that quickly expand to the horizon. The formations look like they could crumble with the slightest touch but fear not as they are solid and very fun to climb for all ages. Check into a cabin at the Cedar Pass Lodge for a night or two and watch the sunset. The next morning continue driving along the Badlands Loop State Scenic Byway to glimpse wildlife such as bison bighorn sheep and prairie dogs.

Deadwood and Rapid City

Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Tourism

Make Rapid City your base for exploring Deadwood and the surrounding area as the city provides hub-and-spoke-like accessibility to many of the places on this list. About a 45-minute drive from Rapid City take a step back in time in historic Deadwood with its Old West-style main street full of boutiques restaurants and charm — and yes this is where the HBO series Deadwood was based and where you can visit the graves of Wild West heroes like Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane at Mount Moriah Cemetery. After role-playing as Billy the Kid head to the Hotel Alex Johnson in Rapid City for the night. The city is set among the Black Hills and the downtown area is a treat to wander through. The hotel's rooftop restaurant and bar Vertex Sky Bar is a nice spot for dinner. Another delicious spot is Murphy's Pub & Grill.

Must-see Stop: If you'll be spending a day or two in Rapid City swing by Main Street Square a public space that's home to family-friendly festivals live music a splash park in summer and a rocking ice skating rink in winter. The Journey Museum & Learning Center is also worth a look with exhibits highlighting the area's Native American culture and history as well as the Black Hills' dinosaur days.

Custer State Park

Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Tourism

Leave early in the morning to enjoy the fresh pine air of Custer State Park where herds of roaming bison regularly cause traffic jams (if this happens to you just keep your distance stay in your car and get those cameras ready). Head to Blue Bell Lodge for a perfect few hours of horseback riding through fields of flowers and trickling streams in the surrounding forests. Then grab a bite at the lodge's restaurant before heading to picturesque Sylvan Lake. After an afternoon of water activities drive to Custer for a pint and dinner at Mt. Rushmore Brewing Company and Pounding Fathers Restaurant (open seasonally). Finally cap off the day with some much-deserved shut-eye at Rock Crest Lodge & Cabins.

Must-see Stop: If time allows and you're heading from Custer up toward Mount Rushmore make time to visit the Crazy Horse Memorial an impressive monument carved into the side of a mountain that's dedicated to the life and story of the famous Oglala Lakota chief. Stop by the on-site museum to learn more about the area's rich Indigenous American history and culture then snap some photos of the massive (and still-under-construction) mountain sculpture.

Mount Rushmore

Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Tourism

On day four it's finally time to see the Founding Fathers' faces carved into the mountain — the enormity of the sculpture is truly a sight to see. Under Canvas has set up camp near Mount Rushmore National Memorial (seasonally from early May to late September) so you can enjoy luxury tented accommodations that evening along with on-site dining and camping activities.

Needles Highway

The last day brings a scenic 14-mile drive along giant granite spires. On this drive there will be breakneck turns hand-carved tunnels and vistas that will instill the wonder of South Dakota and solidify the past five days of incredible adventure in your memory forever. Continue your road trip through Wyoming Utah and Montana or stop here — the choice is up to you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8va3R1bC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90dWxzYS1tYW4tZGllcy1mb2xsb3dpbmctYS1zZW1pLXRydWNrLWNvbGxpc2lvbi1pbi1nYXMtc3RhdGlvbi1sb3Qtb2hwLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmfSAXRodHRwczovL2t0dWwuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3R1bHNhLW1hbi1kaWVzLWZvbGxvd2luZy1hLXNlbWktdHJ1Y2stY29sbGlzaW9uLWluLWdhcy1zdGF0aW9uLWxvdC1vaHAtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGluZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tulsa man dies following a semi crash in gas station lot,"Oklahoma Highway Patrol is investigating a collision that left a Tulsa man dead.

We knew Memphis was westernmost. We were topographically unique: flatter more swamp-like with rainy seasons like the tropics. We were tethered to Mississippi the state and the river and to the eighteen counties of the Delta. Which meant we looked and ate and sounded more like Mississippi than most of Tennessee. We made barbecue moonshine Tina Turner C. L. Franklin. We were a tambourine and a palm a double-time piano a worried line cooed over a bottom-heavy blues.

On a school trip to St. Louis we learned the city calls itself the “gateway to the west.” Texas we were told is bifurcated by the ninety-eighth meridian which signifies the start of the nation’s westward sprawl. Our part of the South and the West were geographic neighbors energetic kin—kissing cousins if you will sharing land mass and waterways and a constant exchange of people. The borders between us are soft elastic permeable.

Our generation played Oregon Trail on Apple IIes and read Willa Cather whose childhood move from northern Virginia to the plains of Nebraska inspired My Ántonia a novel I would come to love. My father lived in the Arkansas town where Howlin’ Wolf had been a radio jockey. Back then the cities just across the river had a reputation. They were raucous a kind of “wild wild West” with gambling and fun untamed parties. They courted an association with the frontier.

Rhoda Bell my great-grandmother was born enslaved near Selma. She went west to Mississippi when freedom came. There were forests to clear cotton to tend to silt-rich soil in which to plant. When Thomas Moss a postman and co-owner of People’s Grocery near Memphis was pursued by a lynch mob his final utterance according to Ida B. Wells was “If you will kill us turn our faces to the West.” Later Wells told an audience:

Hundreds left on foot to walk four hundred miles between Memphis and Oklahoma. A Baptist minister went to the territory built a church and took his entire congregation out in less than a month. Another minister sold his church and took his flock to California and still another has settled in Kansas.

During a speech at Brown Ralph Ellison echoed Wells. “Freedom was…to be found in the West of the old Indian Territory” he said. Ellison was born in Oklahoma City to parents from South Carolina and Georgia. Maybe some found freedom for a time: before the massacre in Tulsa? Storytelling about the West is often sentimental sweeping fanciful a rosy impression only slightly connected to reality.

Memphis became a city because the Chickasaw ceded their bluffs—four wooded rugged hills formed by the meanders of the Mississippi that were dense with green and rich loess soil. Most of Middle and West Tennessee had been carved out of a series of treaties and land grabs by the American government culminating in Congress’s Indian Removal Act of 1830. People who were Cherokee Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Seminole and made their homes east of the Mississippi were required to relocate along with their black slaves to unorganized territory west of Missouri. Over the next two decades more than sixty thousand former residents of the Southeast traveled treacherous routes west through north Georgia Alabama middle and western Tennessee southern Missouri and almost all of Arkansas. While researching Democracy in America Alexis de Tocqueville saw the scene in Memphis. “I saw them embark to pass the mighty river” he wrote. “No cry no sob was heard among the assembled crowd: all were silent.”

The state parks’ association says Arkansas is “the only state that witnessed the removal of all five of the Southeastern tribes as they moved west.” Pinnacle Mountain just west of Little Rock was a key site along the Trail of Tears.

In this issue frequent OA contributor Benjamin Hedin notes that Quatie Ross wife of Chief John Ross head of the Cherokee Nation at the time of removal is buried in Little Rock’s Mount Holly Cemetery. The legends say she died nearby on the Trail from Georgia after giving up her sole blanket to keep a young fellow traveler warm. Hedin speaks to a descendant of Chief Ross and visits the headquarters of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians which sits on the western end of North Carolina. The story about a soon-to-be published census of the Cherokee Nation before removal speaks to loss journeys place-making and also what and who remains.

The 2020 Census reported growth among every non-white group of residents in the U.S. including Indigenous households. The balmy December I last saw my father alive we drove past Pacaha burial mounds near the Hopefield Bend Revetment a levee on the Mississippi’s Arkansas side. He told me a DNA test had revealed an Indigenous ancestor from the 1700s. Hedin writes “So much of what is written about the Cherokees tends to emphasize removal.” We should remember that the American South has reams of Indigenous history dead and alive to recover and honor and connect with.

Other stories in the issue similarly reflect on journeys loss and the resonant joy that can be found in Southern place-making. Farah Jasmine Griffin travels to the town in middle Georgia where her grandmother grew up. With her immediate family Ms. Willie Lee Carson had moved North to Philadelphia and was less than willing to speak at length about where she’d come from. Still Griffin says “the South embodied in my grandmother held us together.” Maria Sherman writes about the song of coquis as part of the living soundscape of Puerto Rico her own ancestral home. Jarrett Van Meter in his OA debut travels to a part of Kentucky along the state’s border with Tennessee that is often quite literally left off from most maps of the state. He finds a close-knit cluster of families a beautiful expanding land mass and the freshest best-tasting catfish he’s ever encountered.

We’re proud to present wise and delightful short fiction from Elias Rodriques Melody Moezzi and the debut of Meghan Reed of Little Rock. “Where the Animals Sleep at Night” an enticing mélange of magical realism and traditional realism caught our eye because of its beautiful sentences its surreal moodiness and what it had to say about home adventure exile and the utter unknowability of other people.

The issue also features two pairs of poems by Mikey Swanberg and Erika Meitner. I love what Meitner writes about space place and the human body:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiaWEuY29tL25ld3MvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy9wcmF0dC13aGl0bmV5LW1hcmtzLWYxMzUtZW5naW5lLW1pbGVzdG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pratt & Whitney Marks F135 Engine Milestone » CBIA,"Pratt & Whitney celebrated a milestone August 31 with the delivery of its 1000th F135 production military jet engine.

The engine is the fifth generation powering the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet for the U.S. Department of Defense.

“The 1000th F135 delivery is a testament to the hard work of thousands of P&W employees and hundreds of suppliers who play a vital role in every engine that comes off the production line” vice president for the F-135 program Jen Latka said.

“This milestone underscores the maturity of the F135 which has been proven in the field as the safest most capable fighter engine in the history of military aviation.”

The engine is manufactured in Middletown and has production sites in West Palm Beach FL and a final assembly and check-out facility in Japan.

Capital Investments

Pratt & Whitney has invested more than $500 million in capital process improvements and cost reduction initiatives since delivering the first production engine in 2009.

The company has reduced the average unit cost of the F135 engine by more than 50% or $8 billion over that 13-year period.

Complete with more than 40000 pounds of thrust and an increase in thermal management capacity officials said the F135 delivers a step change in capability over previous generation engines.

The responsive integrated engine also provides another layer of reliability allowing the pilot to focus on their mission.

‘Pinnacle’

“Every one of those 1000 engines represents safe affordable reliable fifth generation propulsion capability in the hands of our customers” Pratt & Whitney Military Engines president Jill Albertelli said.

“The F135 is the pinnacle of combat propulsion ensuring our women and men in uniform can complete their missions in the most advanced threat environments and return home safely.”

“The F135 ensures our women and men in uniform can complete their missions in the most advanced threat environments.” Pratt & Whitney’s Jill Albertelli

Officials at Pratt & Whitney which employs more than 11000 people at its East Hartford and Middletown locations said the F135 has “ample” design margin to grow for F-35 missions of the future.

Pratt expects the proposed block upgrade to the F135 to deliver “the fastest most cost efficient lowest risk path to fully enabled Block 4 capability for all F-35 operators.”

The manufacturer also expects the upgrades will save taxpayers $40 billion in lifecycle costs while “building upon a combat-tested architecture with more than one million flight hours of dependable operation.”",,,,,,,,,

More than a year has passed since Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion complaint against Fox News; the network’s personalities (current) Maria Bartiromo Jeanine Pirro (and former) Lou Dobbs; and former President Donald Trump’s lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani.

As that case played out in New York Dominion has advanced a $1.6 billion complaint against Fox Corporation and Fox Broadcasting Company in Delaware. Both lawsuits took aim at the pro-Trump conspiracy theories involving the voting machine companies related to the election. The network failed to dismiss both lawsuits earlier this year though Powell and Pirro succeeded in booting the Smartmatic’s claims.

Inside a small civil courtroom in lower Manhattan Smartmatic’s lawyer Edward C. Wipper complained that Fox News has dragged its feet in sharing documents that it will need for a trial.

“It’s about delay” Wipper thundered. “This is the strategy here.”

Later in the hearing Wipper warned that Fox’s schedule would allow two election cycles to pass before resolution.

“We’re going to be barrelling into another election cycle where my client’s name is going to be besmirched” Wipper said.

A Delaware judge already has ordered broad discovery against Fox Corporation in the Dominion litigation.

“Numerous Fox witnesses are being deposed including defendants in this case” Wipper said.

Fox estimates that it has produced 4.3 million documents in that case but the network complains that the Delaware judge has not allowed for a review to protect their First Amendment rights as a news network.

“The judge in that case hasn’t even allowed us to do a responsiveness review” remarked Fox’s attorney K. Winn Allen referring to the Dominion case.

“Every incremental release is harmful to us from a First Amendment perspective” Allen added requesting discovery that’s “tailored” to the case.

Smartmatic wants the Manhattan judge to order Fox to turn over equivalent discovery in both cases arguing that the conspiracy theories regarding one voting machine company sprang from the other.

In the broadcasts at issue Wipper said Giuliani and Powell falsely claimed that Smartmatic owned Dominion.

“That was the whole arc of their lie” Wipper noted.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice David Cohen ordered Fox to turn over the discovery haul that it gave Dominion subject to any claims of privilege or disputes about relevance. The judge added that Fox must turn over many of the depositions taken in the Delaware case.

“My ruling on the depositions is named defendants and common witnesses” Cohen said.

Under the terms of the ruling Fox’s productions of documents must start on Sept. 30 and all fact discovery must be completed by the last business day in March 2023.

Smartmatic and Fox are likely going to dispute what documents they deem to be relevant for the litigation.

For Smartmatic’s lawyer the information can broadly include anything pertaining to what he described as “the Big Lie that caused the riot in the Capitol on Jan. 6.”

Judge Cohen appeared unlikely to agree to that definition of relevance asking Smartmatic’s counsel whether he was making Fox’s point for them.

“This case is about Smartmatic” Cohen emphasized.

For Smartmatic the company itself fit into the network’s “larger election narrative.”

“The people who were advancing this narrative […] they weren’t only speaking about Smartmatic” he said.

The network and the voting machine company likely will hash out any disputes in a follow-up conference that has been slated for Nov. 15 2022 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

FOX News Media said in a statement to Law&Crime that the Smartmatic lawsuit is a threat to freedom of the press.

“We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected in addition to the damages claims being outrageous unsupported and not rooted in sound financial analysis serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs” the statement said.

Africa’s paint and coatings market continued to report mixed performance in the period prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 a trend that has continued even as leading global companies announce divestitures and acquisitions that are likely to directly or indirectly impact the overall market performance in the long-term.Although some of the divestitures are a culmination of re-alignments and tweaking by the companies of their business strategy in the Middle East and Africa the impact of COVID-19 may have accelerated the decisions to sell their interest in the region.American Fortune 500 company PPG Industries which is active in 75 countries globally where it supplies the construction consumer products and industrial markets is the latest major international company to announce divestiture from some of the African markets.PPG said on April 1 2022 it has approved the sale of its business interest in Senegal Ivory Coast Cameroon Gabon and Algeria to French industrial group Océinde.However Océinde which is also active in Europe the Indian Ocean and Africa in telecommunications and the media sector construction painting and food sector will continue to offer the existing PPG range of products including SEIGNEUIRE paint through a licensing and distribution agreement according to PPG’s statement.“This partnership will strengthen a longstanding relationship between the companies which includes the supply of specialty materials from Océinde to PPG” the company said.PPG had committed in December 2020 to implement a plan targeting disposal of selected entities “in smaller non-strategic countries.”However all employees in the four African entities that PPG is selling will join Océinde with the company. Olivier Bouin currently PPG general manager Architectural Coatings Africa French Overseas and Suriname will become the new general manager for the trade architectural coatings market in Africa at Océinde once the deal is completed.“We are convinced that this change of business model will benefit our customers in Africa” said Pascal Tisseyre PPG vice president Architectural Coatings Europe Middle East and Africa.“Both companies are looking forward to working together to better serve the African market” he added.Océinde’s CEO Nassir Goulamaly said that PPG’s divestiture from the four markets and the decision to allow current employees to remain at their work stations demonstrates “the trust shown by PPG as well as all the employees who are joining us today.”“We have been investing for decades in the innovation of architectural coatings dedicated to the growing African market and this agreement will help us support that” said Goulamaly.PPG had previously said the revenue from the four entities it will divest from in early 2022 was equivalent to less than 1% of its annual net sales.“As a result the assets and liabilities of these entities were reclassified as held for sale and impairment charges of $21 million and $52 million were recorded in the consolidated statement of income for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively” PPG had said in its 2021 Annual Report.The divesture comes at a time when PPG says it has achieved all-time record sales of $16.8 billion for 2021 which is 21% more than the previous year.“This was led by strong organic growth of 10% and several strategic acquisitions” the company said.Apart from divesting from the four African markets PPG said it has been strengthening its position as a leader in global paints market by completing and approving more acquisitions including the integration of Ennis-Flint in December 2020.After 2020 PPG said it began “integrating the companies acquired in 2021 including VersaFlex Cetelon Wörwag and Tikkurila.”These five acquisitions added $1.7 billion of annualized revenue expanded PPG’s sustainable product offerings and moved PPG into new markets.PPG’s reduction of its Africa market share comes months after Japanese paint industry giant Kansai announced disposal of shares in two business entities in Nigeria and Middle East as part of its plan to realign low-profit assets so as to improve the company’s business competitiveness.The second phase of Kansai’s realignment affected Kansai Paint Middle East FZCO (KPME) Kansai Plascon Africa Ltd (KPAL) and Nigeria.In the case of KPME and Nigeria Kansai said it had reached an agreement “to sell all shares owned by us to the partner.”However the Plascon brand licensing will continue for the Nigerian case with transaction resulting in a profit boost effect of 100 million yen ($ 807000).Kansai made entry into the Nigerian market in 2016 av few months before it announced partnership with Paints and Coatings Manufacturers Nigeria (PCMN).In the United Arab Emirates Kansai was divesting from KPME and selling its stake to its joint venture partner G6 International although the existing technology license will continue. Kansai said divesting from the UAE will lead to an annual profit boost effect of 1.5 billion yen ($12 million).In South Africa Kansai said it amortized the remaining goodwill KPAL all at once with annual profit boost effect of 1.1 billion yen ($ 8.8 million).In hindsight divesting from some of these African markets by companies such as PPG and Kansai at the time they did may have been a perfect coincidence taking into consideration the devastating impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020.Although growth of the paint industry is expected to make a rebound in the long term Kansai’s president Kunishi Mouri said in the short term the outlook “remains uncertain due to a number of risk factors such as global trade issues future prospects for the Chinese economy trends in emerging economies uncertainty surrounding policy and fluctuations in the financial and capital markets.”Africa’s economic stagnation has also impacted the global construction machinery market with China the continent’s leading supplier reporting a decreasein demand.In Africa Kansai said the company’s sales for 2020 through to 2021 were “sluggish.”However with Africa’s current recession the worst in 50 years predicted to have started ebbing away from last year the continent’s economic growth is likely to surge by 3.4% spurring revival of key paint consuming sectors such as construction and manufacturing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On living through non-normal events: “Crazy big stuff happens. It's okay to use things like the normal distribution as long as you never forget that it is an approximation to reality and sometimes a very bad approximation. You have to think about the worst cases. You could certainly argue that COVID was an example. The meme stock craze was an example of a non-normal event. I can't decide about now. I think everybody has the arrogance to think they're living through unique times including me. It's always like ‘No one's ever experienced this before.’ … I think what we've been experiencing for the last 6-12 months is a return towards normalcy. Positive interest rates. Spreads between cheap and expensive still very high but not being astronomically high. And that involves a lot of pain for some people but that's not abnormal. What's abnormal is probably the ten years after the GFC [Global Financial Crisis] with very very cheap money and virtually any strategy long doing well without a lot of very bad hiccups … The things we look back and call ‘painful’ over that 10-year period you laugh at now.”

On pursuing a career in financial services: “Be really careful you're not shifting your career to chase the hot thing. I particularly tell this to students in business school … If you love something just do it and you might be early. But if a big part of why you're doing it is it's the thing everyone wants to be doing now I think you're going to be three to five years late … I don't believe in doing something you don't like. So find something that you find interesting that the world needs and you'll do well.”

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

You’d be wrong,"Corporate hypocrisy is as old as corporations themselves. But there are levels. It is important to recognize astounding achievements in business insincerity. So let us send a note of congratulations today to Starbucks: rarely in modern history have we witnessed a company that so exquisitely combines a cultivated image as a caring progressive employer with the well-documented large-scale behavior of a gangster who expects to rule employees through bullying and fear.

The $100bn coffee-and-flavored-syrup chain meticulously refers to its employees as “partners”. What does it mean to be a partner to someone? Reasonable people might say that a partnership is a relationship in which you treat the other person as an equal zealously uphold their basic rights and deal with them in all cases as fully formed human beings deserving of respect. Luckily for Starbucks they’ve had a great chance to exhibit these values over the past year as thousands of employees at more than 230 of their stores across the country have voted to unionize. The historic union wave has offered the company an unprecedented opportunity to respect their “partners’” right to organize; to listen to their concerns and requests for change; and to bargain contracts with them in good faith as partners of course should.

To say that Starbucks has failed to live up to their progressive reputation would be far too polite. It’s more like the union is Scooby-Doo and they have yanked off the company’s pleasant mask to reveal Tony Soprano lurking underneath.

This week the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said that Starbucks had illegally withheld raises and other benefits from its unionized workers. This is one of the oldest pseudo-friendly union busting tactics in the book – a company in the midst of a union campaign will hand out goodies to its non-union employees and then shrug theatrically and say: “Gee we’re not allowed to give these things to the union people!” (which as the NLRB has affirmed is a lie).

And that giant illegal ripoff is not even the worst part. The union Starbucks Workers United says that the company has fired more than 85 workers for organizing. The company has begun permanently closing stores that recently unionized or were in the process of doing so. The NLRB still has hundreds of charges of illegal labor practices against Starbucks that it has yet to rule on. There were so many GoFundMe campaigns floating around for fired Starbucks workers that the union finally had to set up a national Solidarity Fund to try to help them all. In the midst of all of this brash intimidation Starbucks has complained that the NLRB has unfairly favored the union which is akin to a bank robber complaining that the police are unfairly favoring the bank.

What accounts for the hubris of a company that so boldly risks its own reputation to flout labor law and treat its “partners” like so many automatons who must be whipped back into submission? I’m no psychoanalyst but I imagine that it flows from the same source as the hubris that made the billionaire Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz imagine that he could get elected president as an independent. It seems that none of Schultz’s sycophants were brave enough to tell him up front that he is perhaps the single worst presidential candidate you could ever imagine: Conservatives hate him because he pretends to be progressive; progressives hate him because he is in fact a cutthroat billionaire businessman who slathers himself in symbolic liberalism to ward off accurate criticism; and his own employees hate him because he treats their request for labor rights like an act of war.

Schultz who returned to Starbucks as CEO this year for the express purpose of fumbling the company’s response to unionization seems to imagine himself as some sort of kindly Stewart Brand figure who will redeem capitalism but acts in practice like just another irate union-buster – Andrew Carnegie with an espresso machine. (A monstrous bit of Democratic party trivia: Hillary Clinton reportedly considered Schultz as labor secretary in her presidential administration something that the next reporter to interview Clinton should absolutely ask her about.)

It may be that the very idea of a “progressive corporation” is given the realities of American capitalism an oxymoron. But anyone who has ever held a job understands what a good employer is. It is someone who treats workers as humans. When you get right down to it the demands of the many Starbucks workers who have unionized are downright modest. They have asked the company to sign a pledge to simply allow workers to choose to organize “without fear of reprisal”. The company has not only refused to sign but has dedicated itself to instilling fear of reprisal in the hearts of every single employee. That is not how a good boss treats his workers. That is not how a genuine progressive treats anyone. And it is certainly not how you would treat a “partner”.

In Boston recently I stopped by a unionized Starbucks store where workers have been on strike for more than a month. Through scorching days and lonely nights these young workers who could have spent the time doing anything more fun have maintained a 24/7 picket line. That is not something people do if they do not care – about their co-workers about their rights and about the company itself. Schultz who sits in his $30m mansion and sends out messages exhorting his employees to show “collective courage” has not been there. He should pay it a visit. I bet they could teach him a lot about what real progressive values look like.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL2NoaWxlYW5zLWhlYWQtcG9sbHMtZGVjaWRlLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLW5ldy1jb25zdGl0dXRpb24tMjAyMi0wOS0wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chile overwhelmingly rejects progressive new constitution,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chileans-head-polls-decide-progressive-new-constitution-2022-09-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL2NoaWxlYW5zLWhlYWQtcG9sbHMtZGVjaWRlLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLW5ldy1jb25zdGl0dXRpb24tMjAyMi0wOS0wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGF4Zm91bmRhdGlvbi5vcmcvZGF0YS9hbGwvZXUvaW5jb21lLXRheC1pbmZsYXRpb24tYWRqdXN0bWVudHMtZXVyb3BlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Income Tax Inflation Adjustments in Europe,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGF4Zm91bmRhdGlvbi5vcmcvZGF0YS9hbGwvZXUvaW5jb21lLXRheC1pbmZsYXRpb24tYWRqdXN0bWVudHMtZXVyb3BlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710B57730>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGF4Zm91bmRhdGlvbi5vcmcvZGF0YS9hbGwvZXUvaW5jb21lLXRheC1pbmZsYXRpb24tYWRqdXN0bWVudHMtZXVyb3BlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2QxMzY2OWUwLWY0YTUtNGJhNS05MTQyLTY5YTZkMDM4Mzg1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Starbucks became an American punch bag,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The highly anticipated efficiency and effectiveness that telematics brings to claims is now a reality. Before telematics crash data insurers had to wait for customers to call before reacting to a claim manually collecting information and entering it into their systems. Now with DriveWell Crash & Claims insurers can offer proactive real-time services to their customers providing peace of mind and life-saving help. Telematics crash data helps insurers create a streamlined claims experience for their customers after a traumatic event.

CMT has pioneered telematics-based car crash detection. Since CMT first began detecting car crashes with mobile telematics in 2016 18 organizations worldwide have adopted the company’s crash and claims products and solutions. Over 2.1 million drivers are protected every day by CMT-powered crash detection and proactive claims services.

“We’ve been leveraging telematics data to speed up the claims process for our Snapshot mobile customers” said Aimee Swartz Director of Claims Process at Progressive Insurance. “By utilizing telematics data we’re able to detect major accidents and leverage driving data to help expedite the claims process to get our customers back on the road sooner.”

By using CMT’s AI-driven DriveWell® platform to detect car crashes from sensor data auto insurers can proactively help customers with emergency and tow services within seconds of a crash. Learning about a crash as soon as it happens also enables insurers to use in-network providers reducing the cost of each claim.

Real-time services like crash assistance are popular with consumers averaging a Net Promoter Score of over 80. These services help insurers increase digital adoption and fuel the growth of proactive claims services.

“The paradigm shift with DriveWell Crash & Claims is that we’re now able to detect crashes and understand critical information about the crash within seconds. This information took many hours or even days to reach insurers in the past. Now they can be proactive and make decisions much sooner” said Cornelius Young VP of Product Crash and Claims for CMT. “It’s a virtuous cycle. Consumers want the peace of mind offered by crash detection and emergency response. Insurers want to help their customers and make claims operations more efficient.”

DriveWell Crash & Claims features not only real-time crash detection and assistance but also total loss injury and fraud detection capabilities.

Total loss indicator: By analyzing the telematics data available at the time of a crash along with other accident and vehicle details CMT can identify when a vehicle is a total loss. Determining when a vehicle is a total loss at or near the time of crash will save auto insurers hundreds of dollars per claim and help them get customers back on the road faster.

Injury detection: DriveWell Crash & Claims identifies crashes with potential injuries. Injury detection helps insurers channel the right claim to the right adjuster sooner ensuring more experienced adjusters handle more complex claims and reduce legal costs.

Fraud identification: DriveWell Crash & Claims helps insurers identify fraud faster. With telematics data like date time location driving patterns and other data points insurers can better identify fraudulent claims.

Newark Symphony Hall turns 100 in 2025 and as the centennial approaches the storied venue in the state’s largest city is pursuing a $50 million capital improvement campaign to revitalize and restore the landmark. It moved closer to that goal last week with the addition of $2.75 million.

The new funding for the effort announced Sept. 2 comes from fellow Newark anchor institution Prudential Financial and from the Mellon Foundation. The former contributed $2 million for the renovation project while the latter’s $750000 will go toward programming for NSH.

“Newark Symphony Hall is a community pillar and long-time partner” said Prudential Financial Vice President of Inclusive Solutions Nicole Butler in a prepared statement. “This funding helps preserve a historical treasure continues our support of Newark’s vibrant arts community and moves Newark Symphony Hall closer to achieving its renovation goals.”

NJBIZ Conversations:

Taneshia Nash Laird In 2021 the CEO of Newark Symphony Hall Taneshia Nash Laird joined NJBIZ to discusses the venue’s renovation how the pandemic was challenging the arts community and more. Watch here.

Those goals include a new exterior façade and streetscape in addition to modernizing and reactivating interior community and creative spaces and the re-introduction of commercial space for offices on certain floors of the building. Leading the effort and the historic venue is CEO Taneshia Nash Laird. The work is expected to create 500 construction jobs and contracting opportunities for 50 small businesses from the community.

Located at 1020 Broad St. in a designated Opportunity Zone the Newark Symphony Hall project is also expected to utilize federal historic tax credits and other economic development funding tools for catalytic projects. And for the first time in decades the venue saw state funding from the Fiscal Year 2022 ($5 million) and 2023 ($6 million) spending plans.

Laird will celebrate her fourth anniversary as CEO in November. According to her the venue increased its earned revenue by more than 100% during the pandemic.

Some of that comes from productions using the space – like the USA Network series “America’s Big Deal” which broadcast live from the venue in 2021 or the Hulu drama series “Wu-Tang: An American Saga” which transformed the 145000-square-foot complex for two episodes – and all of it comes ahead of any physical construction. As Laird noted in July “The only thing we did is change the perception of what Newark Symphony Hall can be. And so now we are part of a national conversation around inclusive economic development.”

That inclusive nature also speaks to another component contributing to NSH’s second-coming: The programming that has returned to the space.

The Mellon gift in particular will help to set up a new programming department at NSH with three years of support for a director manager and coordinator. According to NSH this marks the first time in nearly 20 years that the facility will have a dedicated programming staff. Last year a financial commitment from the foundation allowed Laird to expand the leadership ranks at NSH.

Speaking over the summer Laird illustrated a vision that “support[s] the people that have been supporting Symphony Hall for years.” Following the new funding she said a major programming focus will be to “center the cultures of communities of color those traditionally marginalized but who constitute majorities in the city and state and around the globe — including from the African Latinx and Asian diasporas.”

The new programming department will be tasked with assessing the community’s needs developing internal infrastructure and scaling scope and reach for its efforts.

As Newark Symphony Hall continues its re-emergence as an anchor institution in the city Laird acknowledged the role other leaders have played in those efforts.

“It could not have happened without Prudential’s belief that Newark Symphony Hall could truly anchor this side – the very tip the very end other than the park – of the mayor’s new arts and education district” she said over the summer.

Shanè Harris Prudential’s vice president of inclusive solutions head of social responsibility and partnerships and president of The Prudential Foundation detailed the importance of cultural anchors as critical drivers of Newark’s revitalization during a tour of the city in July.

“One of the things that has been interesting and some of the feedback that we’ve gotten is that anchor institutions traditionally have been … eds and meds right? And in Newark we are really harnessing a diversity of leaders and institutions to really drive growth in the city. And that includes corporates … but it also includes arts and cultural institutions that have really been the the backbone of the vibrancy for the city.”

When it comes to the national perception of Newark and how far from reality that image may lie Harris said that arts and cultural anchor institutions have been driving the change of that narrative “and really demonstrating how we could holistically connect with community and have community drive the course of the city.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpheGRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvc2VwLzA2L3BydWRlbnRpYWwtYnVpbGRpbmctb24tZG93bnRvd24tc291dGhiYW5rLXNvbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prudential Building on Downtown Southbank sold | Jax Daily Record,"Chicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors purchased the Prudential Building on the Downtown Jacksonville Southbank commercial real estate firm JLL Capital Markets announced Sept. 6.

“As a pioneer in digital insurance in Cambodia we want to protect people from threats to their health and wellbeing as well as support them to achieve their goals.

“We have created a range of digital solutions for first time insurance buyers to conveniently access affordable protection solutions via their smartphone.

“As not all Cambodians have regular access to stable high-speed internet connections we now go the extra mile to bring protection solutions into local communities through our insurance selling machines” said Sanjay Chakrabarty the CEO of Prudential Cambodia.

Making insurance accessible nationally

With their own internet connection and power supply the insurance selling machines can serve customers at any location in Cambodia.

This innovation enables customers to easily purchase a bite-sized insurance product for less than $10 per year even at locations without access to stable internet or a bank branch.

The inclusive user experience designed for the insurance selling machines is also optimised for customers requiring greater accessibility options such as larger text display for elderly users.

Having completed their purchases customers can obtain receipts of their transactions from a printer connected to the insurance selling machine an important step for first-time users.

Upon issuance of their policies customers can instantly manage and submit claims through Pulse the company’s all-in-one health and wealth management app.

Customers can simply follow the details provided by the insurance selling machine to download and register on Pulse.

“After initially launching these insurance selling machines at a number of locations we will closely work with our customers to continually refine the user experience before making them available nationwide” said Chakrabarty.

The September 2 launch saw insurance selling machines installed at Prudential branches in Phnom Penh Siem Reap Battambang and Kratie.

“When The Beatles came to [their] hotel the crowds broke through the police lines… it looked like a tsunami like the tide broke. I saw policemen on their horses go down” famed radio disk jockey Bruce “Cousin Brucie” Morrow told The Post.

“They wanted souvenirs so they would grab and rip. They took shirts they took clothing they took pieces of hair they got hair from The Beatles.”

Afterwards and in a state of panic Starr and Paul McCartney rushed over to Cousin Brucie inside his WABC studio — the DJ had helped fuel the band’s incredible popularity in the US — and enlisted his help in getting back the St. Christopher medal.

Moments later Cousin Brucie was on the air requesting whoever had “found” it come forward with the medallion — and unbelievably it was returned to the drummer as part of a later press event.

It was just one of the defining moments in the 100-year history of WABC — the iconic radio station first known as WJZ before turning over to its current callsign in 1953 which is celebrating its centennial with a party on Sept. 7 as well as producing a series of hourlong radio documentaries on the history of the station.

It was there that Howard Cosell launched his legendary broadcasting career with a Little League baseball show; radio host Curtis Sliwa angered the mob and was shot up in a cab as retribution; and conservative commentators launched their careers with pull-no-punches talk.

But just over 15 years ago things were looking down when Disney sold the station to Citadel in 2006 WABC creative director Chris Libertini explained.

The following year the station changed hands once more this time to Cumulus which gutted WABC and fired the entire news department according Libertini. By the late 2010s WABC was at risk of becoming a repeater for either a Russian or Korean radio station before local businessman John Catsimatidis and his wife Margo acquired it for $12.5M in 2020.

“We believe in live radio” Catsimatidis told The Post noting that “music radio talk radio and news” are all part of today’s mix.

To broaden the station’s focus on national politics he rehired Cousin Brucie — “He was 86 years old but I gave him a 30-year contract” Catsimatidis joked — and brought on additional weekend music hosts such as Deana Martin (daughter of Dean) and Joe Piscopo.

Below a look at some of the station’s most memorable moments in its 100 years of broadcasting here in NYC.

W-A-Beatle-C with Cousin Brucie

The Beatles first invaded the United States airwaves in 1963. It was tunes like “I Want to Hold Your Hand” that had American girls and boys going berserk over the British sensation when they first toured the US — with the band playing Queens’ Forest Hills Stadium in the summer of 1964.

Ahead of the invasion Cousin Brucie became a mouthpiece for the band and even struck a special deal with their record company to play “I Want to Hold Your Hand” ahead of its 1963 release — reaching 40 states at the time on his local signal.

It was such an exclusive coup that a security guard for The Beatles’ label kept the record in a locked briefcase handcuffed to his wrist until air at 9 p.m. exactly.

“That’s where [American Beatlemania] really started” Cousin Brucie told The Post. “I’m reaching half the world [at 9 p.m.] on WABC so I put her on the air. And all hell broke loose. I think I played it eight times.”

Brucie’s special relationship with The Beatles — which would earn the station’s nickname “W-A-Beatle-C” — grew in time as the band conquered US radio. He interviewed “the guys” as he called them inside their room at the Warwick Hotel on 54th and Sixth in that summer of ’64.

“They were very nervous” he said. “They never really had a New York City welcome before. And when New York City welcomes somebody there’s none like it none second. It worked absolutely beautifully. WABC in those days was the center we were like the control room for The Beatles.”

When radio stations would try recording WABC’s live broadcast to get playable copies of the music Brucie came up with the idea of vocally watermarking the tracks to block the copy cats.

That wasn’t the last time Brucie and The Beatles would connect. While the band was out and about in the city that August a rabid fan ripped off Starr’s St. Christopher medal. Both Starr and Cousin Brucie used the airwaves to get it back through another interview.

“‘I lost me St. Christopher’s metal that me auntie gave me'” he recalled Starr telling him.

“And he was very upset. Somebody grabbed it off his neck as a souvenir. And I said very foolishly ‘Was it real gold?’… and he said ‘Cousin Brucie I only wear real gold’ and he got a little snippy and we got along great after that.”

“So I went on the air and I said ‘Look whoever found — I didn’t say took — I said whoever found Starr’s St. Christopher’s medal you’re not in trouble … I want you to have your mom and dad call me at this number.’ I knew that I had something very important here. Well after I got off the air a few minutes later I received a call.”

Cousin Brucie and the station arranged for the fan who “found” the medal to meet in person in front of a massive press corps at the hotel.

“I told her if you bring this back the St. Christopher’s medal Ringo will kiss you. I said to Ringo ‘Ringo will you give her a hug and a kiss?’ and he said ‘Absolutely.'”

The retrieval of Starr’s medal is something the two still reminisce over to this day Brucie said.

The blackout of ’77

The Bronx was burning and serial killer David “Son of Sam” Berkowitz was running amok when the city was plunged into darkness in the summer of 1977.

With the city already in a historic crisis mode 25 hours in the dark brought on by a substantial strike and a stay-at-home advisory from Mayor Abraham Beame simply had New Yorkers terrified on July 13 1977.

Their panic was legitimate: Over a thousand fires were lit 1600 stores had been looted and a 17-year-old was murdered in Carroll Gardens during the outage.

“Everybody was listening to us all overnight they were in the streets waiting to hear what was going on” Libertini said noting that host George Michael and news director Paul Ehrlich had managed to get the mayor and reps from the Public Service Enterprise Group on air for updates — despite the two entities being at each other’s throats at the time.

Along with getting the big pols on air Michael and Ehrlich were giving hyperlocal updates — talking to New Yorkers and alerting listeners to reports of riots and chaos in the streets.

“Ultimately the station kept the city calm in a time of extreme chaos. It was one of our proudest moments” Libertini said.

WABC remained on air from a backup generator which was installed after the 1965 blackout forced radio host Dan Ingram to drive to Lodi NJ to broadcast.

The day the music died

On the morning of May 10 1982 WABC bid farewell to music programming and switched over to strictly talk radio that afternoon.

“The Day the Music Died” as it’s since been called signaled a changing of the guard as FM radio took over as the preferred way for listeners to enjoy tunes from its cleaner sounding audio.

Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy were the final music hosts on the station and put together a special 36-minute compilation of song clips from 1953 — when WABC took over the station — through the early ’80s.

“They covered every [iconic] piece of music there had been during their time on the air” Libertini who put together a documentary on the fateful day said. They played tunes like Bill Haley’s “Rock Around the Clock” Queen’s “We Will Rock You” and even “Start Me Up” by the Rolling Stones.

The first ever talk host was Art Athens who invited Ingram and Lundy on as his first guests in tribute to their mark left on radio according to Libertini.

Two years later famed conservative host Bob Grant — who made waves tearing then-Governor Mario Cuomo to shreds (both in English and Italian) and even wore T-shirts mocking the politician — would cement the station’s new identity in right-wing political commentary.

Following the path Grant laid WABC would go on to produce more broadcast icons like Rush Limbaugh in 1988 Sean Hannity in 1996 and Mark Levin who first did a Sunday show for free with the station in 2002.

Curtis Sliwa gets shot after going at the mob

In 1992 still-active talk show host and former GOP mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa was shot five times with hollow point rounds in the back of a cab — an attempted hit thought to be ordered by John Gotti Jr. in retribution for Sliwa talking about his father John Gotti Sr. who was on trial for murder and related organized-crime charges at the time.

While doing the “Angels in the Morning” show with his wife Lisa Evers Sliwa told The Post he “would critique” the trial despite being warned against it.

“The rest of the [competition] said ‘We’re not talking about the guy that’ll get ya killed early.’ They would all warn me” he said.

He was attacked by baseball-bat-wielding mobsters who broke his elbow on the Lower East Side in April 1992 “as a warning” he said.

But he got right back on air the next day talking about a murder allegedly committed by then-boss John Gotti Jr.

“Then on June 19th in 1992 as I was on my way to WABC to do the show boom! They shot me… I dive out of the back of the cab survive it and I’d say that was the most intense moment. It appeared I was dead.”

Still even the presumed work of La Cosa Nostra couldn’t keep the Guardian Angels founder off the air.

“I actually was broadcasting from Bellevue two weeks later with my wife Lisa.”

In 2005 Gotti Jr. went to trial on charges that included conspiracy and kidnapping of Sliwa though a mistrial was declared after jury deadlock. Gotti’s Gambino associate Michael Yannotti was also cleared on charges related to the shooting though he was given a 20-year sentence for a racketeering conviction.

9/11

The voices of WABC made it a mission to “try to make sense” of New York’s darkest day as the tragic attacks of September 11 unfurled Libertini said.

In the panic confusion and anger that came with the collapse of the Twin Towers WABC — like every news outlet — had been fielding information on the terror attack and gave near minute-by-minute updates on the status of New York and Washington DC.

Yet their coverage shifted to something much more personal. The station ultimately doubled as a lifeline where distraught family would go on air and call out for missing loved ones.

“We did a show for New York City everybody would call in. ‘I haven’t seen my husband I haven’t heard from him since 9 a.m.'” Libertini said. “Listeners shared the real real crazy things that they were going through. We would commiserate with them and be there for them.”

WABC’s approach of being a shoulder for New Yorkers to cry on throughout the despair was commended by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani — who now hosts a show on the station himself.

“WABC to me when I was the mayor was an arm of New York” Giuliani told The Post. “They were there to catch criminals… they were there to calm people during September 11.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Mi5kZWxvaXR0ZS5jb20vdXMvZW4vaW5zaWdodHMvdG9waWNzL2xlYWRlcnNoaXAvYm9hcmQtZWZmZWN0aXZlbmVzcy1jaGFpci1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Board effectiveness and board chairs,"Even with the return of in-person gatherings virtual meetings have demonstrated their usefulness and are clearly here to stay. Chairs must decide which works effectively under which conditions and double down on fundamentals to facilitate a successfully functioning board.

How chairs can lead moving forward

Chairs expect to capture what is effective from both options by adopting a hybrid model of virtual and in-person board meetings. For example chairs may use virtual meetings to discuss ongoing board business such as monitoring progress financial reporting and risks.

In-person meetings meanwhile may be devoted to topics involving the direction of the organization such as strategy climate and technology; important workforce matters such as diversity equity and inclusion; and executive pay. To make board and committee meetings as effective as possible chairs are constantly exploring how prereads and other materials can be deployed to help streamline agendas. Whatever the mix ultimately looks like chairs agreed they must strive to:

Challenge the agenda. Chairs say they are giving careful consideration to prereads and other materials handed to them by management. A chair recalled having served on previous boards where management “only made available what they wanted us to know.” Yet many chairs said they must also work to prevent information overload. Chairs may consider for example whether materials convey key information without unnecessary detail. “We have moved from a 450-page pack to under 100 pages” an East Africa chair said. “We are on a journey.”

To achieve consensus and trust chairs agreed they must work to ensure their boards operate in a respectful way. Some board colleagues may need to be encouraged . “Some directors are more forthcoming than others” said the chair of a Canadian firm. “And the ones who are not as forthcoming are always worth hearing because they bring a different point of view.” One way to draw out less vocal directors is to expand their responsibilities. The chair of a US company noted “When we have a director whose voice isn’t as strong in the boardroom as you might want one of the best things you can do is make that person chair of one of your committees. What happens is they take the bit in their teeth and they step up.”

To have a successful board whether in-person or virtually one of the most important qualities a chair can offer is the ability to build consensus. Chairs stressed that consensus doesn’t mean universal agreement on every subject; it means board members can speak freely and work together in an environment of trust. “We have to understand each other and we have to be able to speak as a board collectively” said the chair of one US company. “Because on governance matters [ultimately] decisions are going to be board decisions and not decisions made by the chair.” A chair from a company in Belgium added “After the debates the supervisory board needs to step outside with one voice.”

Chairs universally pointed to the value of assigning committees to work through technical or specialty issues sparing the wider board from being swamped by too much detail. Chairs in Italy for example said their committees debate and explore regulatory and governance themes including executive pay. Chairs in China also expect committees to play a bigger role in governance and talent retention among other areas. The chair of an Indian organization reported forming a digital transformation advisory council. Considering the range of issues facing boards and chairs today specialist committee or board advisory group work seems only likely to grow. At the same time chairs in Belgium identified a risk with committee proliferation: If too much gets shunted off to committees the full board may struggle to oversee key issues. “This is the main reason why an ESG committee has not been established—to ensure that the topic remains firmly on the board agenda” one chair explained. Other solutions have also been seen—for example many boards allow every board member to attend committee meetings should they wish.

Chairs help the board gel and evolve from a group of talented individuals into a successful team. Approaches may include having in-person or virtual social gatherings chairs said. “Zoom drinks” entered the board lexicon thanks to the pandemic. In particular chairs agreed that a strong welcoming induction for new directors is essential to build community and maintain continuity. Chairs across regions also said they welcomed independent board evaluations. A chair from South Africa for example noted that these evaluations reveal the strengths of individual directors and also create opportunities to replace underperformers. Ongoing board education is also a must and education must be targeted to specific needs and goals such as emerging issues likely to disrupt the industry. Before launching an education program chairs should consider “What are our gaps in knowledge at [the] committee and full board level?"" Chairs also highlighted the benefits of listening to the views of younger generations via ""reverse mentoring"" programs.

Chairs emphasized the importance of nurturing new members who may offer different perspectives from those of existing board members. While demographic diversity remains important diversity of thought and experiences are critical too. These skills include “an ability to inject creativity and different perspectives into strategy setting and decision-making” chairs in China noted. As the chair of one US company put it “It’s not just about diversity for diversity’s sake. You need to take a longer look at where the company is going in terms of its strategy and what skill sets that is going to demand.” And importantly a boardroom must be not just diverse; it needs to also be inclusive for everyone to feel able to speak up and share their perspectives and wisdom.

Nurturing talent on the board and beyond. This leads to the important question of what role chairs play in developing future talent on the board and across the organization. While advancement in technology may ease the pressure to some degree many chairs mentioned an intensifying war for talent connected to the “Great Resignation” of last year.4 Here chairs can help set the tone at the top for the best talent to join the organization—either on the board or further down the ranks of the company. “There’s also with respect to your talent a whole new notion of what does the future of work look like in my company how do you recruit and retain the best talent particularly when we are in an absolute war for talent right now” said the chair of a US company. Engaging with younger generations in the workforce is especially important here.

Advice for the chair of the future

Serving as an effective board chair has never been easy. Yet chairs are being asked to provide leadership and direction to an unprecedented degree. A key challenge is trying to “find the balance between supervising facilitating and acting as a sounding board” explained the chair of a Netherlands-based company. Different situations will call for all of those roles the chair advised “so work on your communication skills.”

Board chairs are being held accountable much more than before—by the public the media investors customers suppliers employees; and of course by regulators. Today’s chairs must walk a fine line between sometimes opposing choices. They should steer the longer-term strategic direction without overstepping; manage the board while encouraging debate and a multiplicity of views; support management while challenging their assumptions; and engage a wide range of stakeholders without being hijacked by every demand.

One chair of a Japanese firm noted “It is natural that short-term profits should be taken into account but to be a sustainable company it is more important to operate the boardroom from a longer-term perspective.” The chair of a UK company advised “Build a relationship with all stakeholders so you can discuss issues with them in difficult times.”

The following advice assembled from the collective wisdom of the chairs who participated may help provide a roadmap for the chair of the future.

Eight leading practices for being a board chair …

1. Build relationships. Create bonds with the board management stakeholders and especially with the CEO while also maintaining the independence of thought.

In their words (Belgium): “The relationship between chair and CEO needs to function. Only then can you realize an added value.”

2. Prioritize for the long term. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Understand and focus on what really matters.

In their words (Italy): “Often top management is focused on some stakeholders and on the short term; the chairman and the board must contribute to broadening the perspective and fostering a long-term vision.”

3. Understand the business. Chairs may struggle if they don’t know the many facets of the business its operations people competitive landscape and culture.

In their words (UK): “See and experience the business for yourself. Management reports are not always objective.”

4. Lead on purpose and values. Chairs must make tough and at times unpopular decisions in the long-term interest of the reputation of their organizations.

In their words (East Africa): “Be willing to stand alone if necessary.”

5. Be a learning leader. Confronted with many unknowns chairs must be comfortable asking for help continuing to learn and must lead a “learning board.”

In their words (New Zealand): “As a new or incoming chairperson regularly seek advice and feedback from other experienced members of the board and collect multiple points of view to form your own perspective.”

6. Nurture a broader skill set. Technical skills matter but so do emotional intelligence and the ability to draw out the best in others.

In their words (UK): “Be curious about what is happening in the world and why whether that be technology societal change or politics.”

7. Embrace diversity. Diversity in all its forms drives productive discussion and helps prevent groupthink.

In their words (India): “We need people with diversity of experience and skill sets who can adapt to the changing environment.”

8. Be a good listener. Adding value to the organization requires listening to those around you especially when opinions vary to allow views to be fully explored before drawing a consensus.

In their words (Germany): “Clear leadership is important but chairs should always be listening mediating with and involving stakeholders.”

… And five for becoming a chair

1. Be careful not to overcommit. Given the demands of serving as chair think seriously about the number of board appointments you accept.

In their words (Germany): “Do not underestimate the time and personal commitment that the serious exercise of this responsibility entails.”

2. Be realistic. This is a prestigious position but one that carries great responsibility. Be prepared to roll up your sleeves and work hard.

In their words (Ireland): “It’s a much tougher job than people think. You really need to immerse yourself especially in the beginning.”

3. Build your pathway. Most chairs have held other board positions prior to taking the leadership role.

In their words (East Africa): “My best learning has been from other seasoned board members and chairs listening and observing how they do it.”

4. Manage the transition from CEO to chair. If you have stepped up from CEO to chair the transition particularly of your mindset can be challenging especially for first-time chairs. This is something to watch especially in the rare circumstance of moving from CEO to chair within the same company.

In their words (East Africa): “The challenge is when you [still] want to be an executive yet you are [now] a nonexecutive chair.”

5. Find a mentor. Chairs are willing to support each other. Find someone who has already experienced the challenges to help you embrace your first chair role with confidence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhaW4uY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2hvdy11cC1hbmQtY29taW5nLWludmVzdG9ycy1hcmUtdXBlbmRpbmctdGhlLXdlYWx0aC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWJ1c2luZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Up-and-Coming Investors Are Upending the Wealth Management Business,"Banks aiming to outperform the market and create value in the coming years will find that wealth management could propel their business to the next level. Wealth management firms whether within banks or as standalone businesses have benefited from rising asset prices and a recent boom in investments. Morgan Stanley and UBS for example have boosted their business model through wealth management growth improving both capital efficiency and cost efficiency over the past decade.

Now the massive growth in young millionaires represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tap into a promising market (see Figure 1). Many of this burgeoning group (age 20 to 45) are underserved—including professionals (69% of the young cohort) entrepreneurs (22%) and the second or third generation of wealthy families (9%).

Figure 1 The ranks of the wealthy are swelling

What emerging clients value

Our interviews with members of this young affluent group reveal some important differences compared with established clientele. Among this cohort several priorities stand out with each respondent emphasizing some priorities more than others (see Figure 2).

Networking. The affluent younger generation tend to be digital natives who value contact not only with their relationship managers but also with a wider community of peers virtual and otherwise. Wealth management firms should invest in technologies that enable relationship managers to make more meaningful connections as well as technologies that facilitate wider networks and social investing for interested clients.

Wealth management firms should invest in technologies that enable relationship managers to make more meaningful connections as well as technologies that facilitate wider networks and social investing for interested clients. Exploring. Next-generation clients seek privileged access to novel deals or opportunities and nontraditional asset classes. In response firms will need to offer access to insights on a broad set of asset classes including cryptocurrency art and private equity.

Influencing. Growing and preserving wealth remains a core objective for younger affluent clients. But many say they also want to have a positive influence in society. For wealth management firms this requires evolving a trusted brand by embedding environmental social and governance elements alongside traditional financial elements.

Figure 2 Emerging clients emphasize a few priorities

Besides these attributes emerging clients also reject being squeezed into static categories traditionally used by wealth managers. They want to select the appropriate channel service level or investment to suit the particular situation. Dynamic segmentation informed by real-time behavioral data will become an important capability for firms to develop.

Not there yet

No contender whether bank brokerage or wealthtech company has delivered an ideal end-to-end experience for this emerging segment just yet. For one thing emerging clients’ willingness to pay and banks’ cost to serve are out of whack.

Beyond that broad disparity customers we interviewed raised other concerns. They noted that information on many wealth manager websites was fragmented and lacked easily digestible market updates tailored to their portfolios. Advisers could be difficult to reach. Moreover many of the firms fell short on services such as tax optimization insurance coverage or estate planning.

Affluent customers give wealth management firms a broad range of Net Promoter Scores (a key metric of loyalty and advocacy) at each stage from research to getting advice investing and account management an NPS Prism® survey shows (see Figure 3).

Three viable routes to daylight

Can the wealth management industry rise to the occasion?

Wealthtech firms for their part attracted a record amount of investor funding in 2021. These challengers have ample technical capabilities. But they struggle to attain the same massive customer bases as incumbent firms and improve their per-customer economics. Brand equity still matters and customer acquisition costs remain high. Yet incumbents and wealthtech firms working together possess the required capabilities to win over emerging segments.

Making the transition to a digitally enabled model will be a significant challenge in the coming years. For ambitious and committed companies there are three viable paths to build up the necessary assets and capabilities.

End-to-end in-house. This model is hard to get right. It relies on building a new platform or enhancing the existing platform through in-house development. It demands dedicated teams with all the requisite capabilities and corresponding budgets. For many companies that are not already well positioned in hybrid advice past internal efforts to build the capability have proven largely ineffective.

Consider the disappointing results of many in-house robo-advice efforts. UBS reconsidered its robo adviser SmartWealth and eventually sold the technology to wealth management start-up SigFig; Investec closed its robo adviser after just two years; and ABN Amro shuttered its German online wealth manager Prospery. Following initial excitement for a new breed of highly scalable robo advisers their growth never lived up to lofty expectations. As it turned out clients mostly shunned digital-only propositions preferring hybrid alternatives instead. In addition the cultural shift required for a start-up-like effort often did not materialize.

A few years later wealthtech is back with a vengeance but in a different guise. Rather than developing their propositions in-house many incumbent wealth managers see partnering with challenger wealthtech firms as a more viable path to success.

Wealthtech acquisitions. To leapfrog competitors some banks aim to accelerate their delivery of digitally enhanced advice and brokerage through acquisitions. With the acquisition of E*Trade in 2020 Morgan Stanley moved to shore up its digital capabilities. In 2021 JPMorgan acquired UK-based digital wealth manager Nutmeg with more than 140000 customers and about $4.9 billion in assets under management. As the integrations are still in early stages it remains to be seen how the business and operating models will evolve.

Other acquisitions are designed for expansion into new regions with a scalable investment offering. UBS paid $1.4 billion for Wealthfront in order to accelerate growth in the US and boost digital capabilities to cater to the younger generation.

From the perspective of wealthtech firms these partnerships promise a path to profitability building on the trusted brand product shelf and research and established customer base of incumbent companies.

For any merging companies forging an integrated model poses strategic and operational challenges. Even the combined capabilities of an incumbent and a challenger will rarely offer a perfect solution so specialized partners will have to fill the gaps (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Partnerships help wealth management companies start to fill capability gaps

Moreover the price tag of a large acquisition must be weighed against the potential benefits which might only materialize in the long term.

A modular platform. There is an alternative to building an integrated wealthtech proposition in-house or making acquisitions. Incumbents may tap an expanding ecosystem of wealthtech providers in order to address specific capability gaps one at a time. While integrating them seamlessly remains a challenge the advent of cloud-native anything-as-a-service offerings now makes modular adaptable architectures feasible.

This route avoids the hurdles of internal development as well as the risk and cost of high-stakes acquisitions. Partnerships with wealthtech firms and other external partners open up opportunities. Launching a new scalable digital wealth management platform that targets affluent individuals is possible in a short time frame if the team can operate independently and has the right incentives.

Goldman Sachs for instance is building on its current strengths in the ultra-high-net-worth segment while tackling lower tiers of the wealth scale through Marcus its innovative digital retail offering. In doing so the bank is also developing a portfolio of growth options in wealth management. Goldman has highlighted the need to selectively build partner or buy in order to create a scalable modular platform. Unlike some competitors it has shown limited appetite for large-scale deals. One goal of such a modular platform is to lower the cost to serve various customer segments and make the bank more adaptable in focusing on client needs.

Questions to inform the next steps

Combining the assets and capabilities of established firms and wealthtech innovators still leaves gaps that will need to be filled. To address them it’s useful to ask a set of high-gain questions that will clarify the vision of the future state and deal with specific hindrances along the path.

Which client segments do we want to serve? If there are several which are the highest priority?

What do these customers value what do they need and how will we appeal to them?

What capabilities are essential to serve these segments? For the capabilities where we are weak how will we obtain or develop them?

Which strategic assets do we possess (such as a brand distribution network or customer base) that give us a competitive edge?

Which internal processes and competencies do we need in order to deliver the right proposition? And which external partners would help us accelerate to get there?

Where should we start with a pilot to test and learn?

While the market for wealth management is flourishing the next few years won’t offer easy straight-line growth. The mix of affluent clients is changing rapidly and they have needs and priorities that many wealth management firms have just begun to sort out. Gaining a deep understanding of those priorities and developing a business that addresses them effectively will be essential to creating value from the new surge in demand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZGJhbmsub3JnL2VuL2V2ZW50cy8yMDIyLzA4LzE4L2FmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXBlcnNpc3RzLXByaXZhdGUtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1yZWNvdmVyeS1zY2FsZS11cC1pbml0aWF0aW5nLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLXRyYW5zaXRpb25hbC1zb2x1dGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Afghanistan PERSISTS (Private Enterprise Recovery Scale-up & Initiating Sustainable Transitional Solutions),"The events of August 2021 in Afghanistan triggered a political economic and humanitarian crisis that disrupted functioning of the government and non-government institutions contracted economic activities and resulted in severe fiscal shrinkage for businesses and households.

ALBUQUERQUE N.M. – Albuquerque police said at least 90 units were burglarized at Otter Self Storage Sunday. Officials are still in the process of notifying everyone affected.

Alice Webb said she was out of town when she found out through the Nextdoor app.



“I saw somebody was alerting everybody that the Otter Self Storage unit north of Lomas on San Pedro had been broken into and homeless were living here and was really trashed out and everything” she said. “So I came over.”



She said she was worried about the thousands of dollars worth of artwork in her unit.



“I’m secure” she said while checking her lock which was thankfully still intact. “I’m so happy I’m secure.”



Frances Kilpatrick’s friend was not so lucky.

“Her lock was cut” she said. “There was trash around lights were on many units had been broken into.”



A third woman sent us a video of a unit piled high with debris trash and clothing even buckets used to collect human waste.

A second video shows an electrical cord running from the ceiling into another unit.



Everyone KOB 4 spoke with said they tried calling Otter Self Storage but have not been helped. Our crew tried calling the number painted on the front of the building but the line was out of service.

We tried calling a second number that was posted on a Google Review for the company. A representative answered and told our crew Otter Self Storage does not have any representatives based in New Mexico. They also said all calls go straight to the corporate office in Illinois.



When asked about the recent break-in the representative said the company is aware of the incident and does not have a comment at this time.



A spokesperson with APD said the department has responded to three other burglaries at Otter Self Storage this year. As for the incident on Sept. 4 officers were investigating reports of a suspicious person. When they arrived APD said multiple suspects took off in a white Chevy truck.

The county's public works department hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday in front of the County Health Agency Administration Building where the battery storage unit was installed.

The battery can store up to 31 hours of electricity which can provide resilience against power outages public works officials said.

""When there is a power outage the facility will now be able to use the battery energy storage to supply electricity to keep these sites online"" Annie Secrest SLO County Department of Public Works' Energy and Water Coordinator said. ""This means the critical public health services that these facilities provide to the community will be able to continue.""

It can also be used during peak demand periods when electricity prices are highest according to Cindy Treichler Deputy Directory of SLO County Department of Public Works.

The battery can be recharged and is expected to last for 20 years. Public works officials projected that the battery storage unit can save the county $800000 in its lifespan.

The battery storage unit was installed at zero cost to residents. The installation was entirely funded by the State of California Public Utilities Commission’s Self Generation Incentive Program.

The county also partnered with Tesla Inc. which reached out to different public agencies including the county for partnership soon after the state program was initiated said Secrest.

The department plans to install more battery storage units in other locations.

The county plans to begin construction on two sites along the Nacimiento pipeline to support its pump stations later this year Secrest said. Another project at the Lopez Water Treatment Plant is awaiting permission to operate.

Since its release in 1981 the movie Silence of the Lambs has become a horror icon. The American Film Institute considers it one of the best films of all time and it is only one of three movies to win the “big five” Academy Awards for Best Actor Actress Director Movie and Screenplay.

In a movie filled with terrifying moments there is one that stands out. While investigating a storage facility FBI Agent Clarice Starling finds a large jar that contains a human head. The gruesome sight horrified the agent not to mention the audience.

While discovering a head in a jar might be the stuff of movies finding human remains in storage units is not unrealistic. Dozens of such cases have happened around the world to people who never imagined seeing a tiny corpse stuffed into a suitcase or a military hero’s ashes on a shelf. From murders to thefts accidents to suicides gruesome crime scenes to sadly forgotten histories storage units have many stories to tell. Here are ten of them.

2 children’s bodies found in suitcases bought at auction police in New Zealand say

Watch this video on YouTube

The idea of finding something valuable in an abandoned storage unit has made TV shows like Storage Wars and Auction Hunters popular. In those shows as in real life if a storage unit goes unpaid or has been abandoned the owners of the facility can auction off its contents. The bidders don’t know what they might find—it might be valuable art or jewelry; it might be nothing but empty boxes. And sometimes as in a recent case in New Zealand it might be something horrific.

On August 11 2022 after trying their luck by bidding on abandoned storage items in an online auction a family in Auckland brought home their unknown winnings. They hoped to find something of value. What they found instead crammed into suitcases were the remains of two young children between roughly five and ten years of age.

Authorities were called to the scene and investigators say the remains have likely been in the suitcases for several years. Although their names have not been released the children have been identified. After a South Korean woman was linked to the victims the Korean National Police Agency became involved in the ongoing investigation.[1]

In another horrific case involving a child the remains of five-year-old Cali Anderson were found in a plastic drum in a Sacramento storage unit in May 2018. The police say Cali had died approximately two weeks before her body was discovered. In an arrest affidavit Anderson’s stepmother said the little girl was experiencing health problems but since she wasn’t her own child she didn’t get her any medical attention.

When Cali died her body was placed in a duffel bag hidden in a closet and finally moved to the storage unit. When the police investigated the child’s home they found handcuffs in an animal crate along with clothing belonging to the girl hinting that little Cali’s short life had been a very tragic one.[2]

Police Continue to Investigate Embattled Funeral Home

While storage units have been used many times by killers trying to hide evidence sometimes the remains are of people who died of completely natural causes. The crimes perpetrated against them and their families instead occurred after death by the very people trusted to handle their remains with dignity and care.

In one such case the winner of a storage auction in Rhode Island was shocked to find the bodies of two adults and one infant in his unit. The remains of the adults were so decomposed their gender could not be determined while the infant found in a small coffin was thought to be a female. The unit had been rented by funeral home operator Alfred Pennine of Providence. Dozens more sets of remains were discovered in the funeral home he operated. Once his crimes began to come to light Pennine committed suicide.[3]

7 A Long-Overdue Honor

In some cases it is not criminal activity that results in human remains being found in storage but merely time and tragedy. In early 2022 storage auction winner Bob Blank stumbled across the story of a forgotten military veteran. While looking through items he had won from the auction he found a sealed box with cremated remains along with other documents including a letter from former President Ronald Reagan. A death certificate and Army discharge documents said the remains belonged to a World War II veteran. Two medals indicated he had been a heroic one.

Decorated soldier George Ralph Brady died in 1984 at the age of 59 and his ashes were stored in a cardboard box for 38 years. Determining that Brady had no living relatives the American Legion performed a burial service with an honor guard and a flag line. The once-forgotten veteran’s remains now lie at the Riverside National Cemetery in California.[4]

6 Work Goes up in Flames

Although most people use storage units to secure their personal belongings some also use them to work on their own property. Unfortunately for a man in Russellville Alabama doing repairs on an automobile might have been responsible for his death.

On January 14 2022 emergency workers responded to a fire at a storage facility. Initial reports about the number of units involved varied but they all claimed one thing: that a dead body was found inside one of them. Subsequent reports said the unnamed man was known to have rented several units in the facility and that he often worked on vehicles in them. Authorities speculate the victim might have been using an alternative heat source that could have sparked the blaze. No foul play was suspected.[5]

5 Murderous Greed

Man accused of hiding bodies of elderly couple in trash cans for years

Money has always been a powerful motivator for murder and hiding a victim’s remains while continuing to rob them is not as rare as one would hope. In one such case in Las Vegas the bodies of an elderly couple were hidden in trash bins for ten years while their killer stole their Social Security income. The remains were found in a unit at All Storage at the Lakes in 2015 but the last time Joaquin and Eleanor Sierra were seen alive was in 2003.

Their killer Robert Dixon Dunn had apparently met them at a nursing home where his own mother was living. After killing them he succeeded in stealing from them for all those years by moving around the country and using a fake name. After someone reported him for suspected fraud he was finally caught. His ex-wife said Dunn claimed he was concealing the bodies of his aunt and uncle who had committed suicide. In truth the bodies were found to contain drugs and injuries caused by a sharp object.[1]

SOLVED: The “Witch” Who Almost Got Away With Murder

That lure of money does not just attract evil strangers to potential victims. Violence within families is not uncommon sometimes between spouses or between siblings. And sometimes between parents and children. In 2001 police in Las Vegas accused Brookey Lee West of killing her own mother and hiding the remains in a trash can in a storage unit. The remains of Christine Smith 68 were discovered after reports of a foul odor caused the police to seek a search warrant.

The unit which also contained many of Smith’s belongings had been rented by her daughter though she had used a different last name. During the trial it seemed possible the murderer might evade justice because the remains were so decomposed that the coroner could not determine a cause of death. West said her mother died of natural causes and the coroner could not absolutely refute that. But in a surprising twist an entomologist was able to prove the case for murder. Dr. Neal Haskell testified that the absence of blow flies on the corpse proved she had been put in the can either while she was still alive or immediately after death. West was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.

In an interesting footnote Brookey Lee West returned to the headlines when she tried to escape from prison. Although wearing a disguise West was spotted and recognized by staff right before she reached the prison exit.[7]

3 A Daughter’s Deceptive Plan

Even when murder is not involved the lure of money can cause some people to do unimaginable things. After her father apparently died from natural causes in June 1990 Judith Maria Broughton concocted a plan to steal his Social Security benefits beginning in 1997. Leasing a storage unit at Econo Self Storage in Lexington Kentucky Judith stored the body there and kept collecting her father’s retirement funds.

On January 8 2014 authorities discovered the mummified remains of Luther Broughton and charged Judith with the theft of nearly a quarter-million dollars. After pleading guilty to the theft Judith was sentenced to ten years in prison.[8]

2 Horrific Hoarding

It’s not always murder and it’s not always money. Sometimes remains discovered in storage units were kept there due to family secrets psychological disorders and grief. After her death by natural causes in 1995 Ann Bunch’s body was released to her family for burial. Family members built a casket domed so the old woman’s hump would fit inside. It was painted blue and loaded into a family van to be transported to Alabama for burial. But the body never got there.

On her deathbed Ann’s daughter Barbie Hancock confessed to her own daughter Rebecca Fancher that the remains were in unit B8 of U-Stor. Although Hancock claimed the burial had been delayed because of bad weather and truck problems family members say otherwise. Fancher’s ex-husband claims his former mother-in-law couldn’t deal with her mother’s death and that her hoarding compulsion made her keep the body nearby—possibly even in her own home before it was moved to U-Stor. Hancock and Fancher’s hoarding eventually led to their house being declared uninhabitable.[9]

One of the most disturbing instances of remains found in a storage unit would have to be the case of Jessica Rey. On October 20 2017 Rey gave birth in a Kansas City Missouri hotel room. Her husband Justin claims she died after the child’s birth saying at one time that she had committed suicide and at another that Jessica died of natural causes. In any case Justin spent two days in the room with the corpse the newborn infant and the couple’s toddler. Then in the presence of his children he dismembered Jessica’s body put the parts in a cooler and took it to a U-Haul storage facility. Alarmed by his suspicious behavior facility workers called the police.

Authorities found Rey in the storage unit—where he might have stayed for a few nights—with his two small children and his wife’s dismembered remains. Faced with charges of endangerment of a child and sexual exploitation of a minor for photos found on his phone during the investigation Rey was convicted and sentenced to nearly nine years in prison. He remains under investigation in a separate murder case in California.[10]

According to police officers caught the man and woman in a storage unit that did not belong to them. They say they don’t know if they are the ones who broke into the facility or if they came along later and took advantage of the situation.

Police said they found dozens of storage units burglarized from all four aisles of the facility but it’s unclear exactly what was taken.

A woman with items at the facility said it is the second time a break-in has recently occurred. She said she recently tried to take her stuff out but the storage place hired security who wouldn’t let her inside.

SAPD officers on scene confirmed there was another break-in just a month ago. It’s unclear if there were any arrests in that case.

This is a developing story. Stay with KSAT 12 both online and on-air for more information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbm9maWxtc2Nob29sLmNvbS93aWxsLWZ1bGwtZnJhbWUtc29ueS1mcjctZm9yZXZlci1jaGFuZ2UtcHR6LWNhbWVyYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the Full Frame Sony FR7 Forever Change PTZ Cameras?,"While the PTZ format has been relegated to security live events and sometimes for creative projects the pan tilt and zoom cameras from which the name is derived seem to be an underutilized tool in the filmmaking landscape.

Sony happened to agree and has now released the ILME-FR7 the world’s first PTZ camera with a full-frame sensor. At least as of Sept. 6 2022. While we don’t usually cover PTZ cameras what Sony has released made us change our minds a bit.

But who is this camera for? Is your local Public Storage going to buy a bunch of these so you can watch your stuff being stolen with a razor-thin depth of field? Let’s dive deep to find out!

Old Camera New Disguise

The Sony FR7 as we’re calling it for short is the latest addition to Sony’s cinema line. With it it’s bringing a back-illuminated 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with about 10.3 effective megapixels. Sony also stated an expanded ISO of up to 409600 and has measured about 15+ stops of dynamic range when recording in S-Log3. There’s also a built-in electronically controlled variable ND filter.

As with the new Sony FX3 update creatives will also get S-Cinetone and the new Cine EI mode. If you’re still working with older formats the FR7 will still shoot the original S-Log3 gamma wide S-Gamut3 and S-Gamut3.Cine color spaces.

Creatives can record internally in XAVC (with metadata) or externally in RAW via SDI and compatible recorders. Speaking of ports the camera comes with HDMI Type A and 12G-SDI connectors as well as Timecode In Genlock a 5-pin XLR audio in port and an optical output for long transmission. The FR7 also comes with dual media slots from CFexpress Type A and SDXC memory cards.

There’s also an E-mount for all your favorite Sony lenses and creatives can also shoot up to 120fps 4K and 240 fps FHD.

If you feel like Sony just slapped an FX3 on some PTZ motors we had the same thought. But you have some interesting options for composition and connectivity.

Pan Tilt Zoom in Full Frame

There’s now a dedicated web application for creatives to control pan tilt zoom focus record playback and camera settings from either a tablet or computer web browser. At the same time stakeholders or other creatives can monitor the footage either from a single source or from multiple cameras at once.

Much like a traditional camera you can mount the Sony FR7 on a tripod. However you can also stick it to the ceiling small nooks and crannies or even onto moving vehicles.

Because zooming will be handled by E-mount lenses creatives will also get Sony’s hybrid autofocus which has eye autofocus and real-time tracking.

When moving the camera around filmmakers will have variable pan and tilt speeds from 0.02 degrees per second to 60 degrees per second. This ranges from -170° to +170° for the panning and -30° to +195° when tilting.

If you're worried about doing everything manually the FR7 can store up to 100 camera position presets which can be recalled from the web application or the optional RM-IP500 remote controller.

So Who’s This For?

Honestly we don't know. The FR7 isn’t something for your everyday filmmaker. With what Sony put into this camera it’s a bit overkill for security purposes. Also because it has a full-frame sensor even Sony’s 600mm telephoto lens won’t have the reach you’d usually expect with the usual 1-inch sensor that PTZ cameras have. This makes the FR7 a hard sell for sporting events that really need the reach.

I think this new camera is Sony pulling a niche technology format into new creative spaces by bridging the gap between PTZ and its cinema standard.

Think of dangerous stunt work for example. A PTZ camera would allow operators to stay away from dangerous sequences or explosions and give them a lot more freedom for composition. What about car commercials? The FR7 could replace rigs that are 10 times the price. Even live music events would get an extra cinematic punch in their coverage.

For Sony it seems that any footage should be “cinematic” footage.

Or maybe there’s some rich billionaire who just wants to keep an eye on his property in full-frame RAW.

All we know is that this push from Sony gives us a lot to think about in terms of what a camera could be. But the question we should be asking is... should they? From my humble perspective that’s a big fat yes. The more we evolve camera technology the more tools filmmakers will have.

What project would you want to use this camera on? Let us know what you think in the comments!

Refreshing the company’s longstanding 600 and 400 series of chips Qualcomm is announcing the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1. Both SoCs are receiving similar spec bumps incorporating newer and faster IP blocks from Qualcomm – such as Arm Cortex-A78 derived CPU cores – as well as moving to newer more contemporary manufacturing processes.

The Snapdragon 600/400 lineups were last updated in mid and early 2021 respectively so as Qualcomm is already preparing for 2023 the time has finally come to update the bottom half of their product stack. Following Qualcomm’s broad cascading IP strategy this generation of parts sees both SoC lineups align around Cortex-A78 CPUs for their main CPU cores and in the case of the 6 Gen 1 doubling the number of high-performance CPU cores. Both SoCs also come with faster Adreno GPUs though in traditional Qualcomm fashion the company isn’t offering much in the way of details on the underlying hardware there.

Notably however Qualcomm’s 2023 mid-range/low-end parts aren’t making the jump to the Armv9 architecture. Unlike the 8 Gen 1 and 7 Gen 1 which incorporated Arm’s new Armv9 cores Qualcomm’s cascading development strategy means that the 6 and 4 series will remain a bit farther behind the curve. For end users this should have little significance for the moment but for smartphone vendors and software developers it does mean Qualcomm won’t complete the Armv9 transition for at least another generation.

Meanwhile coming up on nearly a year since Qualcomm announced their initial Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC today’s announcement from Qualcomm brings their remaining smartphone SoC families in alignment with their new product branding strategy. The 6 and 4 series pick up from where the 600 and 400 series left off respectively resetting the counted with the inaugural Gen 1 parts. Like the rest of simplified “Gen” series this also means that Qualcomm is doing away with individual model numbers for its Kyro/Hexagon/Adreno/Spectra blocks obfuscating a bit what generation of IP Qualcomm is using there.

Snapdragon 6 Gen 1

Starting things off we have the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1. Built on an unidentified 4nm process (Qualcomm hasn’t specified whether it’s Samsung or TSMC though the former is more likely) it replaces the outgoing Snapdragon 695. And in the process delivers some major updates to the CPU camera memory and modem blocks.

The biggest news this year is arguably that Qualcomm has rearranged the CPU core configuration for their mid-range SoC lineup. Whereas previous 6-series used a 2+6 configuration with two high-performance (Cortex-A7x) cores and 6 high-efficiency (Cortex-A5x) cores 6 Gen 1 shifts this over to a 4+4 configuration very similar to what Qualcomm already does for the 8 and 7 series. The net result is that the 6 Gen 1 should offer significantly better multi-threaded CPU performance than its predecessor with Qualcomm touting a 40% improvement. Meanwhile single-threaded performance should remain largely unchanged as Qualcomm is using the same Cortex-A78s at the same 2.2GHz peak frequency as was found in the Snapdragon 965. Otherwise it will be interesting to see what the larger number of performance cores means for the 6 Gen 1’s battery life as these cores are going to be (relatively) more power hungry.

On the GPU side of matters Qualcomm isn’t saying much about the Adreno GPU block used here. With that said the explicit mention of variable rate shading support does imply that it’s from a newer generation of Qualcomm’s GPU IP as the feature was not available on the Snapdragon 695. Qualcomm’s claims of an (up to) 35% GPU performance improvement also hint at a more significant update to their GPU.

Feeding the SoC is an LPDDR5-capable memory controller bringing that down to a 6-series chip for the first time. The maximum frequency supported here is slightly lower than Qualcomm’s higher-end SoCs at LPDDR5-5500 which combined with the 32-bit memory bus nets a total of 22GB/second of memory bandwidth. This works out to a roughly 29% increase in memory bandwidth.

Qualcomm has also updated their Hexagon DSP/AI block for their latest 6-series chip. The unnamed version of the IP is one of Qualcomm’s “7th generation” designs meaning that along with vector and scalar processing it also includes tensor processing capabilities that are chiefly aimed at speeding up AI inference.

As for the camera/ISP Qualcomm is still using a triple 12-bit ISP here with some modest performance improvements in terms of pixel throughput. The big news here is the (re)introduction of HDR support for the 6-series with Qualcomm supporting computational HDR on this class of SoC for the first time. As a result the 6 Gen 1 can handle 4K HDR video recording at up to 30fps.

Last but not least Qualcomm has also significantly upgraded the wireless capabilities of the SoC both for cellular and Wi-Fi communications. On the cellular side of matters the chip integrates a Snapdragon X62-class modem supporting both sub-6 and mmWave bands. Qualcomm isn’t providing a detailed breakout of transfer speeds but on paper the modem can achieve downloads as fast as 2.9Gbps over 5G. Meanwhile the Wi-Fi radio has undergone a long-overdue upgrade replacing Qualcomm’s dated Wi-Fi 5 FastConnect 6200 radio with a more modern Wi-Fi 6E radio based on their FastConnect 6700 IP.

Of today’s two SoC announcements the 6 Gen 1 is the more forward looking of the two. According to Qualcomm we should see handsets using the new SoC show up in the first quarter of 2023 approximately four to six months from now.

Snapdragon 4 Gen 1

Meanwhile bringing up the entry-level segment of Qualcomm’s SoCs is the new Snapdragon 4 Gen 1. Unlike its 6 Gen 1 counterpart Qualcomm isn’t as extensively updating this chip but the 4 Gen 1 should still deliver some modest improvements over its predecessor the Snapdragon 480.

On the CPU front the 4 Gen 1 is getting the same Cortex-A78 upgrade as the 6 Gen 1 pairing the cores with Cortex-A55 cores in a 2+6 configuration. In terms of architectural improvements this is actually a bigger step up here than it was for the 6 Gen 1 as the Snapdragon 4 series previous used Cortex-A76 cores here. Still with CPU frequencies still capped at 2.0GHz all of the performance gains will have to come sole from the CPU architectural improvements. Overall Qualcomm is touting a 15% improvement in CPU performance.

As for the GPU the 4 Gen 1 gets an unnamed Adreno GPU block. This is again a more modest upgrade with Qualcomm promoting an (up to) 10% increase in GPU performance. But as Qualcomm isn’t upgrading the memory controller – the 4 Gen 1 still uses LPDDR4X-4266 memory on a 32-bit bus – there aren’t any memory bandwidth improvements to feed a significantly faster GPU anyhow.

The camera/ISP block for the new 4-series SoC is also quite similar to its predecessor with Qualcomm employing a triple 12-bit ISP. The notable improvement here is that Qualcomm has significantly increased the maximum photo resolution to 108MP almost doubling the number of pixels that can be captured in a single shot and in the process matching what the more powerful 6-series SoCs can do.

Meanwhile in a sign that mmWave adoption in handsets isn’t as high as Qualcomm initially planned the 4 Gen 1’s wireless suite ends up being a regression of sorts. The 5G Snapdragon X51 modem ends up dropping mmWave support leaving just support for the sub-6 bands .

Update (09/06): Qualcomm has sent a note over this afternoon stating that while mmWave does not appear in the spec sheets for Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 the hardware does still support the tech. So mmWave is available to any handset manufacturers that wished to support it. With that said given the low prices expected by the intended market handset manufacturers are likely to have little appetite for including the necessary mmWave antenna modules – and is likely why Qualcomm didn't bother to list it as a feature.

But even without mmWave appearing in these budget phones this is enough to drive download speeds of up to 2.5Gbps and supported upload speeds are now as high as 900Mbps. The Wi-Fi radio remains similarly unchanged with Qualcomm using a Wi-Fi 5 + Bluetooth 5.2 radio based on their FastConnect 6200 IP.

Finally the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is being fabbed on TSMC’s 6nm process making it the latest Qualcomm SoC line to be shifted over to TSMC from rival Samsung. According to Qualcomm handsets based on the SoC will be shipping imminently with devices slated to become available in the remainder of this quarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvcXVhbGNvbW0tdW52ZWlscy1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTYtYW5kLTQtZ2VuLTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Unveils Snapdragon 6 And 4 Gen 1 Platforms To Supercharge Midrange Devices,"Click To Enlarge

Today Qualcomm is introducing the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 and Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 Mobile Platforms. These SoCs follow the new naming conventions introduced with the company’s flagship 8-series starting with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 . Qualcomm has designed these 6-series and 4-series processors for the mid-tier and mass-volume markets.The Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 is focused on bringing improved image capture capabilities and smoother gaming to midrange devices. The SoC integrates three image signal processors—the Spectra Triple ISP—which allows devices to capture from three cameras at once. This has applications for computational photography including support for staggered HDR image sensors for the first time in the 6-series. The system also supports high resolution sensors up to 108 MP and incorporates AI De-Noising (AIDE) to improve the appearance of low-light images.The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 (SM6450) is built on a 4nm process which offers significantly improved computational performance compared to the Snapdragon 695 5G. Qualcomm specifies an improvement of up to 35% quicker graphics rendering by the Adreno GPU and up to 40% faster processing by the Kryo CPU over its predecessor. It claims this is suitable to deliver 60 frames per second or more in HDR gaming titles with high-quality visuals and real-time responses. We do not typically think of midrange processors for high-end mobile gaming but Qualcomm has made a concerted effort to improve the experience since the introduction of the Snapdragon 730G in 2019.Qualcomm further enhances gaming with a few other capabilities. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 supports Variable Rate Shading . This is a technique that allows the GPU to apply different rendering performance to different areas of the frame. Low focus areas do not need as much attention and can get away with less detail to optimize limited compute resources. The SoC also features Qualcomm’s upgraded Jank Reducer v2.0 and Color Plus 2.0 for a more fluid and vibrant gaming experience. It supports displays up to FHD+ with a 120 Hz refresh rate.The SoC includes Qualcomm’s 7th generation AI Engine with Hexagon Tensor Accelerator to improve AI performance offloaded from the CPU. Qualcomm indicates this is capable of 3x improved AI performance compared to the Snapdragon 695 5G. The system supports the always-on Qualcomm Sensing Hub for tasks like AI-based activity tracking to make suggestions based on contextual clues. It further incorporates the Snapdragon X62 5G model with FastConnect 6700 Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity to keep users in touch.On the mass-volume front the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 (SM4375) is geared towards improving everyday experiences using a 6nm process. It supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4+ Technology which can fuel up to half of a device’s battery capacity in 15 minutes. The Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 promises up to 15% Kryo CPU performance and up to 10% Adreno GPU performance over the Snapdragon 480 5G platform. Qualcomm claims it can handle some AAA titles at high framerates with minimal frame drops.The Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 borrows some of the new 6-series photography capabilities. It is similarly capable of capturing from up to three cameras simultaneously at 13 MP and 30 FPS without slowing down. It alternatively supports a single 108 MP image capture and uses Multi-Frame Noise Reduction (MFNR) to improve low light images.The new 4-series processor also incorporates the Qualcomm AI Engine with Hexagon Vector eXtensions (HVX) to offload CPU tasks. It uses the always-on capabilities to accelerate voice assistant functions perform voice detection and offer echo cancellation with background noise suppression. The Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is 5G enabled with the X51 modem and supports Wi-Fi 5 2x2 with Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity.The Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is expected to be available in devices starting this year in Q3. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 will begin to see commercial availability in Q1 of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcG9ja2V0bm93LmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbS1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTYtZ2VuLTEtYW5kLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tNC1nZW4tMS1zb2Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 and 4 Gen 1 Qualcomm is aiming for mid-tier domination,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcG9ja2V0bm93LmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbS1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTYtZ2VuLTEtYW5kLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tNC1nZW4tMS1zb2Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

DENVER — The nonprofit organization known for more than 40 years as 9Health Fair announced a new name and expanded preventative health services on Tuesday.

“9Health Fair’s legacy and deep connection to the community first established 43 years ago remains but our expansion of preventative services resources and tools moves us beyond just hosting health fairs in an effort to help Coloradans stay healthy 365 days a year and the name 365 Health better represents our expanded mission” said CEO Gary Drews in a news release.

365 Health will still hold health fairs and 9NEWS remains the nonprofit’s media sponsor. In addition the nonprofit is introducing Health in Hand a resource for individuals businesses nonprofits and employees to reduce out-of-pocket health care costs.

Health in Hand will cost $99 per year and will provide unlimited access to nonemergency text-first telehealth advice and information from licensed primary mental health and psychiatry physicians via CirrusMD. Users also get an annual blood screening and year-round health education support.

The goal is to provide accessible and equitable preventive health services that bridge health-care gaps for underserved and health-conscious Colorado residents.

“Many Coloradans postponed or skipped their preventive health care due to COVID-19 and we continue to see a drop-off in preventive care and screenings as compared to before the pandemic” Drews said.

Other 365 Health services resources and tools include:

Low-cost preventive health screenings at more than 30 Quest Diagnostics Lab Patient Centers throughout Colorado with no doctor’s visit or insurance needed.

Clinics for flu and COVID-19 vaccines for vulnerable and underserved communities in partnership with Safeway and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

Free online health assessments information videos and tools to help individuals understand health risks to navigate the health care system and to find local health resources.

“Preventative health care and screenings are vital to maintaining good health avoiding future problems or catching them early when they’re easier to treat” Drews said. “With health care’s rising costs our free and affordable health services are a necessary resource for those who may lack access or who have high deductible insurance plans or no insurance at all.”

If you’ve been here for a while you’ll be up-to-date with Chris Pine’s current dandy style.

If you haven’t you might think that Chris is copying Brad Pitt’s tech CEO style but I feel that Chris’ style is more elevated than that and the only real comparison that can be made is that they have similar hairstyles.

For the photocall the actor wore a Giuliva Heritage Fall 2022 suit which feels thrown together in a very laissez-faire way but I love how eclectic and impeccable this look is.

It reads quintessential English professor at Oxford.

Giuliva Heritage Fall 2022

For the premiere the actor wore a brown and cream Ralph Lauren suit with Rayban shades Christian Louboutin Cousin Dand loafers and Montblanc cufflinks.

I love the colour coordination and his overall attitude.

Perhaps five years ago this would’ve been a more traditional navy or black suit but his current style seems to have moved away from that and to be honest it would’ve been out of place on this red carpet like Adam Driver on the ‘House of Gucci’ promo tour.

He’s an ambitious force. And he clearly isn’t afraid to shake things up.

An industry veteran Robinson started his career in retail with Cabot House in New England before moving to the wholesale side as a sales rep for Universal Furniture and Craftmaster. Robinson flourished increasing sales opening accounts with top 100 customers and winning multiple sales awards.

He moved to Theodore Alexander in 2014 as vice president of sales before being promoted to the role of president of North America. Robinson showed no signs of slowing down doubling Theodore Alexander’s upholstery business launching new licenses with Alexa Hampton and Ralph Lauren Home and ramping up the company’s trade business.

Since early 2021 he’s been leading the charge at Legacy Classic|Modern. He has worked to reposition the company as a reputable and complete source for classic and modern furniture. He has helped add multiple top 100 customers and boosted the company’s stock position in the U.S.

Robinson described his leadership style as inclusive.

“Inclusive would be a good word” he told Furniture Today. “An effective leader in the furniture business has to have an open office door policy and foster an atmosphere where the company employees are part of guiding the company to success. Clear communication and leading from the front with all team members knowing why we do what we do.”

He cited Legacy Classic founder and American Home Furnishings Hall of Fame inductee Kevin O’Connor as one of his primary mentors as well as his father.

“Kevin O’Connor has been an incredible mentor for me as well as my father Brian Robinson” he said. “I have also learned tremendously from working for Roy Calcagne Jeff Sheffer and Harvey Dondero.”

What’s next for Robinson?

“Our demand is still high and we are working hard to keep it that way” he said. “To do so the focus is market share. We can control our future demand by adding new customers as well as new placements with current customers. New products must continue to be well merchandised and well-priced.

“Our backlog is still very high so sales will be ahead of prior year orders are running double digits ahead of 2021 so we expect another good year.”

His long-term goals include getting into new categories improving the company’s ‘good better best’ pricing strategy and ramping up its e-commerce presence with its new Home Furniture Outfitters division.

The BYU playmaker later scored on another touchdown run before leaving the game with an ankle injury.

BYU football coach Kalani Sitake was effusive in his praise of the Baylor Bears — who walloped FCS Albany 69-10 in Waco Texas last Saturday — but he didn’t have much to say regarding the status of his two best receivers senior Gunner Romney and junior Puka Nacua on Monday.

Romney didn’t play in the 50-21 win over South Florida while Nacua left the game in the first half with an apparent ankle injury and didn’t return.

“Yeah I will probably know a little bit more later today” Sitake said during his weekly press briefing at noon on Labor Day. “Right now I can’t count anybody out yet. So (we will) probably have more for you in the next couple of days. There are some guys who are questionable but we will see what happens.”

Defensive linemen John Nelson and Gabe Summers also left the game with what appeared to be cramping issues.

Offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick said on his “Coordinators’ Corner” program that Nacua “seems confident he is going to be OK.”

As for Romney who hasn’t practiced much since the first week of fall camp Roderick said he’s hopeful the big receiver will be available against the Bears.

“We thought he was close last week (to playing)” Roderick said.

Nacua caught just one pass for 22 yards but still had a huge effect on the game. He took the first play from scrimmage a jet sweep 75 yards for a touchdown. He added a 5-yard TD run six minutes later.

“I feel good about our preparation (for USF)” Sitake said. “I think we can feel good about some of the points that we put up but I am looking at the opportunities that we missed on and some plays we wish we could get back again.”

He said a lot of players “got valuable reps” in the absence of the star receivers and because the game got lopsided.

“I think that is going to help us out with our depth moving forward” Sitake said. “I hope it carries over because we are going against a really really good team a ranked team and so we gotta prepare for it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5c2FsZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvcm9ja2JyaWRnZS1zZWxscy1raW5ncy1paWktYXJjbGluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockbridge Growth Equity Sells Kings III of America to Arcline Investment Management,"Under Rockbridge’s sponsorship Kings III completed several major strategic initiatives including expansion into new markets and scaling the inside sales team.

Announces Plan for Near-Term Sale of JATENZO® Using Structured Process ...,"NORTHBROOK Ill. Sept. 05 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clarus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (Clarus) (OTC: CRXT) a pharmaceutical company dedicated to providing solutions to unmet medical needs by advancing androgen therapies announced today that it together with its wholly-owned subsidiary Clarus Therapeutics Inc. has filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Court). Clarus has also filed a motion seeking authorization to pursue an auction and sale process under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of its sole commercial asset JATENZO that is approved for use by healthcare providers to treat testosterone deficiency in men with certain medical conditions.



Clarus has filed a series of motions with the Court seeking to ensure the continuation of normal operations while on this path. Clarus believes that it has sufficient financial resources to meet its operational and financial obligations to patients healthcare providers suppliers and employees through the Chapter 11 process. In addition scaled-back efforts will continue to support commercialization of JATENZO.

“After thoroughly exploring our strategic options in a robust process conducted by the Capital Structure Advisory team at Raymond James and in light of the extremely challenging financial markets Clarus’ Board of Directors and its senior management team have unanimously concluded that a structured sale process represents the best possible solution for Clarus and its stakeholders” said Dr Robert Dudley CEO of Clarus. “We strongly believe that JATENZO has the potential to be a valuable product for the treatment of men with testosterone deficiency and with continued commercialization efforts to capture increasing market share over time. Unfortunately Clarus is no longer in a tenable financial position to provide such efforts nor remain a viable entity.”

The proposed bidding procedures if approved by the Court would allow interested parties to submit binding offers to acquire substantially all of Clarus’ assets (i.e. principally JATENZO and related assets) which would be purchased free and clear of Clarus’ indebtedness and certain liabilities. Interested parties could include both strategic and financial buyers for whom substantial due diligence materials are available.

Additional information about this process and proposed asset sale as well as other documents related to the Chapter 11 proceedings is available through Clarus’ claims agent Stretto Inc.. Clarus’ legal counsel is Goodwin Procter LLP and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP and its investment banker is Raymond James & Associates Inc. Clarus has also named Lawrence Perkins of Sierra Constellation Partners LLC as Chief Restructuring Officer during the Chapter 11 process. Interested parties should contact Geoffrey Richards (Geoffrey.Richards@RaymondJames.com) and Simon Wein (Simon.Wein@RaymondJames.com) at Raymond James for additional information related to the auction and sale process and for access to due diligence materials. Clarus filed the voluntary Chapter 11 petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware Case No. 22-10845.

The blue team desktop frontrunner the A770 will launch alongside Arc A750 alternative with both cards offering a ray tracing experience that’s similar to Nvidia Ampere.

In an interview with PCGH Intel Arc GPU marketing director Ryan Shrout and Tom Petersen share various tidbits of Arc Alchemist graphics card information. Petersen confirms that the A770 sits somewhere between an RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti in terms of performance while apparently outpacing the AMD Radeon RX 6600XT.

As for specs the Arc A770 and A750 GPUs will be available with either 8GB or 16GB VRAM. The so-called ‘limited edition’ A770 will stick with 16GB meaning the 8GB variant will likely be a board partner decision.

The new info gives us an idea of what to expect from a high-end Intel Arc GPU especially when it comes to comparative performance. It’s now clear that Alchemist won’t be brawling with either the upcoming Nvidia RTX 4000 lineup or AMD RDNA 3 as specs suggest the cards focus on the budget gaming PC space.

Intel is clearly taking a ‘bang for your buck’ approach with its Arc GPUs. By controlling the price of its range the company hopes to offer a compelling perf per dollar alternative but admits the market is a “tough nut to crack.” To succeed Petersen says the tech giant will need to strengthen its relationship with board partners and provide consistent execution when it comes to GPU products.

The true meaning of Intel Arc ‘limited edition’

Hilariously Intel also cleared up exactly what the A770’s ‘limited edition’ status means and it turns out it’s just branding. Hopefully that means it shouldn’t vanish overnight but the company’s overall GPU supply could still be finite.

As for when the A770 and A750 Arc GPUs will actually arrive Petersen suggests they’ll arrive imminently and will be available via the Intel website. To add reassurance to the release date claims the Intel Fellow stresses that “it’s got to be soon” so that the firm can meet its commitments. Naturally that means it might arrive on the battlefield at the same time as the RTX 4090 but obviously won’t challenge it to a dual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDgwLTE2LWdiLXJ0eC00MDgwLTEyLWdiLXJ1bW9yZWQtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWF0LXRoZS1zYW1lLXRpbWUv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwODAtMTYtZ2ItcnR4LTQwODAtMTItZ2ItcnVtb3JlZC10by1sYXVuY2gtYXQtdGhlLXNhbWUtdGltZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB & RTX 4080 12 GB Rumored To Launch At The Same Time,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDgwLTE2LWdiLXJ0eC00MDgwLTEyLWdiLXJ1bW9yZWQtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWF0LXRoZS1zYW1lLXRpbWUv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwODAtMTYtZ2ItcnR4LTQwODAtMTItZ2ItcnVtb3JlZC10by1sYXVuY2gtYXQtdGhlLXNhbWUtdGltZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167110BBA30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDgwLTE2LWdiLXJ0eC00MDgwLTEyLWdiLXJ1bW9yZWQtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWF0LXRoZS1zYW1lLXRpbWUv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwODAtMTYtZ2ItcnR4LTQwODAtMTItZ2ItcnVtb3JlZC10by1sYXVuY2gtYXQtdGhlLXNhbWUtdGltZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtbG93ZXJzLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTB0aS0zMDgwdGktZm91bmRlcnMtZWRpdGlvbi1ncHUtcHJpY2luZy1pbi1ldXJvcGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA lowers GeForce RTX 3090(Ti)/3080Ti Founders Edition GPU pricing in Europe,"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090/3080 Ti FE finally get a price cut in Europe

It is a fact that GPU prices have rapidly declined in the last few months. It is also true that not all regions were affected just as quickly as the US market. Of course we are well aware of this fact and we do our best to convince GPU makers to finally start selling their cards at lower prices.

Customers might be rightfully discouraged by sluggish GPU deals and their focus should now be on next-gen GPUs. However a significant number of gamers will be looking for RTX 30/RX6000 deals once AMD and NVIDIA switch to new series.

Therefore it is good to report that NVIDIA is finally lowering prices on their Founders Edition in Europe. It is worth noting that not all cards are impacted and even now some models are still sold at inflated prices from January (which makes no sense whatsoever).

GeForce RTX 30 Pricing in Germany Source: NVIDIA

Some of our readers may still remember our last report on European reference card pricing from January this year. Back then NVIDIA had quietly raised prices on their Founders Edition. Unfortunately RTX 3080 RTX 3070 Ti RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition models are still sold at those higher prices (around 5% higher).

However RTX 3090 Ti RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 Ti have now all been discounted. The official MSRP in Europe has dropped by up to 920 EUR for RTX 3090 Ti 350 EUR for RTX 3090 and 110 EUR for RTX 3080 Ti. According to the listing from countries like Germany France or Spain this is a time-limited offer.

Is this a good time to buy Founders Edition? That’s up to customers to decide but a brief look at Geizhals (EU price comparison tool) shows that these prices are more or less in line with custom model pricing in Europe.

The GTC and the NVIDIA GPU giveaway are held weeks before NVIDIA will officially reveal the newest GPU series for the coming years. The expectation is that the new AD102 GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace graphics cards will replace the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti with a more recent series of graphics cards.

Several manufacturers are hosting massive sales to get rid of the surplus RTX 30 series and RX 6000 series video cards before the next-gen graphics cards launch within a few more weeks.

Many companies sell AIB versions of the graphics cards launched by AMD and Nvidia. Most of these aftermarket variants pack better cooling and bumped-up clock speeds. Some options are cheaper than the reference video cards launched by the manufacturers to make the GPUs more accessible to a wider audience.

However picking the best series from a video card manufacturer can be a bit intimidating when faced with a dozen choices. All video cards claim to have the same performance thus determining the best one for a build largely depends on the cooling quality aesthetics and price of the particular variant.

Here are the best manufacturers to choose from and their most notable series.

Note: This list is subjective in no particular order and reflects the writer's opinions.

A guide to purchasing graphics cards from the best manufacturers in the industry

1) Micro-Star International (MSI)

The MSI Suprim X video cards are widely regarded as the best (Image via Sportskeeda)

In addition to the high-end Vulcan graphics cards the company also offers a slightly cut-down iGame Ultra series Advanced OC and the budget BattleAX lineup. The GPUs in the iGame Ultra lineup are known for their aesthetics and high-end components. However users miss out on RGB and features like a tiltable display.

BattleAX GPUs are budget performance-oriented GPUs with just the necessary features to get the video card working at its full potential.

Overall Colorful is a great graphics card manufacturer but they do not sell AMD Radeon GPUs.

6) Sapphire (for AMD Radeon video cards only)

Sapphire manufactures some of the highest-quality video cards on the market. However they are limited to the production of AMD Radeon GPUs only. Sapphire GPUs have a distinguished design language and quality barrier that only the highest-end GPUs from other manufacturers can touch.

The Nitro+ lineup from the company is undoubtedly the best performer in the bunch. However the extra quality comes at a premium. The Nitro+ SE lineup is a slightly cut-down version of the higher-end cards. If users are looking for a cost-effective solution they can look for a budget Sapphire Pulse lineup.

7) XFX (for AMD Radeon video cards only)

XFX is popular for its high-quality graphics cards that do not cost a lot. Their Speedster SWFT 319 lineup of GPUs includes several offerings that can be the cheapest on the market but they perform exceptionally well.

On the high-end XFX has the Speedster MERC 319 lineup known for its thermal efficiency and build quality. However this American video card manufacturer is only limited to AMD Radeon GPUs.

Notable mentions

Apart from the video card manufacturers listed above there are a few others that are worth checking out. These include American graphics card manufacturer EVGA and Taiwanese companies Galax and Zotac.

EVGA

The FTW3 Ultra series from EVGA is arguably one of the best options on the market. On a budget EVGA has an XC3 Ultra lineup. However the company does not sell AMD Radon video cards.

Zotac

Another notable manufacturer is Zotac. The company's AMP Extreme Holo AMP Holo and Trinity OC lineups are based on some high-quality components.

Apart from these series the company sells the Tianqi OC and PGF OC series exclusively in the Asian market. However Zotac cards can be notorious in terms of thermal efficiency. Zotac only sells Nvidia Geforce video cards.

Galax

Galax also manufactures some high-quality graphics cards on the market. Their notable series includes the 1-click-OC lineup which mainly focuses on budget offerings. On the high-end spectrum the company sells the SG series of video cards. Like EVGA and Zotac Galax only sells Nvidia Geforce graphics cards."

Emma Huntley underwent the procedure in May 2022 after battling ulcerative colitis – which left her with debilitating symptoms including passing blood and vomiting and eventually perforated part of her bowel.

Before the operation she feared how wearing a bag on the outside of her tummy to collect poo bypassing her damaged colon would change the way she looked forever.

But now Emma 25 who lives in Carmarthen Wales wants to raise awareness that stoma bags can positively transform people’s lives. Emma said: “Having been diagnosed back in 2018 I knew a stoma bag was something I would likely have to face eventually but I never expected to be so young.

“I had thought I would be in my thirties or forties by the time I had the procedure so to be 25 was a shock.”

She added: “I dreaded the surgery.”

But instead the bag has set her free. “The stoma changed my life for the better and gave me a completely new lease of life” she said.

“Before I was going to the loo up to 16 times a day experienced severe abdominal pain and started passing blood.”

She added: “I was so limited and scared to leave the house in case I needed to go to the loo. Now I’m back at work and feel like I have my normal life back again. It’s incredible.”

While Emma was diagnosed in July 2018 with ulcerative colitis a lifelong condition where parts of the gut become swollen inflamed and ulcerated she believes she has experienced symptoms since she was 12.

She said: “For a long time I passed off the symptoms as nothing serious just a bit of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) but as the years went on and I got older the effects got worse.”

It meant I couldn’t do the things I enjoyed any longer.

Emma Huntley

She added: “I was running to the toilet up to 16 times a day which led to weight loss and nausea.”

As the symptoms progressed Emma says that it began to restrict her life.

She said: “I’ve always been really into fitness and I love running but I found that I couldn’t risk venturing out for a run in case I realised I suddenly needed the toilet while being five miles from home.”

She added: “It meant I couldn’t do the things I enjoyed any longer.”

Hospitalised for two weeks in 2018 following a flare-up when she was 21 and studying at the University of Surrey in Guildford  Emma says she also feared the condition would affect her new relationship with Will a fellow student.

She said: “I started dating Will just three or four months before I was diagnosed and I worried that it would put him off seeing me.”

She added: “But he has never treated me any differently. He’s been my absolute rock throughout all of this.

“He was one of the first people I told about the symptoms I was experiencing and he’s been absolutely brilliant from the start.”

After her spell in hospital Emma was put on infliximab a medicine commonly used to treat Colitis and Crohn’s and this helped her through the next few years as she graduated from university moved to Carmarthen and started her first job as a small animal vet.

She said: “The medication helped to alleviate my symptoms for three years but this year things started to get bad again.

“I was in so much pain my colon perforated in May which led to symptoms of sepsis and my doctor advised that it was only a matter of time before I would have no choice but to have a stoma fitted.”

Emma was unable to work for three months and Will 24 who was still in Guildford was worried about her.

“He was driving three hours to Wales every weekend just to make sure I was okay” Emma said.

But she admits she had reservations about the procedure.

She said: “It’s a scary thought to know that your body is going to change I had mixed emotions.”

I was running to the toilet up to 16 times a day which led to weight loss and nausea.

Emma Huntley

She added: “It would mean a massive change to the way I look and how I live my life.

“But ultimately I knew it was the best thing to do for my health and I knew I couldn’t live like this anymore.

“It got to the point where I was in so much pain that I stopped caring about the way it would change my body as long as it took the pain away.”

Undergoing the six-hour surgery in May 2022 Emma says she felt better immediately when she came round from the general anaesthetic.

She said: “I was sore from the actual procedure but I just remember waking up and feeling so much better internally.”

And now she feels liberated.

She added: “I can fully embrace my job I am not in pain I have loads more energy and can get back into my fitness and running without the fear of having a toilet emergency.

“I feel as if I’ve taken my life back which is so empowering.”

Now Emma is training for the Brighton Marathon 2023 which she is running in aid of charity Crohn’s & Colitis UK.

She said: “I used to need an afternoon nap every day now I’m training for a marathon – it just shows what you can do when you can suddenly redivert all the energy taken up with the stresses of such a condition into physical activity.

“My life really has changed thanks to the stoma – it’s saved my life.”

High Yield Dividend King #20: Target Corporation (TGT)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Target is a giant discount retailer. Its business consists of about 1850 big box stores which offer general merchandise and food as well as serving as distribution points for the company’s burgeoning e-commerce business. Target should produce about $110 billion in total revenue this year.

Target reported first quarter earnings on May 18th 2022 and results were much worse than expected from a margin perspective. Adjusted earnings-per-share missed estimates by 87 cents at $2.19. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $25.2 billion which was $690 million ahead of estimates.

Comparable sales grew 3.3% which was due to traffic growth of 3.9% and a slightly lower average ticket size. Store comparable sales were up 3.4% while digital comparable sales grew 3.2%. Operating income was $1.3 billion down from $2.4 billion driven primarily by a lower gross margin rate. Gross margins plunged from 30.0% to 25.7% of sales due to higher markdowns and costs related to freight supply chain disruptions and increased wages.

The company noted operating margin rate should be roughly where it was in Q1 for Q2 and the company expects to see low- to mid-single digit revenue growth and operating income margin around 6% for the year.

High Yield Dividend King #19: Illinois Tool Works (ITW)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Illinois Tool Works is a diversified multi-industrial manufacturer with seven unique operating segments: Automotive Food Equipment Test & Measurement Welding Polymers & Fluids Construction Products and Specialty Products. Last year the company generated $14.5 billion in revenue. The company is geographically diversified with more than half of its revenue generated outside of the United States.

On August 2nd 2022 Illinois Tool Works reported second quarter 2022 results for the period ending June 30th 2022. For the quarter revenue came in at $4.0 billion up 9% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% in the Automotive OEM segment the largest out of the company’s seven segments. Five of the other segments saw sales growth above 20% with the last segment being flat. Net income equaled $738 million or $2.37 per share compared to $775 million or $2.45 per share in Q2 2021.

Source: Investor Presentation

Illinois Tool Works also reiterated its 2022 earnings guidance and sees $9.00 to $9.40 in earnings-per-share for the full year. At the same time the company reduced its revenue growth estimates to 6% to 9% (down from 8.5% to 11.5%). The company also plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2022.

Illinois Tool Works has an excellent dividend growth history. Its payout ratio was relatively high during the last financial crisis but the company was not forced to cut the payout. Today the dividend payout ratio sits at 53% of expected earnings above the company’s long-term target meaning that future dividend growth may trail earnings growth.

High Yield Dividend King #18: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Procter & Gamble is a consumer products giant that sells its products in over 180 countries.

Source: Investor Presentation

Procter & Gamble’s dividend payout ratio has oscillated between 50% and 75% in the last decade with the current mark coming in around 60%. This is somewhat high for your typical company but well within a reasonable range for such a high-quality firm. We believe that the company can keep growing its dividend at a rate roughly in line with earnings-pershare growth going forward.

Procter & Gamble has significant competitive advantages thanks to its strong brands. The company has several categoryleading brands. These brands provide Procter & Gamble with pricing power and consistent profits in good times or bad. During the Great Recession the company posted earnings-per-share of $3.04 $3.64 $3.58 $3.53 and $3.93 in the 2007 through 2011 stretch while the dividend kept on rising.

Dividend Yield: 2.6%

Cincinnati Financial is an insurance company founded in 1950. It offers business home auto insurance and financial products including life insurance annuities property and casualty insurance. Cincinnati Financial is headquartered in Fairfield Ohio trading with a $20.1 billion market capitalization.

As an insurance company Cincinnati Financial makes money in two ways. It earns income from premiums on policies written and by investing its float or the large sum of money consisting of the time value between the premium income and insurance claims.

Cincinnati Financial has grown earnings by 11.5% per year over the past nine years and 15.6% over the past five years. Consensus analysts expect earnings to grow by 6% for the next five years. Book value a significant metric for insurance companies has increased by 10.4% over the past nine years and 8.4% over the past five years.

Unlike many insurers the company is not a significant buyer of its shares for per-share growth. The company makes most of its net income from its investment gains and is highly dependent on bond interest rates and stock market performance. Cincinnati Financial is a somewhat aggressive investor and has a 39.3% allocation to equities compared to many insurers. This gives the company better long-term portfolio growth but a bit more volatility.

Dividend Yield: 2.6%

The price of natural gas has rallied to a 13-year high lately due to the sanctions of Europe on Russia for its invasion in Ukraine. Thanks to this tailwind National Fuel Gas raised its guidance for the earnings-pershare of 2022 again from $5.20-$5.50 to $5.70-$6.00 for 36% growth at the mid-point.

High Yield Dividend King #12: Computer Services (CSVI)

Dividend Yield: 2.9%

Computer Services provides regional banks with a wide range of services such as core processing digital banking payments processing and regulatory compliance solutions.

In early May Computer Services reported (5/4/2022) financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company grew its revenue by 7% from $75.5 million to a nearly all-time high of $81.0 million and its earnings-per-share by 24% from $0.49 to $0.61 thanks to new accounts continued demand for digital banking services and higher demand for payments processing and regulatory compliance.

Notably approximately 90% of the total revenues are generated from long-term contracts. Management expects to accelerate investments in the business in the new fiscal year.

Given also higher staffing levels and a return to pre-pandemic travel levels management expects earnings growth to somewhat decelerate later this year. In September Computer Services raised its dividend by 8.0% which marked the 50th consecutive year of dividend growth.

Computer Services has grown its earnings-per-share at an 11.3% average annual rate over the last decade. The pandemic has not affected the performance of Computer Services at all. Thanks to sustained momentum in the core business and no signs of fatigue we expect it to grow its earnings-per-share by 7.0% per year over the next five years.

The impressive growth record of Computer Services is a testament to the strength of its business model and the existence of a significant competitive advantage. The company signs multi-year contracts with its customers and offers them a wide range of services. It is very costly and inefficient for these customers to stop working with the

company particularly given that they pay appreciable early termination fees.

As a result Computer Services enjoys high renewal rates. In fact when it loses a customer the most frequent reason is that the bank has been acquired by another bank that is not a customer of Computer Services.

So what does that mean for investors?

A 2019 change to the rules governing investment funds made it easier for managers to convert mutual funds to ETFs by removing the need for separate approval of each potential conversion by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A handful of asset managers including Dimensional Fund Advisors and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s J.P. Morgan Asset Management have recently converted actively managed mutual funds into actively managed ETFs. They say the change is in response to the preference of many investors for ETFs which generally offer lower fees than mutual funds and provide a tax advantage.

Investors in the funds being converted might appreciate those benefits. But they need a brokerage account to keep the new ETF and may have some tax consequences if they own fractional shares of the mutual fund.

Why convert?

The initial group of conversions has mostly been in actively managed stock or bond funds. For example J.P. Morgan completed conversions of four funds in June an actively managed fixed-income fund now called JPMorgan Inflation Managed Bond ETF (JCPI); an active equities fund now JPMorgan Market Expansion Enhanced Equity ETF (JMEE); a real-estate income fund now JPMorgan Realty Income ETF (JPRE); and a global equities fund now JPMorgan International Research Enhanced Equity ETF (JIRE). Dimensional Fund Advisors converted a $30 billion suite of actively managed systematic funds last year. Systematic funds’ investment decisions are largely guided by models based on extensive market data rather than left purely to the fund managers’ discretion.

Analysts say actively managed funds are likely to be where most conversions happen. That’s because active funds have higher fees than passive ones and tend to generate more taxable gains through trading which makes them more vulnerable to investors’ preference for lower fees and taxes.

There is a recognition among asset managers that there is a better way to offer certain strategies and that’s coming alongside investor demand for ETFs"" says Daniel Sotiroff a Morningstar analyst. Even mutual funds that already have some of the qualities of an ETF can benefit from conversion he says. “If you look at what Dimensional converted those funds were already tax managed as mutual funds"" meaning they were designed to minimize investors’ tax burden. “The ETF structure makes that process easier to do and comes with lower fees.""

He notes that ETFs typically don’t charge the so-called 12b-1 fees that mutual funds do. These fees which are named after the SEC rule that allows them to be charged cover the marketing and distribution of a mutual fund or ETF. ETFs also tend to have fewer trading transactions than mutual funds which means they have lower transaction costs because trades aren’t triggered by asset inflows and outflows in ETFs as they are in mutual funds.

ETFs offer a tax advantage because since they can make fewer trades they distribute fewer if any capital gains to investors. Some mutual funds are designed to distribute fewer gains but investors are still likely to see taxable distributions over the course of their investment in a mutual fund.

The higher fees of actively managed funds and the taxes on capital gains from distributions have led to outflows in favor of actively managed ETFs with similar strategies for a number of years. The SEC rule change for conversions gives investors the option to stick with the same strategy and managers at a lower cost.

For fund managers a conversion allows them to keep the performance record of the mutual fund as well as any investor assets in the fund that stay through the conversion. That can give the new ETF a leg up over a newly launched ETF as many investors and financial advisers want to see a substantial record and enough assets to support the long-term viability of a fund before investing.

What to watch for

For investors in a mutual fund that is up for conversion there are a few things to keep in mind.

Those who invested in a mutual fund through a transfer agent instead of a broker which is common will need a brokerage account to be able to hold and trade the ETF. If they don’t have a brokerage account there are many low-cost brokers with some offering low or no minimums to open an account but it may be a bit of a learning curve for those who haven’t used a brokerage account before.

ETFs also don’t offer fractional shares. Any fractional shares of the mutual fund held at the point of conversion will be redeemed and could result in a taxable gain.

A conversion may also require approval from shareholders and if enough shareholders don’t want to convert fund managers may opt to offer a separate ETF that runs the same strategy.

Individual investors can then decide to move into the ETF on their own but that could result in tax consequences when they sell out of the mutual fund if they end up with capital gains.

Results from a phase 3 extension trial have demonstrated the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent – also known as dupilumab – as a maintenance therapy when added to other asthma medications.

The treatment – developed by Sanofi and Regeneron – was consistent for up to two years in children aged six to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation.

The results were presented in a late-breaking session at the recent 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress. It also coincided with the notable milestone that more than 500000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent in its approved indications.

The results were from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo during the phase 3 trial. Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent providing up to two years of data in total.

Leonard Bacharier director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research explained: “An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an oeosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma.”

“This new data further supports the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent – which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma with an oeosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma – and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as six years old” he added.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have a higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that can carry significant risks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlbmVuZ25ld3MuY29tL3RvcGljcy9iaW9wcm9jZXNzaW5nL2hvc3QtY2VsbC1wcm90ZWlucy1jYW4tYmUtZWxpbWluYXRlZC1tb3JlLXN0cmF0ZWdpY2FsbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Cell Proteins Can Be Eliminated More Strategically,"Host cells that are modified to express therapeutic proteins are the foundation of the biopharmaceutical industry. However these cells also express proteins other than the ones they’re supposed to express. These “other” proteins are called appropriately enough host cell proteins or HCPs. They represent one of the biggest challenges in biomanufacturing.

“HCPs are process-related impurities that could degrade either product molecules or excipients used in a formulation potentially compromising the product’s stability” explains Nisha Palackal PhD director of protein biochemistry Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. “HCPs also have the potential to be immunogenic in humans.”

Palackal points out that in process development the need to remove HCPs is easy to recognize. What’s hard is deciding how exactly HCPs should be removed. “It is the goal of every drug manufacturer to remove as many HCPs as possible” she elaborates. “But some HCPs are very difficult to remove. They can ‘hitchhike’ with the drug of interest and come through to the final product.”

“If the identity of the HCP in the final formulated material is known downstream processes can be improved to specifically remove this impurity” Palackal remarks. “Alternatively methods can be developed to monitor this impurity.”

Familiar but still troublesome HCPs

Known HCPs include lipases—enzymes that cells use to break down fats and lipids. “Recently a lot of attention has been directed toward a class of HCPs called lipases” Palackal notes. “They can degrade polysorbates in the formulation thus affecting the stability of the therapeutic protein. Proteases like cathepsins metalloproteinases and serine proteases have been shown to degrade therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.”

The potential for HCPs to reduce product stability is also highlighted by Feng Yang PhD senior scientist Protein Analytical Chemistry Genentech. She states that various HCP species can impact both active ingredients and excipients in biologic formulations.

“Several hydrolases such as lipoprotein lipase and lysosomal phospholipase A2 are among the root causes for polysorbate degradation in biopharmaceutical protein formulations” she details. “Such HCPs may compromise stability and reduce the shelf life of drug products.”

According to Yang the problem of polysorbate degradation has attracted the interest of researchers. To support this contention she cites a study focused on knocking out CHO HCPs that degrade polysorbate1 as well as a study that identified an HCP called lysosomal phospholipase A2 isomer X1 (LPLA2) that degraded antibody formulations.2

Besides compromising quality and stability “polysorbate degradation can lead to the formation of particles in formulations creating safety concerns” Feng says.

Of all the harms caused by HCPs unwanted immune responses can be the most serious. They can even be lethal. Consequently biomanufacturers keep a close eye on potentially dangerous HCPs. One such HCP is phospholipase B-like 2 protein. This HCP Feng relates was found in lebrikizumab clinical material and shown to trigger “specific and measurable immune responses in around 90% of subjects based on data from clinical studies.”

Established HCP detection techniques

The first stage of any HCP removal strategy is detection. In the biopharmaceutical industry this usually means the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISAs rely on antibodies to bind target proteins. ELISAs that provide quantitative measurements of total HCP levels may use a multitude of antibodies.

ELISAs are widely accepted as the gold standard for release testing for HCPs. “The ELISA method is very sensitive in terms of detecting HCPs” says Roger Lio PhD a research scientist at Bristol Myers-Squibb. “Moreover it is a method that can be readily automated through coupling it with robotic liquid handler. With all these advantages ELISA is a method that has high throughput and that can deliver accurate global quantification of HCPs.

But ELISAs are not perfect Lio admits and industry efforts to improve them are focused on increasing the proportion of the HCPs that they can detect which is known as the assay’s “coverage.”

“The shortcomings of ELISA-based approaches are mainly related to the coverage and HCP identifications” Lio explains. “Related to coverage ELISA is based upon antibodies against HCPs; thus a sufficient ELISA HCP method requires the antibody to have high coverage of HCPs in the sample. This requires extensive development before the antibody is deployed to characterize real samples.”

The assays also struggle with complex samples. According to Lio this limitation is an area of ongoing research. “As for identification” he continues “an ELISA itself cannot reveal the individual identities of HCPs when characterizing samples with a mixture of different HCPs. These limitations drive the further development of complementary HCP detection methods.”

This take is shared by Regeneron’s Palackal who says the shortcomings of these assays remain a major catalyst for research. “A traditional ELISA to determine the level of total HCPs is required for every batch release” she remarks. “Based on the levels of HCP detected further identification using mass spectrometry techniques has become a common practice within drug makers.

“Identification of the HCP impurity enables the drug manufacturer to design specific steps in downstream processing to remove or develop methods to monitor this impurity. Significant progress has been made in detecting and identifying HCPs over the past decade.”

A new HCP detection technique

The dynamic range of ELISA assays—the lowest to the highest concentrations of a particular protein the assay can detect—is another area of research. Such work says Genentech’s Feng Yang is becoming more important as product titers rise.

“The challenge is mainly the broad dynamic range required to detect low-level hydrolytic enzyme peptides in the presence of excessively abundant peptides from biotherapeutic products” she stresses. “For example if hydrolytic enzymes are to be detected at a 0.1-ppm level the dynamic range must exceed seven orders of magnitude.”

To address this need Feng and colleagues developed an alternative HCP detection workflow one that uses liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and offers much greater sensitivity.

“With our approach” she asserts “we not only have achieved 0.1-ppm sensitivity for the challenging hydrolytic enzyme detection but also have demonstrated the robustness of the method at this 0.1-ppm sensitivity by consistently identifying HCPs at 0.1 ppm or above regardless of their sizes and sequences. This robustness is extremely important to increase the confidence of the HCP analysis.

“With this workflow for 0.1-ppm sensitivity to identify unknown HCPs we also have shown the 0.01-ppm sensitivity in detecting and quantifying known/targeted hydrolytic enzymes to support our process development toward risk mitigation of polysorbate degradation and visual particle formation.”

Prioritizing the removal of problematic HCPs

Detection is only the first challenge that HCPs present to process developers. Once a population of HCPs is identified researchers need to work out how to get rid of them a task that is further complicated by the fact that different proteins need different removal processes.

One approach is to target the problematic HCPs—those known to provoke a harmful immune response for example—and develop a removal process to deal with them as a priority. To discuss how this approach might work a 26-company team participated in the BioPhorum Development Group HCP Workstream.

In 2021 the team’s deliberations culminated in the publication of a paper. It was titled “‘High-risk’ host cell proteins (HCPs): A multi-company collaborative view” and it detailed a classification system to determine if a particular HCP is considered “high risk.”3

One of the paper’s authors was Regeneron’s Palackal. “We set out recommendations for the industry in monitoring and controlling these high-risk proteins” she recalls. “I highly encourage the HCP community to refer to this paper for further information.” The idea she says was to provide a step-by-step guide that could help process developers leverage risk assessments to establish a comprehensive control strategy for downstream HCP removal or neutralization.

Demand centres are located in the north where urban density precludes the creation of huge projects. However the supply side lies in the Sahara in the country’s southern half where sun irradiation and geographical space are abundant. Added to the issue of remoteness climatic conditions (among other considerations) mean that the cost of building solar PV installations is 30 per cent higher in Algeria than the global average.36

Beyond governance barriers and towards energy democracy

The lack of a long-term energy strategy is a main governance hurdle in regard to the energy transition: renewable energy initiatives are inefficient fragmented and lack coordination. Algeria’s energy sector has been slow to adapt to the world’s critical need for renewable energy driven by climate change. As summarized earlier Algeria has announced ambitious plans but little has been accomplished due to poor management the lack of a unified energy strategy and insufficient political will. While energy policies and regulations in the sector are either inspired by those in foreign jurisdictions or generated domestically in each case their implementation is impeded by bureaucracy and corruption.

The energy sector is centralized in Algiers and is led by the energy and mining ministries and by the oil/gas/electricity monopolies Sonatrach and Sonelgaz. In this top-down and highly authoritarian centralized governance system ideas from the grassroots are unlikely to be heard and accepted. Added to this Algeria adopts a republican governance model which means that the elected body is the sole decision-making authority. The president appoints provincial governors exhibiting a top-down organization in which policy innovations at the local level remain uncommon. Because civil society is weak and fragmented with little interest in climate and energy issues the fossil fuel industry’s agenda is largely unaffected by the influence of popular action. There is thus a need to adopt a more flexible participatory and transparent policy approach so that Algerians can participate in discussions of and offer solutions for the country’s energy problems. Furthermore including individuals in energy decision-making would boost their sense of ownership of public energy assets which could lead to a shift in the population’s behaviour towards more responsible and solution-oriented attitudes. Rebuilding confidence between the government and the population by increasing openness accountability and most importantly respecting citizens’ decisions would be a first step towards energy democracy in Algeria. More decentralized alternatives might offer people the power to choose how they generate consume and exchange energy while maintaining the state’s critical role as manager controller and legislator.

Algeria suffers from acute water scarcity which threatens the country’s food security among other consequences such as risking the collapse of agriculture and the displacement of local communities. For example in August 2021 huge wildfires burned tens of thousands of hectares of woodland in the north of the country killing at least 90 people. However despite the obvious catastrophic impacts of climate change on the country in recent years climate change is rarely addressed in the country’s energy plans in part due to the institutional weakness of the Ministry of the Environment. It is therefore urgent to include the climate variable in future energy policies and scenarios.37

Financing the energy transition

Despite the falling cost of solar and wind technologies renewable energy projects remain capital-intensive. Financing the transition is thus a huge challenge for Algeria. Three national funding options seem to be available: public funds domestic private funds and foreign direct investment.

In the current context of economic crisis public funds are increasingly solicited to address what are considered to be more pressing socioeconomic grievances and thus can only offer a limited support for the transition in the short term. However a thorough examination of the country’s economic position during the last two decades reveals there has been massive waste and poor management of public finances in addition to entrenched corruption. For any meaningful and just energy transition in Algeria the state needs to be democratized and the endemic corruption must be halted. The state should also play a bigger role in the transition should commit more public funds and should argue for significant climate finance on the international stage. Additionally it is important to remember that when oil prices rise (as they are doing now) it offers the possibility of establishing sovereign funds that can enable national funding for the modernization of energy systems.

Further important financing avenues such as climate reparation funds and the payment of ecological debt by the Global North could be effective in helping to achieve a fair energy transition for Global South oil-dependent economies such as Algeria. However there remain doubts about whether such actions are likely to occur. For example while an $8.5 billion pledge to support South Africa’s phase-out of coal was made at the COP26 international climate summit38 this has unfortunately not yet materialized. Yet we cannot talk about a just energy transition without raising the question of the payment of climate debts and reparations by the rich Global North to countries in the Global South – not as new loans but rather as transfers of wealth. This is not just an ethical or moral imperative it is also a historical responsibility. The industrialized West must pay its fair share in aiding poorer countries that are less responsible for climate change and that are often also more vulnerable with their adaptation plans and green transitions. Unfortunately current processes do not allow for such assistance for middle-income and oil-producing countries like Algeria as countries with more complicated energy issues such as problems with accessing clean energy are prioritized. This reflects how international climate policies are still trapped in an ‘aid and development’ framework and do not reckon at all with the real need to leave existing gas and oil reserves in the ground – and what that entails in terms of significant loss of revenues. Halting extraction will require global redistributive policies that directly address the needs of oil-exporting countries including middle-income ones like Algeria.

Turning to the domestic situation it is evident that political will to finance the energy transition is currently lacking in Algeria. For instance a special fund was established in 2015 to finance renewable energy programmes but this has not been effectively utilized due to the lack of an executive decree outlining a legal measure on using this fund. Sovereign policies in the country ban foreign debt and limit international financing in vital and strategic sectors such as energy to 49 per cent as compared to 51 per cent for Algerian partners. However due to pressure from the local and global capitalist energy lobby which argues that Algeria’s ‘insecure’ and ‘rigid’ regulatory framework discourages foreign investment the minimum sovereign criterion of 49/51 per cent has been dropped for renewable energy projects. The private investor class in Algeria which is mainly constituted of family funds prefers to participate in quick profit-generating projects where they can recoup their capital fast unlike renewable energy projects where they will have to wait a long period to repay their investment. Furthermore after a decade of empty promises and unmet commitments investors in Algeria have lost confidence in the country’s renewable energy schemes. Nevertheless since the PNEREE was announced in 2011 some private investors have been working to establish a solar PV value chain to assist the programme.

Despite all of the big announcements made by the political elites in Algeria about the deployment of renewable energy very little has been accomplished in terms of raising finances for the energy transition from the three sources discussed above. At the same time Algeria wasted the crucial opportunity offered by the 2004–2014 oil bonanza when oil and gas prices were very high to use the significant revenues generated to industrialize diversify its economy embark on a solid energy transition and create green jobs. Instead the super-profits made during this period were siphoned off by a predatory and corrupt elite.39

Finally in this discussion of financing the energy transition one worthwhile avenue that Algeria can pursue is strategies to encourage citizens to invest in community-based small-scale renewable energy projects and powering integrated communal projects. This form of direct energy democracy can offer an opportunity for job creation and community empowerment.

Expertise and technology barriers

In contrast to its historical experience with oil and gas technologies Algeria lacks expertise in green technologies. This is mostly due to the lack of political interest that has been shown in green technologies in recent years as well as the Algerian economy’s de-industrialization since neoliberal reforms began in the 1980s. The process of liberalization and the transition to the market economy was accompanied by the elimination of both theoretical and practical knowledge in industry culminating in the liquidation of institutes specializing in crucial areas such as the energy steel and textile industries. Following a campaign against technical secondary education technical industrial branches that had contributed to the training of engineers and senior technicians for decades were liquidated.40 The number of experts available to support the energy transition programme particularly in terms of renewable energy energy efficiency and all economic and industrial activities related to it is still far below the critical mass required.41 There is thus a need for more applied research and practical training. Algeria needs to receive technology transfers and managerial expertise from nations that have managed the transition effectively. Such cooperation should aim to achieve human and material capacity building in Algeria. This will require overcoming the current monopolized technological boundaries and the intellectual property regime enforced by free trade agreements and the international financial institutions.

One of the most difficult aspects of any energy transition in the Global South is establishing control over technology (technology transfer) and industrialization: this is required in order to achieve the level of economic integration needed for the development of a thriving green economy with green jobs. This necessitates a paradigm shift away from neoliberalism and towards greater state involvement and investment as well as some climate funding from the most developed countries. A local content requirement (a policy imposed by the government that requires firms to use domestically manufactured goods or domestically supplied services in order to operate in the economy) is crucial to the development of a solid and autonomous renewable energy sector in Algeria. The bidders who are chosen for developing renewable energy projects must play their part in an industrial strategy whereby solar energy components are developed locally. Such a strategy should aim to create a local solar energy economy while also lowering project costs by avoiding the costs of imported materials.42 Although such a strategy would benefit the local economy and particularly the job market it will be extremely challenging to implement in Algeria because the local industrial value chain is still not fully formed: it is currently in its infancy and much local production does not meet international standards. In this context foreign investors are currently lobbying for the abolition of the local content requirement because they see it as an investment barrier that hinders the generation of lucrative profits for themselves. However while abandoning such measures would perhaps attract more funds and boost the energy sector it would not benefit the Algerian economy Algerian industry and the Algerian job market. As such it is crucial to look at effective solutions for creating and enhancing technology and expertise by going beyond the Western-enforced intellectual property rights regime and technology monopolies through entering into win-win partnerships with countries in the Global South such as China.

Access to energy and the matter of subsidies

Algeria’s energy market is still dominated by the government. However the state-owned utility’s unsustainable economic model and its mismanagement have given rise to calls for privatization and the end of subsidies. In order to adapt to the current drastic changes in the energy landscape the Algerian utility Sonelgaz needs to adopt technical managerial and financial reforms to make it economically viable as well as more accountable and transparent. Moreover a progressive subsidy reform is also imperative.

Electricity is currently heavily subsidized in Algeria: households pay the equivalent of $0.038 per kilowatt hour (KWh) for electricity (1/7th of price paid in the United Kingdom). Businesses pay $0.033.43 These low prices which are well below the cost of production (amounting to around one-third of the production cost) are made possible by subsidies.

There are also additional indirect subsidies through subsidies to fossil fuels which are relevant here given that the country’s electricity comes primarily from fossil fuels. Unfortunately these subsidies alongside Algeria’s regressive tax system do not benefit the needy classes as much as they enrich business and capital owners in the country. A just subsidy reform is thus a political and economic imperative. This reform needs to be progressive in terms of which sections of society are subsidized: this should not include the richest classes and capitalist groups (who thereby increase their profits); rather it should seek to lessen the plight of the most vulnerable in society.44

Algeria is currently facing a double socioeconomic and political crisis. The mass-protest movement (Hirak) that started in February 2019 and lasted for more than a year was a serious political challenge to the Algerian regime. This in combination with the very negative economic repercussions of Covid-19 makes any blanket removal of energy subsidies in the near future politically untenable – as well as unjust for the millions of Algerians that have been pauperized over the last few years. For example in response to the global fall in oil prices in 2020 with the economy shrinking by 6 per cent according to the IMF and the country’s foreign reserves declining from $62 billion to $47 billion by the end of 202045 the government limited its commitment on social spending: with a 30 per cent cut in such spending. Nevertheless the country saw a significant budget deficit reaching 18.4 per cent of GDP in 2021.46 On top of increased poverty levels hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost including in the precarious informal sector. According to government data 500000 jobs were lost in 2020 alone.4748 At the time of writing the Algerian economy is still under stress though the war in Ukraine might prove to be a blessing to Algeria’s rulers as oil and gas prices are once again soaring.

Integrating renewable electricity in the governmental subsidy schemes may be an option for promoting the deployment of renewable energy. However the existing global neoliberal climate policy paradigm has proven inefficient in dis-incentivizing fossil fuels through a carbon pricing model and through encouraging low-carbon investment through subsidies and favoured contractual structures. This policy paradigm sees governments as protectors of private players’ capital which prohibits them from addressing social and environmental challenges. With its massive investment deficit and technological inefficiency privatization market approaches have so far failed to bring about the energy transition that is so essential in Algeria.49 Thus there is a need for strong political commitment towards the energy transition within the Algerian public energy sector with the controlled inclusion of private sector actors alongside more participative transparent and democratic governance of the state-owned companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOS8wNS8yNTA5ODUxLzAvZW4vQ3VzdG9tZXItUmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLU1hbmFnZW1lbnQtQ1JNLU1hcmtldC1XaWxsLVN1cnBhc3MtVVNELTEwNi02LUJpbGxpb24tYXQtMTItOS1DQUdSLUdyb3d0aC1WYW50YWdlLU1hcmtldC1SZXNlYXJjaC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Market Will Surpass USD 106.6 Billion at 12.9% CAGR Growth | Vantage ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.globenewswire.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/news-release/2022/09/05/2509851/0/en/Customer-Relationship-Management-CRM-Market-Will-Surpass-USD-106-6-Billion-at-12-9-CAGR-Growth-Vantage-Market-Research.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711113550>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOS8wNS8yNTA5ODUxLzAvZW4vQ3VzdG9tZXItUmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLU1hbmFnZW1lbnQtQ1JNLU1hcmtldC1XaWxsLVN1cnBhc3MtVVNELTEwNi02LUJpbGxpb24tYXQtMTItOS1DQUdSLUdyb3d0aC1WYW50YWdlLU1hcmtldC1SZXNlYXJjaC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The Newby Island Landfill will pay $210000 to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to settle a total of 30 violations spanning the course of six years according to the nine-county environmental regulatory agency. The violations which occurred between 2014 to 2020 include issues surrounding gas surface leaks misuse of equipment and odor complaints coming from the 342-acre site located in the northwestern corner of the city. According to BAAQMD the violations have been corrected.

“The Air District continues to focus diligently on the Newby Island facility and making sure that the odors and air quality impacts are reduced as we go forward” said the agency’s spokesperson Ralph Borrmann.

Results of the settlement were made public at the beginning of the month.

The settlement comes as the landfill and its odor issues continue to be a major source of consternation for Milpitas residents who have voiced concerns for years that their homes downwind of the facility are engulfed in a noxious aroma of garbage.

This spring the city released two separate studies about the site’s smell. The first asked residents near the facility to describe the odors with many replying “sewage” “septic” “fecal” “urine” “garbage” “sweet or rotten vegetables” “rancid” “putrid” and “manure.”

In the second study the BAAQMD determined that the stink in the city could be attributed to the Newby Island facility especially from its garbage operations — as opposed to its composting activities. The agency recommended that the landfill upgrade its equipment and increase its monitoring of odors at a cost of an estimated $500000 to $800000.

According to BAAQMD’s May report the agency has received 9635 complaints from Milpitas residents since 2015. The highest number of complaints occurred in 2016 and has been trending downwards ever since.

“We are pleased to have resolved this issue with the District” landfill operator Republic Services spokesperson Deidre Edgar wrote in a statement. The facility is currently set to operate until at least 2041 and has expanded in size over the years.

Milpitas Mayor Rich Tran said in an interview that he was skeptical whether the monetary fines against the landfill — which has settled with BAAQMD before over previous violations — would make any difference.

“Our community in the past has seen financial consequences for the Newby Island operator” said Tran. “At this point we’re really looking to see improved air quality rather than anything else.” Tran said that he and other council members will be meeting with Newby Island officials this month to discuss how to decrease the site’s smells.

“It really comes down to resources” the mayor said. “Existing or lacking. Folks can really use better infrastructure or tech to reduce the gas emissions.”

Aside from BAAQMD settlements the landfill has also been involved in other legal issues. In 2016 the site’s operator agreed to a $1.2 million settlement with Milpitas residents living in a 1.5-mile radius of the landfill over odor issues dust and air pollution. In 2018 Newby Island reached an agreement with a local environment group that would prevent toxic runoff into the Bay’s waters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vbGl0ZW9ubGluZS5jb20vdHJhc2gtaW4tYm9pc2UtcmVjeWNsaW5nLWJpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is It Actually Illegal To Put Trash In A Recycling Bin In Idaho?,"We are told not to put trash in our recycle bins but what happens if we do? If your trash container is full does anyone notice if you put that one bag of trash in your blue recycle bin?

In some states putting non-recyclable items in the recycle bins is illegal. I was surprised to learn the truth about the recycling laws in Idaho.

Is it illegal to put trash in a recycling container in Boise Idaho?

No. While it's not preferred according to the Boise Police Department there is nothing criminal about it. However you may be subject to penalties from Republic Services the company contracted by the City of Boise for trash services.

What are the potential penalties for putting trash in a recycling container in Boise Idaho?

According to Republic Services you could theoretically be charged an additional trash pickup fee of $13.68. However they have no record of this ever happening. If the problem persists you could potentially have your recycle container removed from service.

Clearly the City of Boise doesn't care much about the recycling program or would add some teeth to its policy. This seems more like a policy made to check a box than one to actually promote recycling.

Most of us put things in the weekly recycling bin that shouldn't be there. For example used pizza boxes books clear plastic salad containers foil wrapping paper gift bags plastic water bottles wax paper ribbons and bows should all be in trash cans not recycle bins.

See below for more information about what can and can't go in a recycle bin if you don't want to face those ""penalties.""

Ozzy Osbourne is kicking off this year’s NFL season with a half-time performance.

The 73-year-old will play on Thursday (08.09.22) during the Los Angeles Rams v Buffalo Bills game after undergoing a “life-altering surgery” back in June – a gig which follows his return to stage last month.

Held at California's SoFi Stadium Ozzy is set to perform a multi-song medley during the appearance.

The Los Angeles Rams announced the half-time performance on Twitter by writing: “Ready to rock for Thursday night football.”

Ozzy’s performance also leads up to the release of his new album ‘Patient Number 9’ due out later this year and featuring appearances from Red Hot Chilli Peppers’ Chad Smith Metallica’s Robert Trujillo and the Foo Fighters’ late Taylor Hawkins.

The rock survivor’s schedule is also packed as he is set to return to TV screens alongside his wife Sharon 69 in a new 10-part reality series ‘Home to Roost’ which focuses on their journey back home to the UK from America.

Ozzy who suffers Parkinson’s disease was discharged from a Los Angeles hospital in June after undergoing what Sharon called a “major” operation that would “determine the rest of his life”.

The rocker is also dealing with the fallout from a biking accident that left him with neck injuries later worsened by a 2019 fall that resulted in 15 screws being inserted into his back.

He recently told Entertainment Tonight about his health and missing seeing fans while at the Comic-Con in San Diego: “I like to see people you know. That’s been the hardest thing of the past three years because I’ve been trying to recover from my surgery.

“I’m getting there. It’s a slow climb back you know?”"

Leading transportation and handling company to leverage benefits of Gold OEM Partner status in both established markets and new opportunities.

Rockwell Automation Inc. the world’s largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation today announced that Canline Systems BV has joined the Rockwell Automation PartnerNetwork™ as a gold-level OEM.

Canline part of the Xano Group is an international specialist in the design and installation of complete turnkey transport and handling projects for metal packaging materials in food beverage and automotive. With projects across the globe it is a leader in the fields of conveying sorting and distributing using air magnetism and vacuum technologies.

Created to support OEMs across the globe Rockwell Automation’s comprehensive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Partner Program offers support for the design development and delivery of innovative equipment which incorporates Rockwell Automation solutions. All participants see it as a powerful strategic opportunity that supports and nurtures growth innovation and market potential.

Vincenzo Monaco EMEA OEM & Portfolio Marketing Manager at Rockwell Automation explains: “Canline is a company with obvious ambition and a willingness to adopt and deploy new technologies. As consumer demands evolve its end-user customers must keep pace with ever-changing market dynamics and Canline’s use of more agile and flexible contemporary automation solutions offers an answer to these needs.”

Paul Jonker Manager Control Systems at Canline elaborates:

“The markets we serve are well established but there is always room for further technical and operational gains especially by using modern digitalized technologies.

To be able to supply our customers with state-of-the-art technology and the latest developments we need to be in close contact with the market leaders in our field.

The cooperation with Rockwell provides us access to new developments first hand and helps us implementing them in our machinery”

Routeco Rockwell Automation’s authorized distributor in the Netherlands was instrumental in Canline’s elevation to gold level. Indeed this is the first OEM partnership led by a distributor in The Netherlands. Luc Op den Buijsch Routeco Netherland’s Country Director explains: “Rockwell Automation’s PartnerNetwork ecosystem both creates and supports business-growth opportunities for member companies. We were convinced that the timing was ideal for Canline to leverage these opportunities especially considering its reputation in the packaging segment and the demands the market is facing.”

In late 2020 Rockwell Automation evolved its OEM PartnerNetwork to establish levels of participation based on need and output. The program – now including almost 3500 machine builders worldwide – provides increased market-access opportunities simplification and standardized product alignment for manufacturers enabling participants to fully leverage Rockwell Automation technology. The company expects more platinum-level partners – as well as a number of gold silver and bronze – to join the program making it a world-class opportunity for original equipment manufacturers.

The all-cash transaction expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 marks the end of a five-year partnership between Thoma Bravo and Frontline during which Frontline was able to significantly grow its revenue according to a statement.

Neil Hunn CEO and President of Roper Technologies added: “The acquisition of Frontline demonstrates Roper's disciplined capital deployment strategy that focuses on identifying high-quality market-leading technology businesses that will enhance Roper's cash flow compounding.”

Cooley advised Frontline while Kirkland advised both Frontline and longtime client Thoma Bravo and Davis Polk acted for Roper Technologies.

Kirkland’s team was led by corporate partners Peter Stach and Ted Peto. The duo worked alongside associates Chad Rogers Brayton Deprey Maria Fay Karras Austin Fregene and Andrew Marshall. Cooley’s team was led by partners Miguel Vega and Michael Rohr as well as associate Nick Kenyon.

The Davis Polk corporate team was made up of partners John Amorosi and Michael Gilson counsel Jacob Kleinman and associates Allison First and Natasha Shah. The executive compensation team comprised partner Jennifer Conway and associate Justin Alexander Kasprisin with tax partner Kara Mungovan also working on the deal. The intellectual property and technology transactions team was made up of partner Frank Azzopardi and associate S. Dream Montgomery. The entire Davis Polk team is based in New York.

Mark Gruzin Frontline’s CEO said the acquisition marked the next phase of the company’s journey.

“We are deeply appreciative of Thoma Bravo's partnership over the last five years and the contributions from our dedicated team members which have allowed us to deliver an expanded portfolio of mission-critical solutions for our clients” he said.

The sale is the latest in a series of transactions in which Kirkland has acted for Chicago-based Thoma Bravo one of the largest private equity firms in the world with more than $114bn in assets. Kirkland teams also advised the company on its $6.9bn acquisition of identity security firm SalePoint in April and its purchase of business planning software company Anaplan for $10.4bn in March.

And last year Thoma Bravo hired veteran Kirkland partner Jerry Nowak as general counsel and chief administrative officer.

Bed Bath & Beyond has faced turbulence recently: Its shares made a monstrous run from $5.77 to $23.08 over a little more than two weeks in August in trading reminiscent of last year’s meme-stock craze when out-of-favor companies suddenly became darlings of smaller-pocketed investors.

Andrew here.

In 2018 after the Parkland shooting I wrote a series of articles about how credit card companies and banks played a critical role in financing mass shootings — and how they could help prevent these murders but have thus far decided to look the other way. A majority of shooters use credit and debit cards to acquire their guns ammunition and body armor — and the companies behind those card networks have a unique vantage point to spot suspicious buying patterns before law enforcement families or just about anyone else.

Since I wrote that series the financial industry has come up with new ways to make it even easier for mass shooters to get military-style weapons including “buy now pay later” financing. The teen who carried an AR-15 into Robb Elementary in Uvalde Texas which remains shuttered and will be demolished bought his gun using a bank debit card. Students in Uvalde return to classrooms today.

Back in 2018 I proposed that banks and credit card companies create a new “merchant category code” for gun-related transactions at stores that sell firearms which would allow them to flag suspicious activity. After all banks are legally obligated to scrub transactions to help identify domestic terrorism. Oddly enough while the financial industry uses distinct codes for dozens of different types of merchants there are none for gun stores.

Now a financial firm — Amalgamated Bank — has been working behind the scenes to make the idea a reality. The bank with the help of the advocacy group Guns Down America recently reapplied to I.S.O. the standards agency to create a new set of merchant category codes for gun sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL215YnVyYmFuay5jb20vc2VuYXRvci1wb3J0YW50aW5vLWhvbm9ycy1idXJiYW5rcy1ibGFzdC1mcm9tLXRoZS1wYXN0LWFzLXRoZS0yNXRoLXNlbmF0ZS1kaXN0cmljdC1zbWFsbC1idXNpbmVzcy1vZi10aGUteWVhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senator Portantino Honors Burbank's Blast From the Past as the 25th Senate District Small Business of the Year,"Blast from the Past a film and comic book collectible toy store in Burbank was honored by Senator Anthony J. Portantino as the Small Business of the Year for the 25th State Senate District. Store manager Duncan Barclay flew to Sacramento and accepted the award on behalf of the business.

In the heart of Magnolia Park is Blast from the Past. They are easily recognized by the two-story mural layered with film icons like Indiana Jones Frankenstein Darth Vader and Marty McFly. The front of the building dawns another mural this time with the heroes of Star Wars’ The Mandalorian. Established in 2004 owners Larry and Kathy Ross have created a store of nostalgia warehousing vintage toys and other memorabilia that excites customers of all ages.

“While there are other comic book stores toy stores and horror stores in the area we are the only small business that covers horror sci-fi super heroes pop culture Disney and more all under one roof” said Kathy Ross. “We also have friendly and knowledgeable staff members who are more than happy to share their wealth of knowledge and love of a variety of pop culture classics with our customers. We love to talk about the current movies and tv shows as well.”

Blast from the Past owners Kathy and Larry Ross.

Every year the California State Legislature and California Small Business Association celebrates the small businesses of the area. Senator Anthony J. Portantino recognized Blast from the Past this year for their contribution to the community and to the Magnolia Park Merchants Association where Kathy has been President for the last couple of years. “It is well-deserved and I am proud to have it in my district” said Senator Portantino who is a regular customer of the store and enjoys pop culture and memorabilia as well as their regular comedy nights. “The Rosses have created a social space that compliments the commercial enterprise and Burbank benefits from that successful effort. For me it’s a pleasure to enjoy appreciate and honor them for their community spirit and business spirit” he added.

The Rosses were very shocked when they got the call from Senator Portantino especially after learning how many cities were in the 25th District. Their commitment to the community is what made them stand out among the rest. As President of the Magnolia Park Merchants Association Kathy Ross works to build the Magnolia Park area in order to help promote the stores around her and unite the area together as a team. “When customers do have questions about Magnolia Park they will probably get more information than they wanted” said Ross. “I always know what is going on behind the scenes and can help make decisions that will benefit all of the small businesses in Magnolia Park.”

Not only is Blast from the Past a leader in Magnolia Park but they also stay community-minded by donating gift baskets to local schools and offer their parking lot for schools and organizations during street events. “Due to the size of our store we have also been able to host many event that are loved by the community one of which is our free stand-up comedy show on the second Friday of each month” added Ross.

Duncan Barclay attended the ceremony on behalf of the Rosses who were on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Ireland and Scotland. Barclay has been with Blast from the Past for over 14 years and helped the Rosses grow the store to what it is today. “All of us at Blast From the Past wish to express our honor for being chosen for this award and our sincerest thanks to senator Portantino” said Larry and Kathy Ross. “We would also like to thank all our loyal customers for your continued support and patronage through these difficult times.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NuZXdzLmNvbS9zYS1pbmMvYXJ0aWNsZS9Xb25kZXJsYW5kLW9mLXRoZS1BbWVyaWNhcy1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MtMTc0MTY0MDgucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wonderland of the Americas new business: What you need to know,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.expressnews.com/sa-inc/article/Wonderland-of-the-Americas-new-business-17416408.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NuZXdzLmNvbS9zYS1pbmMvYXJ0aWNsZS9Xb25kZXJsYW5kLW9mLXRoZS1BbWVyaWNhcy1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MtMTc0MTY0MDgucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As of September 2022 RCI reported that there is a total of 34819 crew aboard its 26 cruise ships meaning that each 3rd crew member is a newly hired employee.

In order to fill up many shipboard positions due to crew shortages Royal Caribbean International initiated a recruitment world tour this year.

Recruitment was also advertised in the crew areas on its ships calling up the crew to spread out the word to all friends and family who are interested to apply for the job openings.

It was not an easy task to pull out this extraordinary challenge and recruit so many professionals around the world. All hands were on deck from the company’s leadership to the onboard management recruiting partners and online applications.

The recruitment dive in April saw thousands of new recruits hired by the company. Back then RCI send its top managers to:

• The Balkans attended by Amadeo Fusco Traveling F&B Director

• South Africa attended by Catharina Maritz - Traveling F&B Director

• St Lucia attended by Naomi Celaire - Manager Hotel Operations

• Mexico City Mexico - attended by Andrew Trabosh Director Operational Excellence

• Mauritius - attended by Dominique Gamba Fleet Director Restaurant Operations

• Mumbai India – attended by Linken Dsouza VP Food & Beverage

In May RCI announced that the company has hired 600 crew at the recruiting fair in Gambia attended by Andrea Chessa Recruiting Manager Bulk & Hiring Partners Shipboard at Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

In June Barbados Tourism Marketing in partnership with the Royal Caribbean Group hosted a three-day national recruitment drive in Barbados which gathered about 500 people interested to join the cruise industry.

In July over 600 Trinidad and Tobago nationals took to the seas for the first time as employees of Royal Caribbean. Just over a month since thousands flocked to Royal Caribbean's recruitment drives in Trinidad and Tobago the cruise line has confirmed that 602 candidates have been hired so far.

Hiring new crews is just the first step in the process however once aboard they needed to be trained in order to get familiar with the brand standards policies and procedures. This process was achieved with programs designed by RCI as well as the guidance of the ship's middle management and seasoned crew members. The teams make sure every new crew member feels valued welcomed and receives the guidance and training they need to succeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaXRoc29uaWFubWFnLmNvbS9zbWFydC1uZXdzL2NydWlzZS1zaGlwcy1hcmUtYWRkaW5nLXNwYWNleHMtc3Rhcmxpbmstc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWludGVybmV0LTE4MDk4MDY4OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX's Starlink Satellite Internet Is Coming to Cruise Ships,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaXRoc29uaWFubWFnLmNvbS9zbWFydC1uZXdzL2NydWlzZS1zaGlwcy1hcmUtYWRkaW5nLXNwYWNleHMtc3Rhcmxpbmstc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWludGVybmV0LTE4MDk4MDY4OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167120B5C90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaXRoc29uaWFubWFnLmNvbS9zbWFydC1uZXdzL2NydWlzZS1zaGlwcy1hcmUtYWRkaW5nLXNwYWNleHMtc3Rhcmxpbmstc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWludGVybmV0LTE4MDk4MDY4OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vcGVvcGxlLW9waW5pb25zL3Zpcmdpbi12b3lhZ2VzLXN2cC1kaWFuYS1ibG9jay1nYXJjaWEtcmV0aXJpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virgin Voyages' SVP Diana Block Garcia is retiring,"VP Juan Trescastro will now lead itinerary destinations and government affairs while Jessica Fleisher AVP sales strategy & distribution will move to oversee revenue and pricing leadership.

Where the Shark Attack Took Place

(Image via Google Maps)

One family’s vacation was marred by tragedy when a 58-year-old woman was attacked by a bull shark while on a snorkeling excursion. The incident occurred at a popular destination known as Green Cay just off the shore of Rose Island at approximately 2 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon. The woman was rushed to the hospital but did not survive the injuries she had sustained.

According to NBC News approximately 5-7 other people were snorkeling with the unidentified woman. During a news conference Royal Bahamas Police Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said that family members had witnessed the attack and helped to pull the victim from the water. She was then taken by boat to Fort Montagu Hospital.

Bull sharks — which typically run between 7.5 and 11 feet in length — are naturally aggressive. Because they favor shallow coastal waters (as do snorkelers) they are the type of shark most often associated with attacks on humans.

Royal Caribbean Offering Family Support

Harmony of the Seas

In confirming the news Royal Caribbean said that the woman had been a passenger aboard Harmony of the Seas which is in the midst of a seven-night sailing out of Port Canaveral Florida. The cruise line indicated that the woman was on an independent shore excursion meaning one that was not sold through or sanctioned by the line itself. This is of course not at all uncommon as many cruise guests — no matter the destination — often make plans with independent contractors.

In a statement Royal Caribbean Group added that they were “providing support and assistance to the guest’s loved ones during this difficult time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8veml6b25saW5lLmNvbS9zdC1raXR0cy10b3VyaXNtLWF1dGhvcml0eS1hbmQtcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWdyb3VwLWhvc3RzLWEtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1zdW1tZXItY3J1aXNlLXdvcmtzaG9wL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8veml6b25saW5lLmNvbS9hbXAvc3Qta2l0dHMtdG91cmlzbS1hdXRob3JpdHktYW5kLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1ncm91cC1ob3N0cy1hLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtc3VtbWVyLWNydWlzZS13b3Jrc2hvcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Kitts Tourism Authority and Royal Caribbean Group Hosts A Successful Summer Cruise Workshop,"Basseterre St. Kitts September 5 2022 (SKTA) – The St. Kitts Tourism Authority in partnership with Royal Caribbean Group facilitated a Summer Group Workshop in preparation for the upcoming 2022-2023 cruise season.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

(The answer might surprise you),"When I led sustainability at Facebook we were regularly challenged to ask ourselves what we would do if we weren’t afraid. In the wake of an epic battle over historic climate legislation I feel like asking that same question of Facebook (now Meta) Google (another former employer) Apple and Amazon all of whom were silent at this critical moment — and let their trade associations attack the bill. Of the five Big Tech companies only Microsoft endorsed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — very softly through an intermediary before the bill passed and then Google did so after the signing.

What were they afraid of? We’ll get to that in a moment.

For employees of these Big Tech firms for whom climate change is an existential threat this continued silence on bold public policy seems disconnected from the companies they think they know with their constant talk about internal sustainability efforts and reducing emissions and their increasingly visible presence at the IPCC annual COP meetings. For the past 2½ years ClimateVoice has been working to lift the voices of these Big Tech employees and last year — knowing a big policy battle was brewing — we launched an employee-focused campaign to urge the top 5 U.S. tech companies to step up their game on climate policy.

As the Build Back Better Act (with a huge $555 billion investment in climate) slowly wound its way through the congressional labyrinth last year we urged companies to support it strongly and we scored where they stood. All five Big Tech companies endorsed the climate provisions albeit weakly while trade associations savaged the bill with media attacks. When Build Back Better met its demise though not all business leaders gave up hope on pushing climate policy forward. Some took a very proactive path speaking up for the climate provisions that were still in play with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia).

I’ve written before about the example set by another leading tech firm — Salesforce — which loudly spoke up throughout the spring. Salesforce endorsed the IRA days after its introduction in an article focused on the tech sector’s silence on the legislation. It took another week for Microsoft to softly whisper their support for the IRA as its founder Bill Gates was getting ready to publish a powerful op-ed backing the bill.

The chamber is well known for its obstructionist tactics on climate bills and this latest policy showdown was no exception.

What is holding Big Tech back on offering full-throttle support for bold climate policy? Protocol zoomed in on the IRA’s tax provisions as one likely concern. A last-minute provision taxing stock buybacks was definitely on Big Tech’s radar. In the bigger picture though Protocol’s coverage also unearthed the most important political obstacle: the pernicious role of trade associations. All three powerful trade associations that represent these companies — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable — were quick to come out against the IRA.

These trade associations still represent Big Tech. All of the Big Five — except Apple which left years ago under the leadership of the late Steve Jobs — still belong to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is well known for its obstructionist tactics on climate bills and this latest policy showdown was no exception. In a last-ditch attempt to flip Sen. Kyrsten Sinema the U.S. and Arizona chambers ran a desperate ad at the eleventh hour. As history will show they failed. A crack has appeared in the trade associations’ wall of invincibility. It is time to make that crack a fissure and get these powerful companies to stand up forcefully against the obstruction from these umbrella groups.

In the wake of the IRA’s passage we see how critical this turning point was to our future on this planet. Record-breaking summer heat across the globe devastating fires and floods and now news of rapid warming in the Arctic — there is no end to the ominous signs that we must push forward and use policy to scale decarbonization rapidly across our entire economy.

It’s important to keep in mind that the IRA represents a beginning not an end. Its passage has ushered in an era when bold climate policy — at the federal state and local levels — will speed and shape our transition to our clean energy future. It would be great to get Big Tech to turn away from their fears — and their destructive trade associations — and join us in this fight. Their employees will be watching to see whether they do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlc2VsbGVyLmNvLm56L2FydGljbGUvMTMwMDU3NC9raXdpLXNhbGVzZm9yY2UtcGFydG5lcnMtcGxheS12aXRhbC1wYXJ0LWluLWNhcHR1cmluZy10cmVtZW5kb3VzLWdyb3d0aC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kiwi Salesforce partners play vital part in capturing 'tremendous' growth,"Salesforce sees ""tremendous opportunity for growth"" on New Zealand shores with the drive and the need for digitisation of all business continuing strongly post-pandemic with partners playing a vital part.

This opportunity allowed the students to get a first-hand experience of how a company works on a day-to-day basis.

Some of the organizations that hosted Texas A&M at Qatar interns include Schlumberger North Oil Company (NOC) Facilities Management and Maintenance Company (FMM) Hassad Food Ooredoo Qatar Petrochemical Company (QAPCO) Siemens Energy Xylem Qatar within the country and The Solar Company in Egypt and Turkish Aerospace Academy in Turkey.

The Texas A&M at Qatar interns said that being mentored by experts from the industry was an enlightening experience.

Talking about his internship at the Turkish Aerospace Academy Yousuf Darwish a mechanical engineering student said “My experience at Turkish Aerospace was very enriching. It was interesting to see the different kinds of helicopters fighter jets and drones. We had the chance to work with a dedicated group of engineers in the additive manufacturing department where we learned a lot. I had the chance to learn Turkish and learn a lot about the Turkish culture. Overall it was a very fulfilling experience.”

Faisal Ashour a chemical engineering student said “This summer I had a fulfilling six-week internship at NOC where I learned about the oil and gas industry and the Al Shaheen field which produces approximately 45 percent of Qatar’s oil production. I interned as a process engineer with an amazing team where I used many of my chemical engineering skills and knowledge from Texas A&M at Qatar on the upstream processes of NOC’s offshore platforms. The tasks I was assigned to created and developed crucial process engineering skills that have advanced my growth as a chemical engineer”.”

Schlumberger welcomed 12 students this summer — the largest cohort of Texas A&M at Qatar interns placed in an organization this internship season.

Farah Shabbir an electrical engineering student said “Interning at Schlumberger gives an insight into how the industry works. It makes you realize how much effort every employee puts in every day. I was also thrilled to see many Texas A&M at Qatar alumni working there. You feel proud seeing one of your own there and it feels comforting to have a few familiar faces in that community.”

Zaina Aloudeh a petroleum engineering student said “The phenomenal mentorship and support I got from my supervisors and team at Schlumberger has helped me understand how the organization works and how I can contribute when I join the work force.”

According to Daniel Vemagiri Marbaniang talent acquisition manager - Qatar at Schlumberger the students from Texas A&M at Qatar were equipped to work efficiently and contribute right from the first day. He said “At Schlumberger we are helping unlock energy for the benefit of all. This can only be achieved through innovative ideas and fresh perspectives from bright and inquisitive minds. This mindset is exemplified in the brilliant students of Texas A&M Qatar in both the junior students who successfully completed an internship with us as well as the batch of recent graduates who are starting their dynamic careers in Schlumberger. Our people have always been our greatest asset and we are excited to see that the future of energy is in great hands.”

Apart from putting their engineering knowledge into practice students explored challenging work practices taking ownership and responsibility of tasks enhancing interpersonal skills and working independently as part of a team. They received specific job-related training and were exposed to diverse environments and work cultures.

Dr. Hassan S. Bazzi senior associate dean for research and advancement at Texas A&M University at Qatar said “We are committed towards developing engineering leaders who can have a direct positive impact on the country. These internships give us the opportunity to showcase the high quality of students enrolled at Texas A&M at Qatar thus giving potential employers a glimpse of what to expect. It gives our students a valuable opportunity to get a first-hand experience of what being an engineer in the field is like and it provides additional engineering resources for the organizations where our students intern. We are proud to partner with many of the leading companies in Qatar for our internship program.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvMi1vaWwtc3RvY2tzLXBvaXNlZC10by1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tb3BlY3MtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1jdXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SLB HES: These Oil Stocks Could Benefit from OPEC's Production Cuts - TipRanks.com,"Just a month after raising oil production by 100000 barrels per day OPEC is set to make a U-turn toward August production levels via a token production cut of the same volume throughout October. The decision will most likely have a positive impact on oil stocks like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES).

Why Is OPEC Cutting Oil Production?

Until a few hours ago OPEC was expected to keep oil production steady this year partly due to the resistance from Russia against an oil production reduction and partly because the cartel agreed to raise production by 100000 barrels just last month. It turns out that the OPEC did after all defy Russia in a surprise move.

Russia which is selling its oil to Asian countries at discounted rates after being shunned by the West had strongly opposed the production cut arguing that oil-consuming countries will immediately assume that the cuts are due to a supply surplus in the world. This sentiment can damage Russia’s leverage with its Asian buyers.

However OPEC has a wider view in mind which drove the decision. Last week in a meeting OPEC discussed the implications of a demand drop fueled by recession and another unpredictable bout of COVID-19 lockdowns in major nations. The group predicted that for the rest of this year and the next the world is expected to experience a supply surplus of about 900000 barrels a day as a result of the demand slowdown. Thus a cut in production makes sense to reduce this surplus.

Coming to why this production target is critical to determining global oil prices the United States Energy Information Administration reveals that OPEC members constitute about 40% of the world’s crude oil production. Additionally export volumes from OPEC members make up about 60% of the total internationally traded petroleum. The sheer dominance in the market leads OPEC’s production decisions to influence oil prices.

Other Developments in the Oil Sector

Apart from the supply-trimming move by OPEC another hope at better global oil supply was stymied when plans to revive the West’s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in which sanctions of the latter country would be lifted to allow oil trade ran into a complication.

Last Friday the White House denied Iran’s request for a closure of investigations by the U.N. nuclear watchdog. This means that the West has to wait longer for the U.S. and Iran to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement before Iran can begin exporting oil again and improve global supply.

Back home a Wall Street Journal research also found out that the Biden administration has leased out the lowest area of land for oil drilling during the President’s first 19 months in office. This reduces the chances of the U.S. becoming self-reliant in producing oil.

Not to mention the Russia-Ukraine war shows no sign of stopping soon sustaining the global shortage of gas supply.

Overall lower production of oil both internationally and domestically puts the responsibility of meeting domestic oil demand on the shoulders of a handful of companies. This opens up solid opportunities for the following oil stocks.

Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)

Global energy company Hess Corporation primarily engages in the exploration production refining and marketing of crude oil natural gas liquid and natural gas. Tailwinds in the energy sector this year have led to the HES stock appreciating about 59% year-to-date.

Moreover during the second quarter Hess also brought 50 wells demonstrating its efforts to increase production. The company expects to ramp up its production rates in the Bakken region to about 200000 barrels per day by 2024.

Is HES Stock a Buy?

Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai recently maintained a Buy rating on the stock saying that the initial concerns that the Alternative Minimum Tax will adversely impact oil exploration companies that are considered to be tax “safe-havens” are proving to be useless. This is because despite the tax companies like Hess are comfortably maintaining strong cash flow yields.

Wall Street has a firm conviction that Hess has a long road uphill ahead. HES stock enjoys a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys and one Hold. On average Hess’ target price stands at $140.22 indicating an upside of 16% from current price levels.

Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB)

Oilfield services company Schlumberger’s technology and solutions for the production drilling and processing of crude oil and natural gas has served the oil and gas industry for 96 years. Exploration and offshore activity have picked up pace in recent months keeping the demand for the company’s offerings steadily high.

The company recently increased its full-year revenue expectations on the back of likely traction in a multi-year upcycle.

Further in its commitment to environmental cleanliness Schlumberger introduced its new business in March the Schlumberger End-to-end Emissions Solutions whose technology will help the oil and gas industry achieve methane-free oil production. This has garnered the interest of environmentalist investors recently.

Moreover as the global shortage of gas triggers more production activities in domestic exploration companies the demand for Schlumberger’s technologies is likely to remain high.

Is SLB Stock a Buy or Sell?

In July Evercore ISI analyst James West reiterated a Buy rating on SLB stock and raised the price target to $54 $51. In addition the Wall Street consensus is bullish on SLB with a Strong Buy rating supported by 11 Buys. Schlumberger’s stock price prediction points at an average price target of $50.82 which indicates upside potential of 33.49%.

Conclusion: Oil Will Always Get Back Up on Its Feet

Presently the commodities market is volatile with a lot happening in the oil and gas sector. The oil supply crunch that is pushing oil prices up (further fueling global inflation) might be having a positive effect on oil stocks now. However experts are of the opinion that if a recession hits the economy will take oil demand down with it. This might pose as a near-term concern for oil companies. However going by history oil demand always manages to regain its strength.

The world still has a long way to go before the automobile sector and other oil-guzzling industries can fully replace oil with alternative forms of energy. Thus it can be safe to say that fundamentally strong oil companies like Hess and Schlumberger can make for good long-term investment choices.

The Eighth Appellate District in Cuyahoga County reversed a trial court decision that found there was no coverage because the order by the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California was not an award of damages. The appellate panel said the term “damages” should be interpreted broadly to the benefit of the insured.

The court noted that a California appellate court had ruled in favor of paint manufacturer NL Industries in a similar lawsuit against Lloyds’ underwriters.

“Just as the NL I court found we find that an ordinary businessperson reading the policies at issue would believe that the abatement fund constitutes ‘damages’ under the relevant policy language” the opinion says.

The dispute stems from a public nuisance lawsuit filed by several California counties against Sherwin-Williams NL and ConAgra Grocery Products Co. for marketing the use of lead paint in interiors despite their knowledge that it would eventually degrade chip off and present a public health hazard. After all appeals were completed the legal action resulted in a settlement that requires each of the companies to pay $101.7 million into an abatement fund.

Sherwin-Williams sued Lloyd’s seeking coverage but the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas agreed with the insurer’s argument that the abatement order does not amount to “damages” that are covered by the policy.

The appellate panel disagreed. The opinion says even though the Santa Clara County court issued an “abatement order” rather than an “award of damages” the effect is the same.

The Ohio appellate court noted that the California Court of Appeal had provided “thoughtful insight into the ‘damages’ conundrom” and found in favor of coverage. Another case tried in New York and known as NL II also was decided in favor of the insured.

“Turning to the case at hand we note that under Ohio law ‘damages’ in its plain and ordinary meaning is necessarily broad enough to encompass a variety of remedies including compensatory damages injunctive relief restitution and other equitable relief” the opinion says.

The decision doesn’t put an end to the lawsuit; it decides only the question of whether the California court order amounts to “damages” covered by the policy. The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court to proceed toward trial.

Even consumption of small amounts of food allergens can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems hives and swollen airways. In some people a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction is known as anaphylaxis. For example in the US nearly 3% of the adult population suffers from shellfish allergy.

To estimate the size of the market Technavio has tracked the recent trends and developments in the dog food market. The analysts at Technavio have considered various aspects such as the consumer base adoption rate average selling price revenue generated by vendors and various other factors to estimate the market size. Download Sample PDF Report Here to get an idea of the overall scope of the full report.

Technavio has announced its latest market research report titled Global Dog Food Market 2022-2026

The report on the dog food market by Technavio expects the market size to increase at a CAGR of 4.27% and register an incremental growth of USD 12.84 billion between 2021 and 2026. However the growth forecast could be missed with the market growing slower than expected if the following factors come into play: changing lifestyle patterns and busy work lives of the urban populace and limited choice of frozen foods.

According to Technavio the growth of the market is primarily driven by increasing pet health awareness.

With rising disposable incomes people are more inclined to provide a better lifestyle for their pets. They are learning about how to better take care and feed an animal. This has increased the awareness of pet health among consumers which is driving the demand for pet food that is free from grains dyes sugar preservatives and other chemical additives. All these factors are expected to foster the growth of the market during the forecast period.

""Rise in product visibility and accessibility through online retailing and increasing focus on manufacturing clean-label pet foods will further accelerate the growth of the market"" says an analyst at Technavio.

The market structure is fragmented. The market has the presence of several global regional and local vendors. Additionally factors such as the low cost of switching products for buyers high product perishability high exit barriers and high fixed cost requirements intensify the threat of rivalry in the market. As a result the threat of rivalry was moderate in 2021 and it is expected to remain the same during the forecast period.

The report breaks down the market into the following segments:

Product: dry dog food dog treats and wet dog food

Geography: North America  Europe  APAC MEA and South America

Based on the product the dry dog food segment is expected to create more revenue in the market. The segment is driven by the increasing focus of vendors on offering dog food products in attractive packaging and other packaging innovations. In addition vendors operating in the segment are adopting strategies such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and product innovations to expand their consumer base. This will further drive the growth of the segment.

In terms of region North America will emerge as the dominant region occupying 33% of the global market share. The regional market is mainly driven by the increasing production of clean-label pet food products and the move toward innovative and sustainable packaging materials by manufacturers.

SNA,Snap-on,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbXVzaWNhbGx5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA1L3NuYXAtdG8tc2h1dC1kb3duLXZvaXNleS1hbmQtcmV0cmVhdC1mcm9tLXdlYjMtZXhwZXJpbWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snap to shut down Voisey and retreat from web3 experiments,"We reported last week on Snapchat parent company Snap’s plans to lay off around 20% of its employees. More details have since emerged of how the cuts affect specific teams within Snap’s empire.

In a memo to staff CEO Evan Spiegel noted that the company had “started the process of winding down the standalone applications Zenly and Voisey”. The latter is what’s relevant to Music Ally: it’s the music-focused short-video app that Snap acquired in November 2020. The app had made its name as a way for people to sing or rap over a library of beats and loops to create original tracks.

Note the ‘standalone application’ element of the shutdown: Voisey’s tech (and perhaps team) may well continue to play a role in the main Snapchat app in the future.

Meanwhile Snap’s experiments in web3 are also taking a hit from the cutbacks with the team responsible having also been ‘sunsetted’. One of its members revealed the news on Twitter with Bloomberg securing official confirmation and a statement from Snap that “early explorations in the web3 space represent a project that doesn’t directly contribute to our priority and continued investment in AR”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXphYmV0aHRvbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNi9hLWxpZmUtbGl2ZWQtZ2xhZHlzLWJ1cnJvdWdoLXRvdWNoZWQtbWFueS1saXZlcy1ieS1oZXItY2hyaXN0aWFuLWxpdmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Life Lived: Gladys Burrough touched many lives by her Christian living,"A Life Lived: Gladys Burrough touched many lives by her Christian living Published 1:21 pm Tuesday September 6 2022

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

In Ecclesiastes 9:10 we are told: “Whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might.”

Gladys Burrough found joy in doing for others. She was a people person who enjoyed being with people both young and old. Until she became disabled Gladys worked in the nursery at Biltmore Baptist Church and taught the small children. She was also church pianist for a number of years. Growing up she attended Northside Baptist Church. She also often attended church with her husband Carl at First Christian Church Elizabethton. Faith and worship were an important part of Gladys’ life. It was the reason behind so many things she did.

Gladys died August 6 at the age of 71.

Carl said Gladys was a wonderful wife to him and a friend to so many. She enjoyed people and helping others. “She and her sister Dare cooked and fed so many people especially neighbors and friends when they were sick. She enjoyed cooking and sharing with others” said Carl.

Gladys retired from Snap-on Tools after 35 years of service. In her younger years she had worked for a brief time at the old Carter County Memorial Hospital and Carter County Bank. Additionally she was a member of the Carter County Crewettes and helped with many of their projects and activities. “While working at Snap-on and after her retirement she and a number of co-workers would get together once a month and go out to eat. That was something she looked forward to” said Carl who worked for the Elizabethton Police Department for many years.

In addition to her work outside the home Gladys was a good housekeeper. “She kept our home clean and neat. She enjoyed working in the house as well as outside. She often helped me with the yard work and she enjoyed flowers” said Carl.

He has fond memories of his wife. “At the end of every day she sat down and read her Bible and she always prayed before meals. She was a good Christian lady. In all the years that I was married to her I never heard her say a dirty word. And rarely did she get upset” Carl shared.

Gladys spent much of her time doing for others but she did like to travel some. “She enjoyed visiting my sister in Las Vegas Nev. and she had a sister in Indiana whom she visited some” said Carl. “But for the most part she enjoyed being at home and when we weren’t working we just enjoyed spending time together. She was very supportive of me. She was by my side 50 years” shared Carl.

Gladys came from a family of nine children — five girls and four boys. Two of her brothers preceded her in death as did a sister. “A sister Dare was just like a mother to Gladys. They were very close and did a lot of things together” Carl said.

Gladys Burrough was one of those people who did a lot of things for others but she didn’t make a lot of fuss about it. If there was a need she did something about it not just talk about it. She didn’t wear her Christianity on her sleeve for others to see she quietly lived it by serving others.

Gladys Burrough has gone to her heavenly reward but she will not soon be forgotten. She made her mark while on this earth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTExODU3NjkvUGFyaXMtRnVyeS1zaGFyZXMtc3dlZXQtc25hcC1odXNiYW5kLVR5c29uLXNvbnMtZW5qb3ktV1dFLW1hdGNoLUNhcmRpZmYuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTExODU3NjkvYW1wL1BhcmlzLUZ1cnktc2hhcmVzLXN3ZWV0LXNuYXAtaHVzYmFuZC1UeXNvbi1zb25zLWVuam95LVdXRS1tYXRjaC1DYXJkaWZmLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paris Fury shares sweet snap with husband Tyson and their sons as they enjoy WWE match in Cardiff,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dailymail.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tvshowbiz/article-11185769/Paris-Fury-shares-sweet-snap-husband-Tyson-sons-enjoy-WWE-match-Cardiff.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671094C460>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTExODU3NjkvUGFyaXMtRnVyeS1zaGFyZXMtc3dlZXQtc25hcC1odXNiYW5kLVR5c29uLXNvbnMtZW5qb3ktV1dFLW1hdGNoLUNhcmRpZmYuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTExODU3NjkvYW1wL1BhcmlzLUZ1cnktc2hhcmVzLXN3ZWV0LXNuYXAtaHVzYmFuZC1UeXNvbi1zb25zLWVuam95LVdXRS1tYXRjaC1DYXJkaWZmLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvYmluZGktaXJ3aW4taG9ub3Vycy1sYXRlLWRhZC0yNzkwNzcxNdIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvYmluZGktaXJ3aW4taG9ub3Vycy1sYXRlLWRhZC0yNzkwNzcxNS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bindi Irwin honours late dad Steve Irwin in sweet tribute on anniversary of his death,"Bindi Irwin paid a sweet tribute to dad Steve Irwin on the 16th anniversary of his death after being stung by a stingray in 2006

Steve Irwin's daughter Bindi has paid an emotional to the Crocodile Hunter star on the 16th anniversary of his death.

The 24-year-old has followed in her dad's footsteps with his love for wild animals and took to Instagram on Sunday to share how his love for animals also lives through her daughter.

Bindi opened up to her 4.9 million followers to share her heartfelt words alongside a snap of her and her dad on a late-night adventure as she proudly held a baby alligator. She also shared the sweet nickname she refers him to to her daughter 17-month-old Grace who she shares with husband Chandler Powell.

She wrote: ""Grandpa Crocodile I know you would’ve been the most incredible grandfather because you were such an extraordinary dad. Thank you for being an amazing guardian angel for Grace.""

Fans were quick to share their appreciation for the family in the comments section of the post. One user wrote: ""You carry all his love with you now.""

Another penned: ""He gave this world such a gift by sharing his life with us. I'm sure Grace will think of him as a superhero as she grows and she'll be right. He was extraordinary and so are you.""

And a third said: ""Your father will be proud of who you are right now.""

Steve died in 2006 at the age of 44 after a stingray barb stabbed him in the chest while he was filming for a wildlife documentary. Bindi was aged eight at the time.

I cherish all the good times with my dad and feel grateful to be able to keep his memory and legacy alive.""

Their posts come a week after Bindi had uploaded another sweet video of her daughter. The clip showed Grace walking up to a mural of Steve his wife and a koala bear.

She captioned the post: ""Tears in my eyes as I share this video. We call my mum and dad Bunny and Grandpa Crocodile with Grace. She loves them (and koalas) dearly.

When people ask me to suggest a quality “under the radar” Oregon winery the first word from my mouth is always “Brigadoon.” The Junction City winery is where Chris and Sheree Shown along with their winemaker son Matt work their magic.

Thankfully unlike the mythical Scottish village of the same name Brigadoon’s tasting room opens more frequently than once every 100 years.

Brigadoon Wine Co. is known for: “My dad” Matt Shown said. “The first five years that the tasting room was open he was behind the counter for 99% of the shifts.”

Shown said that because of the presence of his dad and his mother’s fantastic parmesan cheese crackers in the tasting room few people realized he had been making the family’s wines from the beginning. “I was an afterthought. ‘When did you start making the wines?’ was a question I’d get all the time Shown said.

HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok

I can’t blame those people for their oversight because his dad is quite a storyteller and his mom’s crackers will cast a spell on you.

I should also add that Brigadoon produces some of the best rieslings in all of Oregon.

A “must try” current release: 2021 Brigadoon Wine Co. “Lylee” Pinot Noir ($26).

The last vintage of this wine was a superb pinot noir value. Citing its “generous fruit” Shown thinks his 2021 “Lylee” is even better.

Innovation: The Shown family has a rootstock and scion wood nursery on their property not something you typically see at a winery.

Rootstock is the below-ground portion of the grapevine that works to keep the scion wood productive. The scion wood is the above-ground part of the vine that produces the fruit.

For various reasons vineyard owners began steadily moving away from “own-rooted” grapevines to grafting scion wood onto rootstock. The Showns capitalized on that trend by growing and selling rootstock/scion to nursery customers across the country. At the peak of their business in 2005 the Showns were selling 200000 cuttings a year.

History: The Shown family wine history does not begin in Oregon. Richard Shown Chris’ dad and Matt’s grandfather first started dabbling with winemaking in a bomb shelter he built in his backyard in Santa Clara California.

In the late 1960s the bomb shelter was vacated when the family went commercial and set up shop near Rutherford as Shown & Sons Vineyards. The Shown’s Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon frequently earned high praise from the critics.

When Shown & Sons closed the winery and vineyard were sold to Joe Heitz who changed the name to Heitz Cellar Trailside Vineyard.

In 1990 with a good deal of viticultural experience under his belt Chris Shown moved his family to Oregon. In 1991 Chris and Sheree Shown purchased a timber property where they built Brigadoon’s winery and tasting room.

Early on Chris Shown’s day job was managing another vineyard in the Junction City area. Taking what his son called a “weekend warrior” approach it took Shown 15 years to plant 15 acres of grapevines. In fact Brigadon’s vineyard wasn’t completed until one year after the winery was finished in 2008.

What we don’t know: Chris Shown was an enthusiastic rugby hooker in college.

Key insight: Matt Shown said that many Willamette Valley winery owners talked about “surveying the valley for the best possible place to grow pinot noir.” His dad took a different approach.

“He looked for a piece of land that he could afford where he could raise a family and live a happy life. His vision wasn’t necessarily grand but it was pure” Shown said.

Biggest success so far: Matt Shown said that while it wasn’t always easy early on he thinks his biggest success is getting to work all day with his dad and now that she’s retired from teaching his mom. “Most people say they could never work with their parents and I get that. But we’ve made it work” Shown said.

A “must visit” spot near Brigadoon: After the wine and crackers Matt Shown recommends driving 20 minutes north of Brigadoon to visit the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge.

The wildlife refuge features beautiful scenery wetlands trails elk migrating birds and what Shown said is “an opportunity to glimpse what the Willamette Valley looked like 20 years ago.”

Where to buy: In addition to purchasing from the winery Brigadoon’s wines are available at The Broadway Wine Merchants in Eugene The Good Drop Wine Shoppe in Bend Vino Veritas in Portland and Made in Oregon stores.

Port Moresby – Following conflict and election-related violence more than 15000 people have been internally displaced in Hela Southern Highlands and Enga provinces according to the International Organization for Migration´s (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).

IOM in partnership with the local authorities deployed the DTM team from 13-30 August 2022 to track and monitor the internal displacement and identify the needs including protection of those most affected by the violence in the Highlands region. The total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is expected to rise as assessments in hard-to-access provinces continue. Access to several locations remains limited due to security concerns.

Food water and sanitation shelter health and protection were identified as the most immediate needs. IOM is scaling up emergency support to assist affected communities.

Violence began in May before the general election in July and has continued through August 2022. Clashes during the several-day period of the election were the most severe. While the violence is directly related to the general election in most areas in some places long-standing issues including land disputes retribution and unsettled disputes between clans have reignited conflicts during a time of instability.

Affected communities are reporting injuries deaths damages to food gardens destruction of property displacement and disruption of education services.

In Porgera Laiagam and Kompiam districts from Enga province Margarima district from Hela province and Nipa district from Southern Highland Province almost half of the total population (264590 people or 49175 households) have been affected by the ongoing conflict and election-related violence.

In Enga it is estimated that 25700 school-aged children are unable to attend school and are facing a range of vulnerabilities. The direct impact of this violence is a surge in trauma cases particularly among victims of violence including sexual violence.

The closing of health centres due to attacks or the absence of staff will also result in almost 558000 people having no access to health care. Persons who require long-term treatment such as HIV and tuberculosis patients and people with non-communicable diseases will not be able to access the medication they need for indefinite periods.

IOM in partnership with the National Disaster Centre and with support from USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) and the Australian Government will be delivering emergency assistance to the affected and most vulnerable population including women persons living with disabilities and the elderly.

""We hope that the aid being provided by IOM with the generous contributions of our donors will alleviate some of the suffering and agony of the affected people among whom are many women children girls and boys the elderly and persons with disabilities"" said Serhan Aktoprak IOM Chief of Mission in Papua New Guinea.

Assistance materials pre-positioned for immediate delivery include shelter kits (consisting of tarpaulins nails hammers and ropes) collapsible water containers water treatment tablets mosquito nets and other emergency items.

IOM has so far been able to distribute in Mendi Southern Highlands Province shelter kits to a total of 236 affected households benefiting 1413 persons. A further seven households (56 individuals) received water containers. Most of the beneficiaries were women and children.

Funded by USAID/BHA and United Nations Peacebuilding Fund the DTM tool provides response actors with critical data to inform evidence-based response and recovery planning targeting affected communities.

After a turbulent two years for the airline industry Southwest Airlines' new CEO Bob Jordan is hoping to pilot the company into smoother skies. On Tuesday Jordan who's been with the company for over 33 years and was most recently the vice president of corporate services replaced outgoing CEO Gary Kelly. Kelly is now the executive chairman ending his more than 17-year tenure as the company's leader.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Like its competitors Southwest Airlines is left to recoup after a difficult pandemic season. Its stock is down approximately 17% compared to five years ago. Insider asked airline industry veterans and analysts where Jordan should invest the most energy in his first 100 days.

""Bob shouldn't do anything dramatic nor will he because Southwest is a good fine operating machine. It runs effectively very well"" David Banmiller a veteran airline executive with over 50 years of crisis management in the industry told Insider.

Hiring and retaining workers

The pandemic hit the airline industry hard. Many flight attendants pilots and staff were concerned about contracting COVID-19 or were exhausted from dealing with unruly passengers who refused to wear face masks per reports.

Jordan will have to address this need for workers head-on analysts said. The CEO has said the airline plans to hire 8000 people this year and to attract talent the company is raising minimum wages to $17 from $15 per hour which is higher than other airline minimum wages according to Payscale data.

Nawal Taneja an airline industry consultant who's written over 13 books on the industry said that raising wages for workers is a good start but increased salaries alone ""just isn't going to do it.""

Related stories

""There has to be a focus on engagement not with just customers but also employees"" Taneja told Insider. ""Leaders need to figure out what do employees want from their employer?""

Taneja shared examples of problems airlines face that impact productivity like a flight attendant saying they can't come into work because their child has COVID-19 or a pilot being delayed due to traffic to the airport. He suggested Jordan and other airline CEOs consult their employees more and consider questions like ""Do they need backup child care benefits or flexibility with their work schedules?"" and ""Do they need better transportation to the airport?""

Offsetting rising costs of fuel and technology

Inflated prices of fuel maintenance and airport fees mean that Southwest must figure out how to offset those costs ""without alienating customers who rely on their low fares"" said Helane Becker a managing director and senior research analyst at financial-services firm Cowen. Indeed Southwest's December 2021 Investor Day presentation listed low fares among the company's most important principles.

There are also increased costs associated with expanding into international markets. For one thing Jones said ""they're going to have to buy bigger airplanes."" Historically Southwest has operated only Boeing 737s which was a way to save money because the company could tailor both training and maintenance to one type of aircraft. Not to mention Southwest will have to start training its pilots and mechanics differently to fly larger aircraft.

Airline veteran consultant Banmiller agreed saying ""cost control"" would be high on his list if he were advising Jordan. He said Jordan should take a close look at the impact of inflation on costs and re-negotiate ""non-fuel"" expenses like airplane leases and airport fees with contractors.

Maintaining an employee-first culture

Southwest is known for its unique culture one that Lewis University dean and associate professor of aviation and transportation studies Robert ""R."" Eric Jones called ""employee-centric."" (Jones spent 15 years as a maintenance technician at Southwest.) ""Fun"" and ""family"" were always at the core of how Southwest operated Jones said.

Jordan's biggest challenge will be maintaining that culture even as the company tries to compete with large legacy airlines like Delta and United. It's similar to the problem many startups face when they start to scale and there are simply more people and processes to manage. ""The bigger that you get the harder it is to control that culture"" Jones said.

Another challenge to Southwest's workplace culture is executives' recent decision to lift its two-year ban on alcohol sales aboard planes. Lyn Montgomery president of TWU Local 556 which represents Southwest's flight attendants told Insider that the union is ""outraged"" at the resumption of alcohol sales on board saying it was ""unsafe and irresponsible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtY29tcGFuaW9uLXBhc3Mtc2luZ2xlLXJvdW5kLXRyaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Launches Special Single Round Trip Offer For Its Companion Pass,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtY29tcGFuaW9uLXBhc3Mtc2luZ2xlLXJvdW5kLXRyaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3BpcmVtb3JlLmNvbS9kYXVnaHRlci1mb2xsb3dzLWluLW1vbXMtZm9vdHN0ZXBzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1waWxvdC1ub3ctdGhleS1hcmUtZmx5aW5nLXRvZ2V0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daughter Follows In Mom's Footsteps To Become Pilot — Now They're Flying Together!,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.inspiremore.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /daughter-follows-in-moms-footsteps-to-become-pilot-now-they-are-flying-together/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167104A9B70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3BpcmVtb3JlLmNvbS9kYXVnaHRlci1mb2xsb3dzLWluLW1vbXMtZm9vdHN0ZXBzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1waWxvdC1ub3ctdGhleS1hcmUtZmx5aW5nLXRvZ2V0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Zyb250aWVyLWFpcmxpbmVzLWVuZGluZy1zZXJ2aWNlLWF0LWNvbG9yYWRvLXNwcmluZ3MtYWlycG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlXzc4ODFiNTRlLTJhZWQtMTFlZC04MjVlLWM3N2U1ZTZmMDJlNy5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZnJvbnRpZXItYWlybGluZXMtZW5kaW5nLXNlcnZpY2UtYXQtY29sb3JhZG8tc3ByaW5ncy1haXJwb3J0L2FydGljbGVfNzg4MWI1NGUtMmFlZC0xMWVkLTgyNWUtYzc3ZTVlNmYwMmU3LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frontier Airlines ending service at Colorado Springs Airport,"Frontier Airlines will halt flights to Colorado Springs on Nov. 4 Colorado Springs Airport officials announced Friday.

Jennifer de la Cruz senior director of corporate communications for the Denver-based low-fare carrier confirmed the move saying “We periodically review and update our routes based on demand seasonality and other factors. We continue to offer service to a wide range of destinations throughout the U.S. and internationally from Denver.”

Frontier operates nine flights a week from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas and Phoenix and carried 37220 passengers on outgoing flights in the first seven months of this year according to the latest monthly traffic report from the Colorado Springs Airport. That’s about 6% of the more than 600000 passengers who flew out of the airport during the seven-month period.

“While we are disappointed in their departure we remain hopeful for their return” airport officials said Friday in a statement that also noted that low-fare giant Southwest Airlines also offers nonstop flights to both cities served by Frontier.

Frontier was hit hard by Southwest’s expansion to Colorado Springs in March 2021 with 13 daily flights to Las Vegas Phoenix and three other cities. Through July of this year Frontier saw a nearly 30% drop in passenger traffic from the same period last year. Of the other four airlines serving the Springs American’s traffic so far this year is down nearly 12% from a year ago while passenger numbers for Delta Southwest and United all were up during the same period.

Frontier’s passenger numbers “have gone down and down over the past six to 12 months” said Greg Phillips the city director of aviation. “They offered a low price point and plenty of (fare) sales but in the end they weren’t fully successful in Colorado Springs.”

Frontier began serving Colorado Springs in 2008 and grew to become the airport’s second-largest carrier in 2012 before halting service the next year. Frontier returned to the state’s second-largest city in 2016 by offering a few flights a week to several cities.

Phillips said Frontier’s departure will create “opportunities and we will try to capitalize on those opportunities both with our existing carriers by trying to convince them to add more flights to the cities Frontier is serving and with other airlines that don’t currently serve Colorado Springs.” He cited Spirit Airlines which is being acquired by JetBlue; Alaska Airlines and startups Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways as possible targets.

“it’s like losing a member of the family and I hate that but once the decision was made we will press forward and capitalize on the opportunity” Frontier’s departure creates Phillips said. “We would welcome them back if they see an opportunity in Colorado Springs in the future.”

Despite Frontier’s departure and declines in passenger numbers in June and July from a year earlier Phillips said he still expects the airport’s traffic numbers to grow by nearly 100000 to 1.03 million this year the highest annual total since 2007.

Frontier also is ending service to Albany N.Y. and Huntsville Ala. next month citing low demand. However the carrier is expanding service in November at major airports in Atlanta and Phoenix and began construction last month on a 14-gate expansion at Denver International Airport that is scheduled for completion in mid-2024. Barry Biffle Frontier’s CEO told Reuters recently the carrier plans to expand its seat capacity by 10% to 20% a year through 2024.

Mike Boyd an Evergreen-based airline industry consultant said Frontier’s departure is no surprise as the airline is “probably one of the most flexible out there. If their service works they stay; if it doesn’t they leave and there are no hard feelings.”

Boyd said the entire airline industry is reducing seat capacity in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year amid forecasts of a national recession. Budget carriers like Frontier that depend mostly on leisure travelers are expected to be hit especially hard by a downturn he said.

He forecasts that passenger numbers in Colorado Springs could be down as much as 15% from last year which he said has “nothing to do with Colorado Springs and everything to do with the economy.”"

Union organizing has shifted into high gear. But despite successful organizing drives at such corporate powerhouses as Starbucks Amazon and Apple it’s still an uphill climb for unions seeking to sign up new members.

In recent history those upstart union wins are very much the exception rather than the rule and American labor laws remain stacked in employers’ favor.

There were 826 union elections from January through July of this year up 45% from the number held in the same period of 2021 according to a CNN analysis of data from the National Labor Relations Board which oversees organizing votes at most US businesses. And the 70% success rate by unions in those votes is far better than the 42% success rate in the first seven months of 2021.

But there were only 41000 potential union members eligible to vote in the 2022 elections. Even if the unions had won all those votes — NLRB data don’t break down how many workers worked at each company holding a vote — it would be a drop in the bucket among the estimated 105 million workers at US businesses who don’t belong to a union according to Labor Department statistics.

Starbucks union is key to organizing surge

The campaign by the grassroots Starbucks Workers United is a big part of the reason for the surge in organizing.

There have been votes conducted at nearly 300 Starbucks stores so far this year and while some results have yet to be determined the union has won at about 200 stores where the results have been certified or 85% of those votes.

There have been other high-profile victories. In April an Amazon distribution center in Staten Island New York became the first location in the company’s history to vote for a union. In another historic first workers at an Apple store in Maryland voted to form a union in June. And just last month workers at a Chipolte in Michigan opted to form a union with the Teamsters.

Many more votes are pending including at another Apple Store in Oklahoma City and another Amazon facility in suburban Albany New York. Elections are set at dozens more Starbucks stores.

But those corporate giants aren’t taking the union efforts lying down. In some instances the companies have shut down the location rather than deal with the organizing effort.

That happened at a Chipotle in Maine and a number of Starbucks locations. The companies insist the decisions were not retaliatory.

Chipolte said it couldn’t find the employees it needed to keep the Maine store open and Starbucks said its store closings were part of a broader plan to trim stores nationwide for safety issues.

The union said last month that eight of 19 stores slated for closings have either voted for the union filed for a vote or started to organize. And there is little in labor law that stops a company from doing that.

Few penalties for anti-union actions

“Employers have the upper hand” said Todd Vachon a professor of labor relations at Rutgers University. “It’s very hard to prove that’s the reason they closed. And the penalties are not even a slap on the wrist it’s the wagging of a finger.”

Companies also have little to fear in firing employees who are involved in organizing efforts labor experts say.

At most they’ll have to pay backpay plus some modest interest to the employee if the NLRB convinces a judge the company is guilty of misconduct. The amount the company owes can be reduced by whatever money that employee has earned elsewhere while waiting to have their case heard.

“The penalties are remarkably low” said Alexander Colvin dean of the school of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University.

In Memphis in February Starbucks fired seven employees including five of the six members of the union organizing committee. The employees and NLRB say the grounds given for the firing were violating company rules in assisting a local television news report about the organizing effort.

It took six months for the NLRB to win a federal court’s ruling that the employees had been fired for their union activity. Starbucks has denied any wrongdoing and is appealing the case which has stopped any of the workers from returning to their jobs.

“I was initially shocked when I heard of the first firing” said Nabretta Hardin 23 a barista who had been at the Memphis store since December 2020 and was among the seven who were fired. “I was actually the last to get fired so I was prepared. I was initially kind of sad and angry. I’m a great worker. I’ve never had trouble with management never caused any trouble never been written up.”

Hardin now works at a locally owned coffee shop she said treats her better than Starbucks did. She said she’s not surprised that Starbucks continues to appeal the case.

“They know they clearly lost the case but they’re dragging it out” she said. “It’s a slap on the wrist to a company the size of Starbucks.”

The union won the vote at the Memphis in June. But no other store in the city has filed to hold an election. Hardin thinks the impact of the firing on the union movement there was mixed.

“I felt when we got fired it would put a damper on the campaign” she said. “But it motivated some other people to fight harder to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

Overall the NLRB has filed more than 19 unfair labor practice complaints covering 81 cases filed by Starbucks Workers United. It is processing hundreds more.

Starbucks has said in its own filing that the labor board is working in concert with the union to support the organizing effort a charge the NLRB denies. It is similar to complaints that have been made by Amazon in regards to the vote it lost on Staten Island although this week it lost a first round in that case as a separate office of NLRB rejected all of its arguments and recommended certifying the union victory there.

Negotiation contracts next big challenge

So far Starbucks has not negotiated a single contract with any of the stores that voted to unionize. It typically takes more than a year to win the first contract after a successful union vote. There is virtually no penalty for a employer who does not reach a contract with the union said Cornell’s Colvin.

“That’s the next big question — can they win contracts?” he said. “If you don’t start getting contracts you won’t be able maintain the momentum.”

The AFL-CIO the largest union federation in the United States has been pushing for a change in labor law to put some teeth in the penalties that the NLRB can seek against management and require arbitration if a newly organized company refuses to negotiate with the union. But given the current political situation in Washington with Republicans unified in opposition there seems little chance of the AFL-CIO being able to pass its top priority in the near term without getting rid of the filibuster that requires 60 votes to get anything through the Senate.

“We’re not saying this is going to be easy” said Fred Redmond secretary treasurer of the labor federation. “We’re not giving up on it … It’s a piece of legislation that basically levels the playing field so workers don’t have to face retribution and abuse.”

Unions more popular

Unions have become more popular with the general public especially among younger workers like Hardin. A poll out last week from Gallup showed 71% of Americans now approve of unions the highest approval rate since 1965.

But when non-union workers were asked to rank how interested they were in joining a union enthusiasm was low. On scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being extremely interested and 1 being not at all interested only 20% answered 5 or 4. Nearly two-thirds gave 1 or 2.

That reluctance plus the weak state of penalties available against employers is a major reason why union membership has been slipping steadily for decades.

Labor Department data show only 6.1% of private sector employees are union members down from 16.8% in 1983. And while union representation is still common in some sectors such as airlines manufacturing and health care it’s much lower in the retail sector which is one of the segment of the US economy responsible for the greatest number of jobs. Only 4.4% of 14 million retail workers are union members.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjIvc2VwLzA1L3N0YXJidWNrcy1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS1jb21wYW55LXVuaW9uLWZpcmluZ3PSAWFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIyL3NlcC8wNS9zdGFyYnVja3MtcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtY29tcGFueS11bmlvbi1maXJpbmdz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You might think Starbucks is a ‘progressive’ company. You’d be wrong,"Corporate hypocrisy is as old as corporations themselves. But there are levels. It is important to recognize astounding achievements in business insincerity. So let us send a note of congratulations today to Starbucks: rarely in modern history have we witnessed a company that so exquisitely combines a cultivated image as a caring progressive employer with the well-documented large-scale behavior of a gangster who expects to rule employees through bullying and fear.

The $100bn coffee-and-flavored-syrup chain meticulously refers to its employees as “partners”. What does it mean to be a partner to someone? Reasonable people might say that a partnership is a relationship in which you treat the other person as an equal zealously uphold their basic rights and deal with them in all cases as fully formed human beings deserving of respect. Luckily for Starbucks they’ve had a great chance to exhibit these values over the past year as thousands of employees at more than 230 of their stores across the country have voted to unionize. The historic union wave has offered the company an unprecedented opportunity to respect their “partners’” right to organize; to listen to their concerns and requests for change; and to bargain contracts with them in good faith as partners of course should.

To say that Starbucks has failed to live up to their progressive reputation would be far too polite. It’s more like the union is Scooby-Doo and they have yanked off the company’s pleasant mask to reveal Tony Soprano lurking underneath.

This week the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said that Starbucks had illegally withheld raises and other benefits from its unionized workers. This is one of the oldest pseudo-friendly union busting tactics in the book – a company in the midst of a union campaign will hand out goodies to its non-union employees and then shrug theatrically and say: “Gee we’re not allowed to give these things to the union people!” (which as the NLRB has affirmed is a lie).

And that giant illegal ripoff is not even the worst part. The union Starbucks Workers United says that the company has fired more than 85 workers for organizing. The company has begun permanently closing stores that recently unionized or were in the process of doing so. The NLRB still has hundreds of charges of illegal labor practices against Starbucks that it has yet to rule on. There were so many GoFundMe campaigns floating around for fired Starbucks workers that the union finally had to set up a national Solidarity Fund to try to help them all. In the midst of all of this brash intimidation Starbucks has complained that the NLRB has unfairly favored the union which is akin to a bank robber complaining that the police are unfairly favoring the bank.

What accounts for the hubris of a company that so boldly risks its own reputation to flout labor law and treat its “partners” like so many automatons who must be whipped back into submission? I’m no psychoanalyst but I imagine that it flows from the same source as the hubris that made the billionaire Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz imagine that he could get elected president as an independent. It seems that none of Schultz’s sycophants were brave enough to tell him up front that he is perhaps the single worst presidential candidate you could ever imagine: Conservatives hate him because he pretends to be progressive; progressives hate him because he is in fact a cutthroat billionaire businessman who slathers himself in symbolic liberalism to ward off accurate criticism; and his own employees hate him because he treats their request for labor rights like an act of war.

Schultz who returned to Starbucks as CEO this year for the express purpose of fumbling the company’s response to unionization seems to imagine himself as some sort of kindly Stewart Brand figure who will redeem capitalism but acts in practice like just another irate union-buster – Andrew Carnegie with an espresso machine. (A monstrous bit of Democratic party trivia: Hillary Clinton reportedly considered Schultz as labor secretary in her presidential administration something that the next reporter to interview Clinton should absolutely ask her about.)

It may be that the very idea of a “progressive corporation” is given the realities of American capitalism an oxymoron. But anyone who has ever held a job understands what a good employer is. It is someone who treats workers as humans. When you get right down to it the demands of the many Starbucks workers who have unionized are downright modest. They have asked the company to sign a pledge to simply allow workers to choose to organize “without fear of reprisal”. The company has not only refused to sign but has dedicated itself to instilling fear of reprisal in the hearts of every single employee. That is not how a good boss treats his workers. That is not how a genuine progressive treats anyone. And it is certainly not how you would treat a “partner”.

In Boston recently I stopped by a unionized Starbucks store where workers have been on strike for more than a month. Through scorching days and lonely nights these young workers who could have spent the time doing anything more fun have maintained a 24/7 picket line. That is not something people do if they do not care – about their co-workers about their rights and about the company itself. Schultz who sits in his $30m mansion and sends out messages exhorting his employees to show “collective courage” has not been there. He should pay it a visit. I bet they could teach him a lot about what real progressive values look like.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2J1ZmZhbG9uZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9sb2NhbC93aHktYnVmZmFsby13YXMtdGhlLXBsYWNlLXRvLXVuaW9uaXplLXN0YXJidWNrcy9hcnRpY2xlX2JlNmMzYTY2LTFmZjgtMTFlZC1iZmRjLWNiOWQ0MWFkNGRjZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Buffalo was the place to unionize Starbucks,"The seed for the Starbucks unionizing effort was planted at Spot Coffee.

It was nurtured by activists like Jaz Brisack – who took a break between the successful effort to organize Spot workers in 2019 and starting a job at Starbucks for a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford University.

Starbucks unionization effort grows since its start by the 'brave baristas in Buffalo' Starbucks union organizers from Buffalo met virtually Wednesday with their friends in Congress: the House Labor Caucus. And afterward they spoke of the growing unionization effort now as every bit of a challenge as it has been from the beginning.

And it took root during the pandemic which emboldened front-line workers especially in low-paying positions who stayed on the job while office workers toiled from home.

Now nine months after the first Buffalo Starbucks stores voted to unionize the local organizing effort has turned into a nationwide push that has led to more than 200 Starbucks locations voting to join Starbucks Workers United.

How it started – and why it succeeded – has a lot to do with the Buffalo Niagara region itself and its history as a union town. It has a lot to do with a dedicated cadre of Starbucks union activists who used their Spot Coffee experience to mount a more daunting organizing effort with a much bigger target. And it has a lot to do with the new feelings of empowerment that front-line workers developed during the pandemic.

Starbucks workers in Buffalo vote to join union Workers at a Starbucks store in Buffalo voted to join a union making it the first company-owned store in the United States to organize.

What makes the union campaign at Starbucks so unusual is that fast-food chains are notoriously difficult to organize. Workers come and go so quickly it is difficult to build a core of committed union activists. But leaders at Workers United of Upstate New York would soon find that Starbucks’ progressive reputation draws progressive workers – those with a keen sense of social justice and politics that lean pro-worker and pro-union.

Overcoming obstacles

Despite the industry's high turnover some Buffalo Starbucks organizers had a decade or more of tenure which helped.

Even more important workers had a familiarity with unions. Though union membership has slipped here as it has elsewhere Buffalo has a strong history as a union town. Many Starbucks workers have family members in unions but even those who don’t still have an appreciation for what unions are how they work and what they mean.

It is a far cry from what Amazon organizers faced as they tried to unionize in Alabama – a right-to-work state with no labor history and a strong anti-union bent. Union membership in Alabama is half the national average.

What to watch for next after Starbucks union election in Buffalo In the months and years ahead the unionized workers will try to secure their first contract. Their success – or failure – could influence whether more Starbucks stores across the country could try to become unionized.

It is the opposite in the Buffalo Niagara region. While just one of every nine workers across the country belongs to a union organized labor has a much stronger foothold in the Buffalo Niagara region where more than one of every five workers is a union member.

Starbucks pulled out all the stops in Buffalo and fought the union hard. It was crucial to the union’s cause that Workers United was funded well enough to fight Starbucks’ court challenges at every turn.

The union also benefited when some of Starbucks’ anti-union tactics began to backfire – most spectacularly when CEO Howard Schultz compared himself to Holocaust victims while addressing Buffalo workers.

""I knew the campaign would take off naturally because conditions were explosive"" said Richard Bensinger senior adviser to the Starbucks Workers United campaign and the former organizing director for the AFL-CIO.

Starting at Spot

Starbucks aims to delay union vote as organizers target more stores Workers United which is seeking to organize workers at three stores is preparing to announce its campaign has ""expanded to even more stores.""

A big first step happened at Spot Coffee – a smaller chain than Starbucks that put up a smaller fight and whose unionization fortified Starbucks workers’ resolve.

It started with Gary Bonadonna Jr. at Workers United Upstate New York. He believed the time was getting ripe to organize restaurant workers unhappy with wages and working conditions. And he had an idea for how to take a different strategic tack to organize them.

""We chose to have a geographical organizing model for this segment of the economy "" said Bonadonna manager and international vice president of Workers United.

The focus started on cafes but Starbucks was never the original goal. Neither was Buffalo. The plans were to stay in Rochester where Workers United has its headquarters.

""I thought Buffalo was too big"" Bensinger said.

Union expands effort to organize Starbucks stores The union on Tuesday said it was filing petitions with the National Labor Relations Board to conduct votes at Starbucks stores at 4770 Transit Road in Depew 3186 Sheridan Drive in Amherst and 1775 Walden Ave. in Cheektowaga.

But Buffalo baristas caught wind of the union’s victories with smaller Rochester cafes and began contacting Workers United.

""Finally we said 'If they want a union let's help them get a union'"" Bensinger said.

The organizer on the Spot campaign was Brizack a University of Mississippi graduate who had been mentored by Bensinger. The two had worked to (unsuccessfully) organize a Nissan factory in Mississippi and she followed him to New York in 2019 to work with Workers United.

The Spot unionization efforts began acrimoniously but management became more amiable and the union ultimately prevailed. The tipping point came when Sen. Tim Kennedy called for a boycott which many Spot customers heeded.

During the Spot boycott Bensinger became a regular at the Genesee Street Starbucks across from the airport and got to know Starbucks worker Lexi Rizzo. She had been following Spot’s efforts and was adamant about trying to organize Starbucks. She eventually became an organizer.

When Spot unionized the headlines encouraged other Starbucks workers who began calling Workers United and expressing interest in forming a union of their own.

“In Spot we had an example of a good company and successful wage negotiations” Bensinger said. “Spot loomed large.""

In 2020 while on the Workers United payroll Brisack took a barista job at the Elmwood Avenue location. There she found workers empowered by Spot's unionizing move.

“Not only did I know that this was possible and have a framework of how to do it but my coworkers could believe that it was possible” Brisack said.

The movement had energized Starbucks workers who felt overworked understaffed and fed up. Morale was low across the Buffalo district and pleas to the company hadn't helped.

""We fill out these surveys that say the company cares but then nothing changes week after week"" said Will Westlake a barista at the store on Camp Road in Hamburg.

Michael Sanabria said he was ""at the end of my own rope"" before the union talks started. He had dropped down from supervisor to barista and was preparing to quit when someone invited him to an informational meeting about organizing.

""I was fed up with the direction the company was going and losing hope because calls to the company were falling on deaf ears"" he said. ""The meeting reignited my own hope.""

Combining experienced union organizers with such fired up workers was like setting a match to black powder.

""It was a tinder box"" Bensinger said.

Generation Z makes up the bulk of Starbucks organizers in Buffalo and it is known for having a progressive mindset and a tendency toward social action.

“This generation is every organizer’s dream” he said.

It also likely helped that most workers were familiar with unions and how they work. Organizers didn’t have to fight the kind of anti-union stigma they might have encountered in right-to-work states. Unions have had a strong presence in Buffalo going all the way back to Bethlehem Steel in the 1940s. It gave Workers United a foothold it might not have had elsewhere.

""When you are a union member or you live in a household with union members you generally know the benefits of union membership"" said Cathy Creighton director of Cornell University's School of Industrial Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab.

That was true for Casey Moore a worker and organizer at the Williamsville Starbucks who saw the benefits that union membership brought her dad. As a longtime private school teacher Moore said he didn't enjoy worker protections or job security.

""When he moved into public schools and started being represented by the teacher's union it made a huge difference"" she said.

Workers said they watched their parents and grandparents build nice middle-class lives buy homes and retire with pensions but have faced roadblocks trying to do the same. Many have linked their troubles to their lack of representation at work.

""That has played a major part"" said Sanabria who works at the Transit Commons Starbucks. ""I don't know anybody who can buy a house. And what's the concept of retirement? Everyone I know expects to work until they die.""

Add to that the Covid-19 pandemic. Already understaffed stores began operating on skeleton crews handling hundreds of customers a day in close quarters as the virus raged.

Meanwhile the company raked in record-breaking profits quarter after quarter. The company discontinued a $3 per hour pay bonus it had given workers to keep doors open during the pandemic after three months.

But it takes more than worker passion to fuel a successful union campaign. It takes significant resources and a union willing to use them – something not all Starbucks organizers have had in the past.

“We had the infrastructure a union that could take this on behind us” Brisack said. ”Just the sheer amount of legal battles we're having to fight and the ability to scale up to a national campaign made it imperative that we had resources to be able to do all of that.”

Starbucks has hired law firm Littler Mendelson to challenge the union in court and though Bonadonna declined to give a figure legal costs have been “significant” he said.

Starbucks workers win right to hold store-by-store unionization votes If the votes are successful as the workers predict the stores would become the first union Starbucks shops in the nation.

Workers United also won an important victory when the National Labor Relations Board decided it could hold union votes on a store-by-store basis rather than requiring the entire district to vote at once as Starbucks had requested. That meant workers could focus on winning over and retaining a few dozen workers at the first three stores as opposed to hundreds in the Buffalo Niagara market.

Still even holding onto a handful of workers is not easy in an industry with such high turnover. And companies will often delay actions in hopes that workers will quit before a vote is secured or that the movement will lose steam simply because of the transitory nature of its workers.

Starbucks pulled out all the stops – bringing dozens of corporate executives to Buffalo to persuade workers not to join the union. The company's billionaire CEO Howard Schultz came to personally appeal to workers and president Rossann Williams camped out for months.

The company transferred workers among stores in an effort the union claims to dilute support for the organizing effort. Starbucks also closed one organizing store and turned it into a training center.

But Starbucks' campaign backfired workers said. That was especially the case when Schultz told workers his decision to offer health care was similar to the generosity of Holocaust prisoners sharing tattered blankets during the war.

Former Starbucks CEO speaks to Buffalo-area workers amid union push Howard Schultz's visit comes just days before workers at three area Starbucks locations will begin voting in a union election.

""I think that was a turning point for a lot of people"" Brisack said. ""It was really the first time we'd heard from Howard directly and he was so out of touch that a lot of people became pro union listening to that.""

And for those on the verge of quitting the hope of forming a union gave workers the will to hang on Brisack said.

In the end organizers were successful and the Starbucks cafe on Elmwood Avenue became the first corporate-owned store to unionize. A flurry of union votes has followed with a total of eight unions forming at Starbucks in Buffalo and more than 200 unions succeeding around the country – even in less progressive states such as Tennessee Georgia and Missouri.

That snowball effect is exactly what companies fear and why Starbucks pulled out all the stops to block efforts in Buffalo Creighton said.

“Success is contagious. That is why companies work very hard to nip in the bud organizing efforts. Once employees see successful organizing efforts they feel empowered to try their hand at it also” she said.

Learning from Buffalo

Buffalo is still leading the charge – empowering unions in other states not just by being the first Starbucks to take the plunge and show it could be done but by holding training sessions for other Starbucks workers via zoom and sharing what they’ve learned so the movement can continue to grow.

Bensinger who founded a training institute for organizing workers has held workshops showing Buffalo workers how to train other interested organizers and handle the deluge of requests that came through for help since the union's first successful vote in December.

""We've gotten so many requests"" Bensinger said. ""And these workers are incredible."""

State Street Apartments includes the conversion of a vacant warehouse into 46 affordable homes including 14 with supportive services.

""With this new development we are helping to secure Olean's future with 46 safe affordable homes for New York families"" Governor Hochul said. ""New Yorkers deserve quality housing options in their own communities and thanks to our $25 billion housing plan we are making transformative investments to build and preserve affordable housing statewide.""

State Street Apartments is part of Governor Hochul's plan to make housing across New York State more affordable equitable and stable. In the FY 2023 State Budget the Governor introduced and successfully secured a new $25 billion five-year comprehensive housing plan that will increase housing supply by creating or preserving 100000 affordable homes across New York including 10000 with support services for vulnerable populations plus the electrification of an additional 50000 homes.

The development involves the gut rehabilitation of a 64000 square foot vacant warehouse located on East State Street. The design will maintain the current layout of the building except for the demolition of 10000 square feet of interior warehouse floor area to provide residents an interior courtyard overlooking Olean Creek/Alleghany River.

All 46 apartments will be affordable to households earning at or below 50 percent of the Area Median Income. Fourteen apartments will be reserved for households in need of supportive services. Rental subsidies and services for these units will be funded through the Empire State Supportive Housing Initiative and administered by the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. The services provider is Cattaraugus Community Action.

Five of the apartments will be fully accessible fully adapted units for persons with mobility impairment and two of the apartments will be equipped for persons with hearing and/or visual impairment.

The building will include free Wi-Fi for all residents with 24/7 IT management. Additional residential amenities will include a community room with kitchen a computer lab fitness center laundry room on each floor lobbies/communal seating areas as well as offices for property management and supportive service staff and maintenance storage.

The building's green design is expected to meet the requirements of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority's New Construction Program and LEED version 4. Energy efficient measures include the installation of all-new energy efficient mechanical electrical and plumbing systems; new energy efficient doors and windows for improved insulation; low- or no-VOC paint adhesives and sealants; Energy Star rated or equivalent windows and appliances equipment lighting and fixtures and Energy Star rated central heat and hot water.

Planned improvements to 2.4-acre parcel will include the construction of a new and enlarged parking lot with four EV charging stations new site lighting landscaping benches and the installation of a new playground.

The developer is CDS Monarch Inc.

State financing for State Street Apartments includes Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits that will generate $9.4 million in equity a $3 million in subsidy from the New York State Homes and Community Renewal. OTDA is providing $3.5 million through the Homeless Housing Assistance Program and NYSERDA will provide approximately $46000 in support.

Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said ""Like many communities Olean has an urgent need for new affordable housing to support the city's standing as an employment and economic center in Western New York. State Street Apartments will help meet this need by converting an unused warehouse into 46 beautiful and sustainable affordable homes with life-enhancing amenities like free Wi-Fi and outdoor space. Thanks to Governor Hochul investments like this one are addressing the nationwide affordability crisis on behalf of New York's families. Congratulations to CDS Monarch for getting this development off the ground.""

Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance Commissioner Daniel W. Tietz said ""Homelessness continues to challenge communities across the state and Cattaraugus County residents will benefit from the additional supportive housing apartments included in this project. State Street Apartments will provide safe stable and affordable housing along with supportive services to help those who have experienced homelessness to stabilize their lives.""

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said ""Advancing affordable quality housing is one of Governor Hochul's most important priorities. Reimagining and revitalizing vacant buildings to be modern green housing is an important part of our housing and economic development needs for the State which is a winning combination. Not only will the State Street apartments be visually appealing but more importantly they will provide healthy safe and comfortable living spaces for individuals with special needs and low-to-moderate income families in the City of Olean.""

Senator Chuck Schumer said ""Every Western New York family deserves access to safe affordable housing and I am proud that the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that I fought hard to expand has supplied the millions needed to convert this vacant warehouse into dozens of affordable energy-efficient homes. I applaud Governor Hochul on this essential affordable housing push and will keep fighting to get every dollar of federal support needed to lay the foundation for a brighter and more equitable future in Western New York.""

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said ""Like so many other cities across our state and nation Olean is in desperate need of more affordable housing. I applaud Governor Hochul for taking decisive action to combat this shortage. These new apartments will help dozens of low-income families in the Olean area obtain secure housing and access critical social services. I'm proud to have advocated for the Public Housing Assistance funding that provided the resources for this project and I'll keep working to ensure that every family in New York has a place to call home.""

Senator George Borrello 57th Senate District said ""Every New Yorker should have a comfortable affordable and safe place to call home. However it is a goal that has been out of reach for many in our region because of a severe lack of affordable housing options and inventory. That is why this project is so exciting. State Street Apartments will help our community better meet its housing needs while giving many Olean families and residents quality rental housing and services at an affordable rate. When our neighbors have a safe place to call home they are better equipped to progress and pursue their potential. My thanks go out to the Governor Commissioner Visnauskas Commissioner Tietz developer CDS Monarch and all those who played a role in bringing this to fruition. Its impact on the area in the coming years will be incalculable.""

Assembly Member Joseph Giglio said ""The need for safe affordable housing is very high so this project is crucial for the community. It is wonderful to see a former warehouse being rehabilitated and used in a new way to create attractive modern and accessible apartments for individuals and families. I look forward to the completion of these apartments and the revitalization of the East State Street neighborhood.""

Olean Mayor William Aiello said ""CDS Housing took on the challenge of converting the former Market Basket warehouse into 46 affordable apartments and I want to offer my congratulations as the ground is broken on this construction project. The City of Olean Departments of Community Development and Code Enforcement as well as the Planning Board worked with CDS as the organization sought funding and environmental approvals; I appreciate their perseverance and dedication to this venture. Finally I would like to acknowledge all federal and state agencies involved in this process with special thanks to Connecting Communities in Action who will supply support services to residents when the housing is available.""

Andrew Sewnauth President & COO of CDS Life Transitions said ""The State Street Apartments project continues our growth in New York allowing us another opportunity to further our mission to provide safe and affordable housing in communities across the state. We are excited to offer high-quality independent living that provides individuals and families with modern necessities to succeed and live a quality life. All of us at CDS Monarch are grateful to state and local government officials for their continued support ensuring that all New York residents are able to live and thrive in their communities.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvZ3JvY2VyeS1zdG9yZS1tYXktc29vbi1iZS1jb21pbmctdG8tc2NoZW5lY3RhZHktcy1oYW1pbHRvbi1oaWxsLXZhbGUtbmVpZ2hib3Job29kcy9hcnRpY2xlX2M1MDhjNjM0LTVmNDAtNTMyYS1hN2E5LWRiOTU4ZTFlMTAxZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grocery store may soon be coming to Schenectady's Hamilton Hill Vale neighborhoods,Success!

The Illinois State Police will move its District 11 headquarters from Collinsville to East St. Louis according to Brendan Kelly director of the agency.

The new facility will be built next to the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Center which is located on Argonne Drive.

District 11 serves Bond Clinton Madison Monroe and St. Clair counties.

Kelly said in an interview with the BND that a main impetus for the decision to move is the current facility is too crowded for the district’s growing activities. District 11 has to share the Collinsville facility with the Illinois Department of Transportation and other state agencies. The Collinsville location has been District 11’s home since 1987.

As part of Gov. J. B. Pritzker’s Rebuild Illinois Capital Plan $55 million has been allocated to the Illinois State Police for a new metro-east facility that will solely be dedicated to the work of the police agency. Funds from the Rebuild Illinois program signed into law in 2019 are intended to address infrastructure needs across the state.

“If you can reduce crime that makes it more attractive for investment in a community that’s showing an investment in public safety so it has a cumulative effect that can build over time to really improve (the) community” Kelly said. “All these things are coming together at once. The state police are honored to be a part of this broader effort and I think the partnership and the positive relationship that we have with stakeholders like JJK (Jackie Joyner-Kersee Center) will also be a benefit and (with) the access that the location will have for the entire region public safety will also be a benefit.”

“We’ll have our criminal investigation headquartered there patrol special operations like SWAT may have some space there and our communications. This will be an investment not just in public safety but an investment in the entire region.”

Derik Holtmann / Belleville News-Democrat Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly speaks about the partnership between East St. Louis and Illinois State Police to combat gun violence in the city.

Pritzker made a formal announcement about the headquarters move and the release of initial funding at a press conference in East St. Louis on Tuesday.

“Today we take a significant step forward in ensuring the safety and opportunity of Metro East reflects what its residents deserve – what all of Illinois deserves: a community where all our families can thrive” Pritzker said in an statement from his office. “This state-of-the-art facility will take a holistic approach to violent crime reduction making the community safer and establishing an anchor for residential and business investment.”

The new facility will feature two buildings: a headquarters that’s about 62500 square feet and a roughly 21000 square-foot warehouse. Kelly said it would take at least three years to complete the project.

“The initial funds will go into the design and architecture and engineering process” Kelly told the BND. “As part of that process we’ll be getting the various needs and perspectives of our investigators our troopers etc but also reaching out to the community to make sure our presence there in terms of how the building is designed will contribute to an overall positive presence so we’ll be including community stakeholders as that design process moves forward.”

Kelly said public forums will be held to involve the community in the design process for the new headquarters.

“It can take several years to collect that information and design a building and put it out for bid through the capital development board” he said. “This is a multi-year several year process but the most important step is getting the location and moving forward with the design.”

Plans to prioritize community engagement

The land that will be the new home for the Illinois State Police District 11 was donated to the agency by Lansdowne Up a new East St. Louis nonprofit that aims to revitalize the community. Earlier this year the faith-based organization announced plans to develop a 20-home subdivision at the intersection of 25th Street and Gross Avenue—a two-minute drive from where the Illinois State Police District 11 headquarters will be.

“We’re looking at luring people back to East St. Louis giving them reasons to come back” Kevin Green director of administration for Lansdowne Up said in March about the nonprofit’s goal for the community.

Director Kelly commends the group’s passion for uplifting the city. He said its donation of land which was submitted in 2020 met all the requirements that the agency was looking for in a new location. The Illinois State Police selected the property for the new headquarters in June of 2020.

“We were looking for a minimum of four acres” Kelly said. “It needed to be within two miles of the interstate system and needed to be within walking distance of public transportation. It would have to accomodate the square footage we were looking for including parking. It needed the right environmental assessments and proper zoning and utilities etc… JJK is right there on MetroLink.”

“Obviously the interstate is our main area of focus for the Illinois State Police but we also want to be able to access the interstate to get around the region to be able to respond to public safety emergencies around the region and this location right on I-64 connects with(Interstates) 55 255 70 64 is an ideal location next to public transportation and also having a very positive impact on the overall community there.”

Bridging the gap?

Kelly cited the agency’s growing relationship with East St. Louis as another reason why the state agency chose the location. The Illinois State Police launched its Public Safety Enforcement Group (PSEG) in 2020 to help the East St. Louis Police Department handle investigations for homicides non-fatal shootings aggravated assault sexual assault robbery and other violent crimes in the city. In December the group touted a 55% clearance rate for homicides last year.

Derik Holtmann / St. Louis Public Radio East St. Louis Police Chief Kendall Perry talks about the cooperative effort with the East St. Louis police department and the Public Safety Enforcement Group.

The agency also assists East St. Louis School District 189’s Wraparound Wellness Center by offering trauma-informed resources to children who’ve experienced violent crimes in the area. Kelly perceives the new headquarters as a necessary extension of the close connection the agency already has with the city and its residents. He said the plans follow the agency’s statewide model in having a community-based approach in policing.

“The partnership with District 189 the partnership that we have with various faith-based organizations is only bound to grow stronger over this period and this model which is a holistic model definitely has its benefits” Kelly said. “That creates more community engagement and reinforces the trust between law enforcement and the people that need protecting to create a safe space for other things to grow.”

Attempting to build trust between police and predominantly Black communities in the United States like East St. Louis is a challenge especially given the history of police brutality against Black people.

In East St. Louis two allegations of police brutality surfaced in 2022. This spring two Black men filed complaints alleging that an East St. Louis police officer beat them during a March arrest. One of them said in a complaint that he was beaten so badly that he needed stitches on his eyebrow and nose. In June East St. Louis Police Department said an outside agency is investigating a 2019 video that showed an officer entering an East St Louis jail cell and apparently spraying a substance on a teen who was lying down.

Contributed Jaylen Lacey 22 filed a complaint against the East St. Louis Police Department for an alleged beating against him that happened on March 14.

An increased police presence in the city doesn’t guarantee that those circumstances won’t happen. However Kelly said that the community wanting that presence is proof of the trust that people have in the agency to fairly serve East St. Louis residents.

“The way the Illinois State Police approaches policing (is that) we have a high degree of integrity and that I think that’s why the local community is not just welcoming but wants us there more to help create the space for safety for them to build new neighborhoods to build churches and other places of worship and to build businesses in a location (that) by all counts should be an ideal location for economic activity but it is the public safety issues that have made it more challenging” Kelly said. “This is just a piece of the puzzle for the community and we’re very honored to be part of that for them.”"

Over the past 20 years the FTSE 100 medical devices group has regularly been tipped as a takeover target with the list of rumoured trade suitors including Johnson & Johnson Biomet Zimmer & Stryker and Medtronic.

However some analysts reckon that this time the speculation could be a little firmer than previously and with the stock trading well below historic multiples private equity could be interested. With most of Smith & Nephew’s business conducted in dollars and euros the falling pound also serves to make the company look cheap.

The shares hit a high of £19.90 in February 2019 but after a tough pandemic have almost halved in value. Jack Reynolds-Clark an analyst at RBC said",,,,,,

Many baby boomers do.

But for retailers having an online strategy isn’t enough — especially if it’s an outdated one and only designed for one generation.

A new generation of shoppers Gen Z are bending online shopping to their will. Their preferences and values are making it more convenient and spontaneous…more interwoven with social media…and in some cases more like a game.

Companies that don’t get their arms around this trend will find it harder and harder to capture these younger shoppers who have more than $360 billion in disposable income more than double the amount from three years ago. There are already 7.3 million Gen Z workers in the U.S. More will follow.

Consider according to a recently Generational Insights poll sponsored by Synchrony:

47% of Gen Z have made a purchase through Instagram

Gen Z believes the buying experience is as important as the product itself

Gen Z enjoys earning rewards/points that can be used for discounts and savings

At the same time just to complicate things further for retailers Gen Z actually likes to shop in physical retail stores according to the study.

Make no mistake this is a treacherous environment for retailers which must make complex and difficult decisions about where to invest and divest how to train employees which technologies to employ and so on.

Three suggestions:

Adapt to where and how Gen Z wants to shop. Visiting a website choosing a product reviewing a “shopping cart” typing in credit card details etc. strikes Gen Z as cumbersome slow and old-fashioned. They want shopping to be fast and fun — less of a process. That’s why Synchrony partnered with payments startup Skipify which enables purchases instantly across email text social and other channels. This new way of shopping is a powerful retail trend toward simplifying speeding and improving the online shopping experience.

Give young shoppers options to pay for goods. The Generational Insights study indicates that while Gen Z still favors debit over credit their use of credit is on the rise — and they want to build a credit history. This is an excellent opportunity for retailers to give young shoppers financing options — including a store credit card an installment loan or a buy now pay later product.



Making paying more flexible can also include new contactless methods such as paying by phone or with “cashierless” technology that lets in-store customers simply pick up an item walk out with it and be charged automatically.

Making paying more flexible can also include new contactless methods such as paying by phone or with “cashierless” technology that lets in-store customers simply pick up an item walk out with it and be charged automatically. Customize physical stores to the omnichannel experience. The research shows that despite being digitally savvy younger generations prefer to shop in a store for most purchases. But an online presence is necessary as consumers typically research and review before purchasing. Building this kind of omnichannel experience revolves around a combination of data analytics and mobile devices. It is critical to provide consumers the right offer at the right time in the right location. With products like dApply Synchrony allows consumers to quickly apply for a financing product with a QR code and get approved within minutes.



Gen Z’s actions aren’t hard to understand — actually they make a lot of sense. The younger generation is bringing its digital savvy and expectations to all aspects of their lives — from work to recreation activities to shopping. And they represent a market segment that retailers can’t ignore. Merchants who break out of the old way of doing things will be perfectly positioned to profit for years to come.

SUNNYVALE Calif. Sept 6 2022 – Intrinsic ID the world’s leading provider of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) security IP today announced a renewed collaboration with Synopsys Inc. to provide pre-verified PUF and hardware secure module (HSM) security solutions that protect connected devices against advanced security threats. The Synopsys tRoot™ HSM IP now offers easy integration with Intrinsic ID QuiddiKey® hardware IP implementing SRAM PUF enabling designers with little security experience to quickly add system and data protection features to their SoC designs. Additionally Intrinsic ID CEO Pim Tuyls will be speaking about the collaboration at the Synopsys ARC Processor Summit on Sept 8 2022 in a talk entitled “Rooting Trust in Hardware with Invisible Keys from SRAM PUF Technology.”

Cyberattacks are on the rise: according to Check Point Research corporate cyberattacks spiked 50% in 2021 reinforcing the need for device-level security. An embedded HSM is one of the strongest ways to implement secure authentication trusted communication and data protection. Combining the HSM with PUF technology adds an additional layer of protection by generating secure cryptographic keys based on device-unique variations within the silicon of the chip itself. With the SRAM PUF from Intrinsic ID the root key is re-generated every time the chip is powered up and is only available (in volatile memory) when needed. This means the key is never present in persistent memory not even when the chip is powered down. Since the key is not stored on the device it is significantly harder for attackers to obtain substantially raising the level of security.

“Protecting highly sensitive data and valuable information in connected systems begins with establishing trust early in the design process” said John Koeter senior vice president of marketing and strategy for the Solutions Group at Synopsys. “The integration of Intrinsic ID’s SRAM PUF technology with the highly secure Synopsys tRoot HSM IP enables SoC designers to protect the device and its data at boot time runtime and during the communication with other devices or to the cloud.”

“The integration of Synopsys tRoot HSM and QuiddiKey technologies is the next logical step in our long-standing collaboration with Synopsys and will produce many benefits for our mutual customers through delivering more security and a faster time to market” said Pim Tuyls CEO of Intrinsic ID. “Synopsys has always been on the leading edge of ensuring security and by combining their highly secure module with Intrinsic ID’s PUF technology it is raising the bar for security even further to ensure the best solution for our mutual customers.”

The Synopsys tRoot HSM is a highly secure module with hardware root of trust designed to easily integrate into SoCs and provide a scalable solution in support of various security functions for booting up a system key management secure storage debug and updates. The Synopsys tRoot HSMs with Root of Trust provide designers with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that protects sensitive information and data processing within their SoCs and communication with external entities. The HSMs leverage scalable cryptographic accelerators and secure processors with resilience against physical attacks as well as unique code protection mechanisms that provide run-time tamper detection and response without the added cost of more dedicated secure memory.

QuiddiKey IP can be applied easily to almost any chip – from tiny microcontrollers to high-performance systems-on-chip to secure the products with device-unique cryptographic keys. QuiddiKey uses the inherently random start-up values of SRAM as a PUF which generates the entropy required in a strong hardware root of trust. QuiddiKey IP can be used with any foundry and any process-node technology and has been deployed and proven in hundreds of millions of devices certified by NIST EMVCo Visa CC EAL6+ PSA ioXt and governments across the globe.

About Intrinsic ID

Intrinsic ID is the world’s leading provider of security IP for embedded systems based on PUF technology. The technology provides an additional level of hardware security utilizing the inherent uniqueness in each and every silicon chip. The IP can be delivered in hardware or software and can be applied easily to almost any chip – from tiny microcontrollers to high-performance FPGAs – and at any stage of a product’s lifecycle. It is used as a hardware root of trust to protect sensitive military and government data and systems validate payment systems secure connectivity and authenticate sensors.

BELLEVUE Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Watch out Big Internet T-Mobile is turning the Northeast magenta! Today T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) announced it has expanded the footprint of its 5G Home Internet service across Connecticut Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania where more than three million households still have no access to home broadband. With this latest expansion more than 9 million homes throughout these states are now eligible for T-Mobile Home Internet.

Fast reliable home broadband has never been more important but for families across the country access to home broadband is still out of reach. In Connecticut alone more than 320000 households – approximately 23% of total homes across the state – and more than 100000 children lack high-speed internet. And in Pennsylvania more than 800000 residents lack access with more than 500000 of those living in rural areas. And it doesn’t stop there a 2021 study by BroadbandNow confirms that more than 42 million people nationwide do not have access to broadband. That’s a disaster. Luckily T-Mobile is here to help clean up the mess.

Today’s expansion reinforces the continued demand and need for T-Mobile Home Internet and follows recent announcements in California Texas the Southeast Midwest and South. During Q2 earnings T-Mobile announced that it now has more than 1.5 million Home Internet customers making it the fastest growing broadband provider for the third quarter in a row. Now more than 40 million households – a third of them in rural America – are eligible for 5G Home Internet. They’ll get broadband speeds that handle multiple devices at the same time for working streaming zooming online learning gaming and more!

What People Are Saying

“Here in Connecticut our administration has made expanding access to broadband internet a top priority because until we tackle our underserved broadband challenges in our urban suburban and rural areas we will not have equitable access for all and achieve the economic recovery that we need” said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. “As we continue our focus to ensure Connecticut residents are connected I am glad that we have partners like T-Mobile that are working to address this need as well.”

“Rochester is lucky to be one of 64 cities in the Northeast where T-Mobile is expanding their Home Internet service to thousands more households” said Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Bob Duffy. “We thank T-Mobile for their investment in our region which will help many more individuals and families work learn and stay remotely connected in today’s rapidly shifting world.”

“Expanding broadband in my district and throughout the commonwealth has always been a longtime priority of mine” said Senator Sal DiDomenico Assistant Majority Leader of the Massachusetts Senate. “I want to thank T-Mobile for their investment in our area. This will allow more of our communities access to reliable internet.”

“Millions of people across this country still have little to no choice when it comes to home broadband. That’s because traditional ISPs have continued to underserve customers year after year even as reliance on connectivity grows” said Mike Katz Chief Marketing Officer at T-Mobile. “So today we’re doubling down on our mission to bring connectivity to more people expanding Home Internet in states across the Northeast. As we’ve seen quarter after quarter people are desperate for a new option in home broadband. With 5G Home Internet we’re delivering just that.”

Steve Carlson from T-Mobile says “Today we rely on home internet for just about everything that’s important to us like work and school and connecting with family and friends. But the unfortunate reality is that access to affordable and reliable broadband is still a challenge for millions across the U.S. more than a million in New York as we just said and choice and competition are often limited or in some cases no choice at all and that’s where T-Mobile comes in. Last year T-Mobile launched T-Mobile 5G home internet which is now available to more than 40 million homes nationwide including nearly four million homes across New York.”

When asked how broadly available is T-Mobile home internet in Buffalo Steve says “It’s now available to more than 250000 households and it is super easy to sign up. You can get T-Mobile home internet for just $50 a month and if you are on our Magenta Max plan which is our most popular phone plan it’s just $30 a month and on top of that there are no extra taxes and fees no data caps no annual contract and installation is easy. We will ship you the router and you can set it up yourself in just 15 minutes.”

Is wireless home internet the same as broadband? Steve says “T-Mobile’s home internet uses the same great 5G network that our smartphones run on in areas where we have extra network capacity. It works just like any other broadband service but instead of connecting to a cable in your home it connects wirelessly through a gateway and that allows us to bring high-speed internet to outlying areas too.

Steve tells us that T-Mobile announced internet freedom which solves customer pain points that have been plaguing the broadband industry for decades. With internet freedom customers can try their network free for 15 days and if you want to break up with your current internet provider he says they will pay up to $500 in early termination fees and you can lock in your price with their price lock guarantee and you don’t have to be a T-Mobile wireless customer to sign up for home internet.

This latest expansion in coverage gives more than 9 million homes access to T-Mobile’s internet the company says. However as our review last year showed that doesn’t mean it’s going to be consistent everywhere. T-Mobile warns that even if your city is on the list (available below) it’s not ready to go everywhere yet. However some people may be eligible for 4G LTE service. Currently the service is $50 a month for AutoPay customers and $30 for families with Magenta MAX T-Mobile’s phone plan.

Launched in April 2021 the Home Internet service has been steadily expanding across the US.

On Tuesday the carrier filed a complaint in Texas's Eastern District Court accusing its rival of false advertising. T-Mobile’s recently launched “Verizon and AT&T Ban Senior Discounts” campaign is at the center of the lawsuit. The activation includes a website that claims “92 percent of seniors in the US can’t get a wireless discount from Verizon and AT&T because they don’t live in Florida.”

The campaign aims to draw attention to a promotion that dates back to John Legere’s tenure as CEO of T-Mobile. Since 2017 the carrier has offered Unlimited 55+ plans that give people 55 and older discounted access to its network. For instance the current base level package starts at $40 per month with autopay and includes “unlimited” talk text and smartphone data.

In early 2020 AT&T began piloting its own Unlimited 55+ plan. At the moment however it’s only available in Florida. “Until Verizon and AT&T offer senior discounts outside of Florida we’re helping their customers get access to the wireless discounts they deserve as part of our Carrier Callout” T-Mobile says.

AT&T contends T-Mobile’s campaign is “intentionally designed to deceive senior citizens.” The carrier says T-Mobile’s website includes claims that are “literally false.” Moreover it notes that “AT&T has not ‘banned’ seniors from getting discounted services outside the state of Florida.” The company points to a program it has had in place since March 2015. AT&T offers members of AARP a nonprofit organization that represents more than 38 million seniors in the US a $10 discount off its Unlimited Premium plan among other perks. That promotion is available in all 50 US states.

“T-Mobile’s claims are outright dishonest and completely false. It is not the first time they have spread misleading information” an AT&T spokesperson said. “AT&T offers wireless discounts to people of all ages including seniors in all 50 states. The only way to stop the un-truthful carrier is apparently in a court of law and that’s where we are.”

T-Mobile did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. AT&T is seeking damages and an injunction against the campaign. The Unlimited 55 promotion isn’t the first time T-Mobile has gotten in trouble for its advertising. In 2020 the carrier said it would stop claiming its 5G network was more reliable than that of its competitors after Verizon filed a complaint with National Advertising Review Board.

T-Mobile USA Inc. stores customer data including location information for up to 24 months it told the regulator. AT&T Mobility including its subsidiary Cricket Wireless stores locations and most other user data for 13 months but it stores some call records for up to five years it reported.

Verizon Wireless the nation’s largest carrier stores users’ personal data including locations for one year although it said its on-board vehicle diagnostic application stores it for up to five years. Mint Mobile LLC the prepaid budget virtual mobile provider stores data including location information for up to 18 months it said.

Not all carriers sell location data to third party marketing firms but those that do outlined unique processes that consumers have to navigate to opt out of authorizing their data to be sold sometimes with different rules applying to call record details and location data.

The carriers’ responses were “all over the map” according to Harold Feld senior vice president at Public Knowledge a Washington public interest group focused on digital privacy.

“The only ‘industry standard’ appears to be that there is no standard at all for how long carriers retain data how they protect it or how hard they make it for their customers to invoke their rights” Feld added.

Public Knowledge is urging the commission to pass strong data privacy regulations to protect so-called customer proprietary network information.

‘Mobile phones know a lot about us’

“Customer proprietary network information” as defined by Section 222 of a 1996 law (PL 104-104) includes any data that mobile carriers are required to safeguard such as numbers dialed call duration and perhaps most sensitive the locations the user visited while their device was pinging a cell tower.

“Our mobile phones know a lot about us” FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in an Aug. 25 statement. “That means carriers know who we are who we call and where we are at any given moment. This information and geolocation data is really sensitive. It’s a record of where we’ve been and who we are.”

“That’s why the FCC is taking steps to ensure this data is protected” she added.

Rosenworcel a Democrat appears poised to crack down on data policies for mobile carriers and follow through on her sharp dissent in a 2020 FCC decision to fine the four largest carriers at the time. She argued the commission’s collective $200 million fine against T-Mobile Sprint AT&T and Verizon for selling users’ data to third parties without their consent didn’t resolve the problems.

The then-Republican-controlled commission reduced the fine from a potential $40000 per day for the duration of the violation to $2500 per day. Rosenworcel wrote in dissent that the commission’s “bureaucratic math” aiming to ease the punishment was unwarranted.

With Rosenworcel now at the commission’s helm and a Democratic majority in sight if President Joe Biden’s controversial FCC pick Gigi Sohn is confirmed by the Senate the FCC is now more likely to tighten the rules around mobile carriers’ management and authority to sell consumer data.

Congress could beat them to it but only if it overcomes a dispute about the interaction of federal and state authority on privacy regulation.

The House is working on bipartisan legislation that would establish clearer standards for data privacy but its provisions may not satisfy the staunchest privacy advocates unless it clearly allows states like California the ability to be more strict according to some lawmakers.

A bill was approved 53-2 by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on July 20. It is sponsored by Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. D-N.J. and co-sponsored by ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers R-Wash. Leaders of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce Chair Jan Schakowsky D-Ill. and ranking member Gus Bilirakis R-Fla. are also backing it.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said Sept. 1 that lawmakers would need to work on the bill saying it doesn’t provide the same consumer protections as existing California law.

The House bill with more than 20 amendments adopted in committee may also not gain the approval of Senate Commerce Chair Maria Cantwell D-Wash. Cantwell and some progressive Democrats don’t want federal law to preempt states from passing stricter data privacy laws.

Republicans on the other hand are worried that a state-by-state patchwork of rules rather than a national standard could make compliance too onerous on businesses.

Partisan division means the bill faces a slim chance of passage in the evenly split Senate.

Provisions of the House legislation include ensuring a “clear and conspicuous easy-to-execute means” for customers to easily withdraw their consent to the sale of their personal data.

Carriers would be entirely banned from selling data related to minors under age 17 or using children’s information for any targeted marketing purposes.

The bill would also require the Federal Trade Commission to adopt regulations within two years that establish more specific data privacy safeguards that include certain minimum standards training obligations and requirements for written retention and corrective action plans. Carriers would have a duty under the law to mitigate “reasonably foreseeable risks or vulnerabilities.”

Reproductive privacy

Privacy concerns grew more urgent in the eyes of many after the Supreme Court overturned a constitutional right to abortion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case in June. For Democrats the ruling encouraged them to back stronger privacy protections amid fears that user locations and other data could be used to spy on individuals seeking abortion services in states that restrict it.

Many privacy advocates raised alarms in the wake of the Dobbs decision about the sensitive nature of personal data stored on menstrual-tracking applications used by millions of women.

Cantwell is among a dozen co-sponsors of a bill introduced after a draft of the Dobbs opinion leaked in May. The bill would prohibit organizations that collect information about individuals’ sexual or reproductive health from disclosing it to third parties unless doing so is essential for medical care.

The bill which includes a private right to sue would apply to a broad range of companies including mobile communications providers and technology companies that operate menstrual-tracking apps.

Even though Congress may be unable to agree on robust data privacy protection legislation right now the FCC “can and should do more” to protect consumers according to Public Knowledge’s Feld.

“Right now customers must negotiate a confusing maze of carrier practices and notifications” Feld said. “The FCC is more than an enforcer; it is a regulator. The FCC should set new rules of the road so that subscribers have the privacy we need and deserve.”"
TROW,T Rowe Price,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbnoubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL3Qtcm93ZS1wcmljZS1ncm93dGgtc3RvY2stMTEwMDExMDYwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,"If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds consider T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) as a possibility. PRGFX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy) which is based on nine forecasting factors like size cost and past performance.

History of Fund/Manager

PRGFX is a part of the T. Rowe Price family of funds a company based out of Baltimore MD. Since T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund made its debut in April of 1950 PRGFX has garnered more than $27.07 billion in assets. Joseph Fath is the fund's current manager and has held that role since January of 2014.

Performance

Obviously what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 10.42% and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 7.82% which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.

When looking at a fund's performance it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years PRGFX's standard deviation comes in at 23.37% compared to the category average of 16.82%. Looking at the past 5 years the fund's standard deviation is 20.62% compared to the category average of 15.1%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.

Risk Factors

Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.1 so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark which in this case is the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years the fund has a negative alpha of -2.77. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.

Holdings

Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund the focus is primarily on equities that are traded in the United States.

As of the last filing date the mutual fund has 98.26% of its assets in stocks which have an average market capitalization of $683.48 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:

Technology Retail Trade

With turnover at about 22.7% this fund makes fewer trades than the average comparable fund.

Expenses

Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees PRGFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.63% compared to the category average of 0.99%. PRGFX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.

While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2500 investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.

Bottom Line

Overall T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund ( PRGFX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance worse downside risk and lower fees this fund looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.

Described by the designers as a “bold re-imagination of the airport paradigm” the new terminal will increase the airport’s capacity by 50 million annual passengers.

KPF and Heatherwick were awarded the bid to design the terminal back in 2018 part of a larger project to deliver 100 additional aircraft stands a three-runway system and new cargo complexes. The airport was also the focus of international attention in 2019 with the unveiling of Moshe Safdie’s “Jewel Changi” addition featuring the world’s largest indoor waterfall.

The design of Terminal 5 adopts an “airport as a city” concept where each component is seen as an opportunity to create a neighborhood with its own character. The team also bills the terminal as an “engaging new district” of benefit to travelers and locals echoing Safdie’s move to combine natural and built elements within the airport.

“Our design for Terminal 5 is inspired by Singapore’s unique blend of nature and city” said KPF Design Principal Trent Tesch in a statement. “We are conscious of the international significance of this project and are focused on creating not only an iconic building that is identifiably Changi Airport but also a memorable and positive experience for travelers and the greater public.”

The scheme is expected to be completed by the mid-2030s.

News of the project comes soon after Heatherwick unveiled their latest completed project: a kinetic glasshouse in the English countryside that opens to mimic a petal. The firm has also recently completed work on Google’s Bay View HQ campus in California designed in collaboration with BIG. KPF meanwhile has recently broken ground on a new headquarters for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.

Other airport schemes recently seen in our editorial include an Automated People Mover at LAX a timber-rich expansion of Portland International by ZGF and a $4 billion terminal at LaGuardia.",,,,,,

The state of the Grand Theft Auto community at the moment is that they're hoping that a prospective UFO hunt in Grand Theft Auto Online originating from an Easter egg in the Definitive Edition of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas will lead to a Grand Theft Auto VI reveal in October. And inhale. With so little to go off from Take-Two Interactive you can see why this simple and sweet ""thank you"" commendation has fans in a spin.

Check out the differences between the PlayStation 5 version and the fan modded version of Grand Theft Auto V in this comparison below:

The official pages for Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are still active of course and this ""thank you"" letter is separate to those entries. Perhaps it's years upon years of Grand Theft Auto VI speculation that's liquified our brains but could this signify an imminent announcement from Rockstar Games regarding the next entry in the series. Alternatively the developer might be reminding us of the huge global effort from its employees that created one of the greatest games in the last ten years.

Rockstar Games recently put up a new post thanking the massive army of developers specialists and staffers who worked on one of the most popular and best-selling games of all time. With nearly 170 million shipments worldwide across three console generations GTA V is less of a game and more of a kind of mini franchise in of itself; the game has generated at least $7.68 billion since 2013 and much more when the full scope of GTA Online's microtransactions are included.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

That massive success came at a heavy investment of both manpower and funding. The Rockstar Games thank you post highlights just how many people it takes to make something like GTA V. By our count more than 5000 people worked on the game. We selected all the names and copied them into Excel to see how many columns there were and Excel clocked in 6820. Headers/job titles account for a sizable portion of these columns so keep that in mind.

""Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online represent the combined efforts of our global team over many years. We want to acknowledge and thank everyone who has contributed to these games from their original launch in 2013 all the way through to present day.""

We can't imagine how many people are working on Grand Theft Auto 6 but reports indicate the game will ship with a smaller singleplayer mode at launch and expand with new campaign content over time via online updates while also running GTA Online in parallel.

Reports also say that GTA 6 will take place in Miami and feature a female protagonist for the first time in the series. There are to be two playable characters--one male and one female--in a no-holds-barred modern day Bonnie and Clyde story of crime passion and chaos.

Neither Rockstar Games nor Take-Two Interactive have announced or confirmed any details about GTA 6 other than saying that yes the game is ""well under way"" in terms of development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZW50cmFja3IuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvaW5kaWEtaXMtYS1tb2JpbGUtZmlyc3QtZ2FtaW5nLW1hcmtldC1ub3ctZGV2ZWxvcGVycy1hcmUtbG9va2luZy1hYnJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India is a mobile-first gaming market. Now developers are looking abroad,"India’s mobile gaming market is big. Not just in comparison to PC and console gaming; it is big period. PUBG Mobile’s revamped avatar Battlegrounds Mobile India had 100 million registered users in India before it was mysteriously banned last month. The pandemic breakout hit Ludo King has over 500 million downloads.

Clearly the opportunity for small-screen gaming is big in India with both Indian and foreign studios showing increased interest in penetrating a market that is ripe for a classically ad-dominated business model. But game studios operating in India are turning to a more tantalizing prospect: developing mobile games in India for a global audience.

“70% of the employees that we have work on about ten to 15 games that are primarily for the global audience” Kishore Kichili the India country head of Take Two Interactive-owned Zynga told Entrackr in an interview. Zynga has a significant presence in India and recently released two games in collaboration with the Indian government to mark the 75th year of independence celebrations.

Even so Kichili stressed Zynga’s Bengaluru office was focused on starting game development from Indian talent that could be marketed globally.

Zynga isn’t the only one. Gametion the developer behind Ludo King said in a blog post that Indians weren’t alone in helping the company break download records. The game “not only attracted more native Indian players but also gathered an expanding player base in the American and European countries” Gametion said in a May blog post. While the studio doesn’t disclose a breakdown of downloads by countries it said that the game’s surprise success took it “to places where the Ludo game wasn’t even known.”

There’s a distinction to be made here between game studios that do outsourcing work in India and those that are actually creating and ideating new games from India. For instance developers like Electronic Arts and Rockstar Studios have a significant presence in India but they generally do not work on titles that are conceived and executed by Indian teams. These teams usually do manpower-intensive and time consuming work like quality control and handling development tasks that the main teams cannot handle.

But now studios seem to be warming up to building on this presence to release original content that is for lack of a better term made in India.

At least one developer leapt at the opportunity fairly early — Super Gaming a Pune-based startup released a game that found decent success abroad before ever becoming a known name in India. MaskGun a first person shooter game that Super Gaming developed was able to garner 42 million installations most of which came from international audiences until PUBG was first banned. The game got more than 62 million downloads as of this April.

The focus abroad makes sense — while developers can gain massive reach in India most users in India don’t spend on games meaning studios are limited to ad revenue from them Zynga’s Kichili pointed out. Meanwhile he added talent in India to develop these games is in good supply.

Support from the government has also started coming in slowly — the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting set up the Animation Visual Effects Gaming and Comics (AVGC) task force in April which has been holding discussions with game developers to create Indian stories for a global audience. Kichili is a part of that task force.

“It will be in our best interest to take those [Indian] concepts and build a game for a larger stage and maybe localize that for each part of the world” Kichili said.

From development decisions to plans for after the game launches here are the answers to some of the biggest questions posed to members of the development team.

NHL 23 launches on October 14 for Xbox Series X|S PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Thanks to MP1st for the transcription of the answers. There are a number of other questions answered on their website so check them out.

Top NHL 23 Questions

Q: Now with a year more of experience with the Frostbite engine what improved or new things have you been able to do with it?

Clement Kwong (Lead Producer): Year One was just about getting Frostbite and the big lift in visual quality and the tie that really brings the entire game. This year Year Two we want to be more focused and lean into what Frostbite is able to deliver in terms of engine. Really focus on creating the most immersive experience that we have ever seen. Everything from the presentation package to the crowd atmosphere to even things like the Stanley Cup celebration. All of the content creators were really excited about the immersion they were able to extend through from game to game.

Q: Will the camera shake for Away opponents when the crowd is loud?

Mike Inglehart: It’s a great idea we don’t have any camera shake that we have added this year. The crowd itself is going to play a massive part in the experience. I think it’s really going to affect the energy and emotion. It’s definitely something I will write down after this and take away as we go forward with the franchise. I think the crowd is a very good surprise that I think people are going to enjoy. I think we did a good job thrusting people into the arena taking you from the couch to that stadium seat. It is probably justified that the camera should shake given some of the reactions. But all in all I think it’s going to shake up the emotion and energy you feel and really make the game more compulsive and bring you back to those big moments that we crafted and taken a lot of pride in this year.

Q: Could you recap on the improvements being made to EASHL?

Mike Inglehart: For this year the real focus we had was the cross-platform matchmaking. We can always add new features to every mode every single year we spend on the game. I think it is important to take a step back and look at the foundation of the mode and what’s needed to set it up for the future. This feature in cross platform matchmaking was highly sought after for a long time and it was time to finally answer that bell and bring that forward. Without that we can’t make the progress we want to make. We’ve put all of our energy into that we want to have that there so people can have a better experience overall. That sets us up for the future so we can now invest more into the mode build it out add some more breath of depth but we needed to start with cross-platform matchmaking and finally bring that to the forefront within the mode.

Q: How will NHL 23 handle the Arizona Coyotes playing in an NCAA arena?

Mike Inglehart: We do have them in a smaller rink for NHL 23. It’s not the replica rink that they are playing in real life. We wanted to make sure we are staying as authentic as possible. They will be in a smaller venue for NHL 23 and personally I hope to get down to Arizona to watch Buffalo play there this year. I think it’s going to be quite interesting.

Q: Why hasn’t the NHL series added line brawls yet?

Sean Ramjagsingh: If you tie back to authenticity in today’s games so much focus on the skill and the creativity of the players. The fighting and the line brawls you see less and less of every single year. However I will say that in the EA Sports Hockey League the occasional line brawl will still break out.

Q: Does the ice wear impact gameplay?

Mike Inglehart: There’s a small amount of friction that affects the puck. It’s not anything that really alters the game too much. We didn’t want to have to retune the entire game based on that puck friction because it affects a lot of things. ITs a small impact you aren’t going to notice it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vc2VnbWVudG5leHQuY29tL25leHQtYmlvc2hvY2stMjAyNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next BioShock Reportedly Set in Antarctica Coming in 2024,"It has been a long time since we heard anything about a new BioShock game. Except for BioShock Remastered we haven’t seen a new game since BioShock Infinite was announced in 2013. And now the new leaks come from reliable leaker Oops Leaks. The source revealed the next title’s gameplay characters and release date.

The next BioShock title rumored to be called BioShock 4 or Isolation is supposedly an open-world game set in the Antarctic twin cities of Aurora and Borealis. The art style and in-game graphic design are similar to Deathloop and the game is apparently set in the 1960s.

The map will be a soviet metropolis constructed by slave labor provided by detainees from the camps. The source also claims that the protagonist is one of the enslaved people and wants to join the two cities together. Players will visit the rich Borealis city during the narrative.

The game is much larger than all of the previous titles. The map will affect how fighting is conducted and the combat system will be diverse with many utility and skill combinations. Some recognizable characters or clones will be back.

The next BioShock was reportedly scheduled for release earlier this year but it was delayed due to the departure of the developers. 2K hopes to reveal the game as soon as they are confident of a launch date.

2K Games and Take-Two Interactive are not rushing the development because they want to maintain the franchise’s quality. According to the leak BioShock is “the game’s entire guiding principle.” So they didn’t try to make a new game or revive the series.

Even an approximation of the game’s announcement date is yet unknown. According to different reports it should be available no later than the end of 2024. We can see the announcement at the next PlayStation showcase or Geoff Keighley’s TGA 2022 event.

But he already has big ideas about how to incubate a strong culture at the organization.

“I want everybody to feel invested in this brand” Campbell said. This includes the top North American executive himself who takes time every month to meet every new hire at the company and answer questions. He also spent a day last year working at an Adidas retail store to better understand the experience of his associates on the ground.

“It’s important that our employees see that we’re being involved in every part of the business as a leadership team” he said adding he expects to have other senior leaders come work a day in a retail store in Q4. “We have to show people that it starts from the top whatever we do.”

Campbell is speaking to FN via Zoom from an office in Canada during a two-day leadership team meeting. These gatherings which occur in a new North American Adidas office or distribution center every month are another example of how Campbell is cultivating a strong sense of belonging within the organization.

To Campbell culture is more than just time spent in an office or at home. It’s about each employee feeling as though they are part of the “fabric” of the business whether that’s through quarterly coffee chats with leadership or by singing with their colleagues in the company’s campus choir (which is expected to launch soon.)

The office Campbell explained should be an extension of these values. As such Adidas is trying to create reasons for people to want to come in for the three days a week they are required to do so. That includes free meals exercise classes and social events off-campus such as Adidas’ family day outing at a stadium in Portland that had a turnout of over 7000 employees friends and family this summer.

As Campbell put it “People expect more now.”

Adidas’ focus on culture points to a shift taking place across multiple industries and employees. After two years in flux employers have been tasked with creating culture in an ever-shifting — and sometimes remote — environment.

Business leaders seem to agree that culture means more than the occasional handshake or office happy hour. In a remote and hybrid world the need for communication validation and enjoyment has become all the more important. As priorities shift outside the office business leaders are redefining culture and determining the best way to keep it alive without relying on an office to anchor it.

Increasing flexibility

This summer Tapestry hosted a “Digital-Palooza” event that brought together about 300 people that work across the company’s digital business. The energy of the in-person forum which was meant to help build relationships and discuss digital innovation was “palpable” according to Tapestry’s global human resources officer Sarah Dunn. Tapestry the New York City-based parent company of Coach Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman operates a hybrid work model for its New York employees.

“Employees do enjoy being together” Dunn said. “But they also value flexibility.”

Across the board employers are finding that a focus on flexibility is a crucial element in the culture equation.

Almost 70% of HR leaders at mid- to large-sized companies say they have some sort of on-site requirement for employees with jobs that can be done remotely according to a recent survey from Gartner a business consulting firm. Just 5% require employees to work on-site five days a week and 31% of employers have no requirement. However some employers such as Apple and Peloton have signaled a shift towards more office time beginning in September.

“People have a fresh perspective on the importance of their life outside of work” explained David Burke senior director of talent acquisition and employer brand at Workhuman which advises business and HR leaders about culture connectivity and belonging. “Nobody really wants to go back to that five days [in the office].”

Keeping the desire for balance in mind many employers have opted for a hybrid work option which requires two to three days in the office and allows for the rest to be worked remotely. Lululemon and Amazon are some of the larger companies that have rolled out some sort of hybrid return to office plans within the last year. Nike which is also hybrid last year introduced an annual program in which it closes its global offices for a week to encourage employee well-being.

“It’s critically important that companies are providing some level of flexibility” explained Darla Pires DeGrace CEO of DeGrace Group Consulting who has worked with footwear industry leaders on workplace strategies related to DEI talent acquisition and retention.

Revamped hiring policies have also allowed companies to attract more diverse candidates geographically and situationally.

“Whether you’re caring for children family or elderly parents it definitely helps to have that flexibility” DeGrace said. “So you’re not punching a clock you’re actually getting the work done.”

But alongside the need for flexibility many employers are still emphasizing in-person collaboration.

For example Neiman Marcus Group also adopted a flexible working policy which will soon include corporate hubs across the U.S. to support in-person meet-ups. Since implementing certain remote working policies turnover at NMG was down 20% from 2019. The company which filled 1200 roles in 2021 also said the time it takes to fill a position has gone down 32% compared to 2019.

Other companies have nixed the office entirely. Bolt which offers a one-click checkout product to retailers like Forever 21 and Lucky Brand became a “remote-first” organization in March of 2020. (The company also rolled out a four-day workweek this year after a successful pilot in the fall.) And while Bolt still operates some office spaces for those who desire them there is no formal return-to-office plan set in place. According to Bolt’s Head of employee experience Angie Bagley the elements needed for a successful culture — such as access to leadership and open communication — can be achieved virtually.

“In some ways you can do it more frequently and more openly [when virtual] than when you’re in offices that are scattered across the country” Bagley said explaining how Bolt has introduced regular Q&A sessions with the CEO during the company’s monthly virtual town halls which has allowed more transparency.

Bolt’s workplace policies have translated into satisfaction among employees. In December of 2021 84% of employees said they felt like they were being more productive at work. The same percentage as recorded in a survey across about 77% of the company’s 450 U.S. and Canadian employees said they felt that their work-life balance had improved.

The employee imperative

Zappos recently held an event where employees could make their own banana splits. CREDIT: Zappos

Zappos has always been known for its zany culture and sprawling headquarters in Las Vegas.

“It was loud” Zappos employee engagement manager Maritza Lewis said when asked to describe the e-commerce company’s culture pre-pandemic. “We had parades we had potlucks we had crazy events on our campus.”

Zappos which employs around 1400 people had to evolve its culture to meet the needs of remote and hybrid work.

Now warehouse employees still work in-person everyday though corporate employees can choose how often if at all they want to come into the office. While the office is definitely quieter Zappos has kept up its strong culture by listening to its employees.

In a virtual setting Zappos has overseen a March Madness Bingo event trivia challenges and a gardening program for employees to participate in while at home a testament to the type of culture that “ebbs and flows” with the current environment as Lewis pointed out.

In-person events like all-hands meetings and a recent banana split making event are back as well. A few months ago Zappos rented out a local waterpark for employees and their family members as part of the company’s annual picnic. These events came from feedback from employees the main factor in Zappos’ decision to make moves when it comes to culture.

“The culture is always there if our employees want it to be there and it’s not one employee’s job” Lewis said. “To maintain our culture it’s everyone’s responsibility keeping the core values in mind.”

Employees are human first

For many business leaders culture also means maintaining a positive environment for employees especially while hybrid.

“Now more than ever a culture of recognition and people being thanked is so powerful” Burke said explaining how Workhuman data has found that people are half as likely to look for a new job when they feel recognized and thanked for their work.

Frequent check-ins and reviews can also help keep employees engaged and on-track with their goals. This type of engagement encourages a “feedback loop” and constant improvement Burke said. The workplace expert also said that companies should celebrate life events outside of work such as engagements weddings births and pet adoptions.

“We’re people first” Burke said. “Seeing people for who they are and seeing the whole human in relation to how we engage each other is super important.”

Caleres CEO Diane Sullivan who recently announced she would transition to the executive chairman role next year spoke to the power of this sort of recognition at the FN CEO Summit in early August. She explained how she was surprised to learn that her employees overwhelmingly gravitate towards two strong elements when it comes to the workplace according to surveys: Results and having a “caring” environment.

“At the end of the day this culture shift is fundamentally all about growth” Sullivan said. “Growth in more consumers and growth and engagement within the company.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL25ld3MyNC9iaS1hcmNoaXZlL3RoZS1mb3NjaGluaS1ncm91cC1ib29zdHMtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWZ1cm5pdHVyZS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXdpdGgtY29yaWNyYWZ0LWRpYWwtYS1iZWQtMjAyMi050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of SA's biggest fashion firms now looks to revive local furniture manufacturing,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

The Foschini Group one of South Africa's leading retail clothing groups is making big inroads into homeware and furniture.

The company's acquisition of Tapestry Home Brands which includes Coricraft Dial-a-Bed The Bed Store and Volpes was recently given the green light by the Competition Commission with certain conditions.

Part of this agreement includes opening a minimum of 35 new stores within three years under the four Tapestry brands.

Foschini expects ""to comfortably overshoot"" this target and in the process revive the local furniture manufacturing industry.

One of South Africa's top retail clothing groups The Foschini Group (TFG) has set its sights on reviving the country's furniture manufacturing sector with the recent acquisition of four familiar homeware brands.

More than 80% of TFG's annual turnover comes from clothing with a diverse portfolio of outlets covering all fashion bases. And while the group may be best known for brands like Foschini Markham Sportscene and more recently Jet TFG does dabble in homeware and furniture.

TFG's main homeware brands – @home and @homelivingspace – have been around for almost two decades. Homeware although only contributing 5.2% to TFG's turnover has grown by more than 30% over the past year according to the group's most recent results presentation.

Now TFG's homeware department is expected to surge much further ahead with the acquisition of Tapestry Home Brands which was recently approved by South Africa's Competition Commission with certain conditions. This puts Coricraft Dial-a-Bed The Bed Store and Volpes under TFG's umbrella.

In its agreement with the Competition Commission TFG committed to opening a minimum of 35 new stores within three years under the four Tapestry brands.

""We expect to comfortably overshoot this target as we bring TFG's scale and resources to bear on growing the Tapestry businesses and we have already identified the need for an additional 17 stores for Volpes alone"" said Shani Naidoo TFG group director for its homeware division in a statement on Monday.

Growing its furniture and homeware division also includes substituting products that are currently imported with locally made goods according to TFG. This coincides with TFG's move to locally sourced apparel in line with its participation in the Retail-Clothing Textile Footwear & Leather (R-CTFL) Master Plan developed to revitalise South Africa's manufacturing industry after it was decimated by cheap Chinese imports.

""As with the local manufacture of apparel we expect to realise similar commercial benefits from local production of homeware such as sofas linen and beds including improved cash flow and reduced inventory holding requirements while avoiding global supply chain disruptions and elevated freight costs"" said TFG CEO Anthony Thunström. TFG which already claims to source 73% of its apparel locally is also looking to invest in the three factories which serve the Tapestry brands.



The group cited the example of local bedding duvet and pillows brand Granny Goose and its associated manufacturer Cotton Traders which TFG bought in 2021. The group says it has grown employment at Cotton Traders by 20% in less than a year and is planning a R20 million expansion of the factory which is currently running at full capacity.

""By expanding the same vertical integration model which has been so successful in our apparel business to our home division TFG is well set following the Tapestry acquisition to reindustrialise the homeware manufacturing sector in South Africa and grow local skills and employment"" added Thunström.

Expanding on the plans to grow its apparel business as an example set for its homeware brands TFG says it's expecting to double its own local quick-response clothing production to 31 million units by 2026.

""For each one million units of quick response apparel we need two more MBUs [manufacturing business units] each with approximately 200 employees producing an average of 4200 units a day for 247 days a year"" said TFG's Merchandise and Supply Chain MD Graham Choice.

""Ultimately we need the equivalent of 30 MBUs to achieve the FY26 local manufacture target of 31 million units. This will generate more than 1820 new employment opportunities in our own factories and another 4190 in those of our strategic suppliers for a total of more than 6000 new employment opportunities in clothing manufacture alone.""

Workers in one store in Pueblo allege they have ""experienced illegal intimidation interrogation threats and harassment by Target Corporation and store management"" while trying to gather enough signatures to file a petition for an official union election according to Target Workers Unite an independent group founded by Adam Ryan 2019.

VIRGINIA TARGET WORKERS FILE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE AGAINST COMPANY OVER CLAIMS OF SPYING INTIMIDATION

Unions need to garner support from at least 30% of workers who are eligible to vote in order to hold an official election under the supervision of the U.S. National Labor Relations Board according to the agency's policies.

Store employees are trying to join the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). However Target Workers Unite is helping the unionization efforts to hold Target accountable for their alleged union busting tactics.

""As Target Workers Unite we are happy to help any Target workers in their efforts to organize and while we may have differences with UFCW we rather see Target workers succeed no matter who they affiliate with"" Ryan said in a statement to FOX Business.

Ryan further noted this is especially important ""when challenging billion-dollar corporations and Wall Street firms who do everything they can to stop us from winning living wages and full benefits that would actually improve our lives.""

Target Workers Unite allege that management at the Colorado store have been holding captive audience meetings and one-on-one interrogations while also telling workers the store will be closed if they sign authorization cards and vote to unionize the group said in a release.

A worker at the Colorado store who asked to remain anonymous told FOX Business that employees have been dealing with ""inadequate staffing poor wages and inconsistent hours"" and that the ""union busting tactics have been appalling.""

""There is no real open door policy in the store when HR and upper management are not trusted by employees. They give you the option to report to an integrity hotline but those reports just cycle back to those higher up that are in question"" the employee said. ""Nothing gets accomplished this way as there is no one to fight for the employee.""

Target told FOX Business that its ""team members are at the heart of our strategy and success"" and that the company has a ""deep commitment to listening to our team and creating an environment of mutual trust where every team member’s voice matters.""

The company said it wants all of its employees ""to be better off for working at Target"" and that it's spent years investing in its culture of care including adding a starting wage range of $15 to $24 per hour expanding health care benefits and offering debt-free education assistance.

User u/galaxy-m81 gained over 61000 upvotes and nearly 2000 comments when they posted a photo of the untouched completely intact cafe to Reddit.

Now much like the young couple who made a shocking discovery in the attic while renovating their 108-year-old house this Redditor’s stunning find has people yearning for the past.

In the post entitled “This Target cafe hasn’t changed since the 90s” u/galaxy-m81 tapped into people’s longing for the ’90s — and for the festive decor of yesteryear.

“Looks so much better compared to the bland colors everything is adopting nowadays” one user wrote.

“Honestly why would you change it” asked another user.

“I miss the neon on the walls” one user reminisced.

“I can smell the popcorn” wrote another.

“The modern minimalist corporate aesthetic is perhaps the worst aesthetic I can think of” commented another user.

“Flat/minimalist design sucks and stamps the personality out of everything” wrote one user.

“Bring back whimsy” another user demanded.

“They need to bring fun back to places. Everything turned so ugly and corporate. I miss old looking Taco Bell” commented another.

Another Redditor yearned for the Taco Bell of yore and posted a vintage photo to the r/90s subreddit.

“Fast food takes itself so seriously these days” one user commented on the post.

“I miss the old style. Now everything is just the same and lifeless” wrote another user.

Burger King also enjoyed some time in the vintage spotlight when a man named Jonathan Pruitt discovered a completely intact restaurant hidden behind the wall of a mall in Wilmington DE.

“The Holy Grail: a vintage intact Burger King abandoned since 2009” the title read.

Pruitt originally posted the discovery to the Facebook group “All Things Delaware” where it quickly went viral.

The untouched burger joint enjoyed a second wave of virality when Twitter user @loserskwaddd uploaded a video of the space.

This Brooklyn home office gets a California-inspired makeover with just $1000:

But these fast-food time capsules don’t simply contain fun retro aesthetics of the nineties. They provide windows into people’s childhoods bringing them back to seemingly simpler times.

User u/buckeye_man18 provided such a window when his unchanged Pizza Hut post went viral on r/Nostalgia.

“I recently went to [a Pizza Hut] to pickup my order. The salad bar was gone as was the arcade no one else was in there. I don’t think I had been in one in over 20 years. The memories hit me so hard and seeing those things missing really broke my heart. Many good memories after sporting events and performances would be had there in my childhood. And now they are just sad and empty” one user wrote.

An unchanged Wendy’s also went viral when user u/CranberryMcNuggo posted a photo to r/MildlyInteresting.

“Bruh I love that 90s/very early 2000s looks. It reminds me of simpler times. It always comforts me” one user commented.

“Dave Thomas is smiling down on this slice of 90’s heaven” quipped another user.

It can be hard to accept that time is ever-marching and style ever-evolving.

After all today’s youth might one day yearn for the “modern minimalist corporate aesthetic” of the Pizza Huts and Taco Bells of their own childhoods.

But while it’s fun to look back and reminisce it’s important also to embrace and celebrate the here and now — and to appreciate that perhaps fast food’s best days are behind us.

With just $1000 and one day this Harlem bedroom gets a brand new look:

What is a Type ""B"" Reorganization?

Under § 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code a Type B reorganization involves the acquisition of stock of a corporation in exchange solely for voting stock of either the acquiring corporation or its parent. A Type B reorganization can be effected either by exchanging existing stock or by issuing new stock of the acquiring corporation directly to the target corporation in exchange for the target corporation's newly issued or treasury stock.

Additionally the acquiring corporation must have ""control"" of the acquired corporation immediately after the acquisition. Control is defined under § 368(c) as possession of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of each class of nonvoting stock.

In structuring a Type B reorganization practitioners must pay close attention to the ""solely for voting stock"" requirement. The question of whether certain types of transactions violate that requirement have been the subject of multiple revenue rulings and cases. Here are just two examples:

An acquiring corporation may pay other consideration for the target corporation's non-stock interest without violating the requirement. See Rev. Rul. 98-10 (involving debentures). A target may also redeem stock of some shareholders for cash or other property to buy out minority or dissenting shareholders where the cash is not provided by the acquiring corporation. See Treas. § 1.368-1(e)(8) Example 9; Rev. Rul. 68-285. By extension dividends that are paid by the acquiring corporation contemporaneously with the tax-free acquisition in the ordinary course also should not necessarily be considered disguised boot.

Blue J's diagramming tool provides a convenient way to collaborate on a shared diagram with colleagues to visually represent any reorganization including multi-step transactions to which the step transaction doctrine may apply. We host example diagrams in our Blue J Folios which may be easily edited to depict any transaction–or build your own. Blue J Folios provide a starting point for your research with an outline that summarizes the topic and contains references from the Code and Treasury Regulations common leading authorities on each topic and a visualization of certain authorities using our Diagramming tool.

High Yield Dividend King #20: Target Corporation (TGT)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Target is a giant discount retailer. Its business consists of about 1850 big box stores which offer general merchandise and food as well as serving as distribution points for the company’s burgeoning e-commerce business. Target should produce about $110 billion in total revenue this year.

Target reported first quarter earnings on May 18th 2022 and results were much worse than expected from a margin perspective. Adjusted earnings-per-share missed estimates by 87 cents at $2.19. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $25.2 billion which was $690 million ahead of estimates.

Comparable sales grew 3.3% which was due to traffic growth of 3.9% and a slightly lower average ticket size. Store comparable sales were up 3.4% while digital comparable sales grew 3.2%. Operating income was $1.3 billion down from $2.4 billion driven primarily by a lower gross margin rate. Gross margins plunged from 30.0% to 25.7% of sales due to higher markdowns and costs related to freight supply chain disruptions and increased wages.

The company noted operating margin rate should be roughly where it was in Q1 for Q2 and the company expects to see low- to mid-single digit revenue growth and operating income margin around 6% for the year.

Last year the company generated $14.5 billion in revenue. The company is geographically diversified with more than half of its revenue generated outside of the United States.

On August 2nd 2022 Illinois Tool Works reported second quarter 2022 results for the period ending June 30th 2022. For the quarter revenue came in at $4.0 billion up 9% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% in the Automotive OEM segment the largest out of the company’s seven segments. Five of the other segments saw sales growth above 20% with the last segment being flat. Net income equaled $738 million or $2.37 per share compared to $775 million or $2.45 per share in Q2 2021.

Source: Investor Presentation

Illinois Tool Works also reiterated its 2022 earnings guidance and sees $9.00 to $9.40 in earnings-per-share for the full year. At the same time the company reduced its revenue growth estimates to 6% to 9% (down from 8.5% to 11.5%). The company also plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2022.

Illinois Tool Works has an excellent dividend growth history. Its payout ratio was relatively high during the last financial crisis but the company was not forced to cut the payout. Today the dividend payout ratio sits at 53% of expected earnings above the company’s long-term target meaning that future dividend growth may trail earnings growth.

High Yield Dividend King #18: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Dividend Yield: 2.4%

Procter & Gamble is a consumer products giant that sells its products in over 180 countries.

Source: Investor Presentation

Procter & Gamble’s dividend payout ratio has oscillated between 50% and 75% in the last decade with the current mark coming in around 60%. This is somewhat high for your typical company but well within a reasonable range for such a high-quality firm. We believe that the company can keep growing its dividend at a rate roughly in line with earnings-pershare growth going forward.

Procter & Gamble has significant competitive advantages thanks to its strong brands. The company has several categoryleading brands. These brands provide Procter & Gamble with pricing power and consistent profits in good times or bad. During the Great Recession the company posted earnings-per-share of $3.04 $3.64 $3.58 $3.53 and $3.93 in the 2007 through 2011 stretch while the dividend kept on rising.

Cincinnati Financial is an insurance company founded in 1950. It offers business home auto insurance and financial products including life insurance annuities property and casualty insurance. Cincinnati Financial is headquartered in Fairfield Ohio trading with a $20.1 billion market capitalization.

As an insurance company Cincinnati Financial makes money in two ways. It earns income from premiums on policies written and by investing its float or the large sum of money consisting of the time value between the premium income and insurance claims.

Cincinnati Financial has grown earnings by 11.5% per year over the past nine years and 15.6% over the past five years. Consensus analysts expect earnings to grow by 6% for the next five years. Book value a significant metric for insurance companies has increased by 10.4% over the past nine years and 8.4% over the past five years.

Unlike many insurers the company is not a significant buyer of its shares for per-share growth. The company makes most of its net income from its investment gains and is highly dependent on bond interest rates and stock market performance. Cincinnati Financial is a somewhat aggressive investor and has a 39.3% allocation to equities compared to many insurers. This gives the company better long-term portfolio growth but a bit more volatility.

Dividend Yield: 2.6%

High Yield Dividend King #12: Computer Services (CSVI)

Dividend Yield: 2.9%

Computer Services provides regional banks with a wide range of services such as core processing digital banking payments processing and regulatory compliance solutions.

In early May Computer Services reported (5/4/2022) financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company grew its revenue by 7% from $75.5 million to a nearly all-time high of $81.0 million and its earnings-per-share by 24% from $0.49 to $0.61 thanks to new accounts continued demand for digital banking services and higher demand for payments processing and regulatory compliance.

Notably approximately 90% of the total revenues are generated from long-term contracts. Management expects to accelerate investments in the business in the new fiscal year.

Given also higher staffing levels and a return to pre-pandemic travel levels management expects earnings growth to somewhat decelerate later this year. In September Computer Services raised its dividend by 8.0% which marked the 50th consecutive year of dividend growth.

Computer Services has grown its earnings-per-share at an 11.3% average annual rate over the last decade. The pandemic has not affected the performance of Computer Services at all. Thanks to sustained momentum in the core business and no signs of fatigue we expect it to grow its earnings-per-share by 7.0% per year over the next five years.

The impressive growth record of Computer Services is a testament to the strength of its business model and the existence of a significant competitive advantage. The company signs multi-year contracts with its customers and offers them a wide range of services. It is very costly and inefficient for these customers to stop working with the

company particularly given that they pay appreciable early termination fees.

As a result Computer Services enjoys high renewal rates. In fact when it loses a customer the most frequent reason is that the bank has been acquired by another bank that is not a customer of Computer Services.

Teledyne FLIR is a global name in thermal and visible imaging. With SIRAS Teledyne FLIR has equipped a reliable user-friendly drone with their world-class imaging solutions including visible and thermal cameras; and features designed to meet the security needs of public safety and government agencies – all with U.S.-based service and support.

User-Centric Design

Product Manager Kelly Brodbeck explains that SIRAS was developed around the end user. “We maintain focus groups with end users all the time” he says. “We benefit from all of our contacts – we’re constantly talking to people and looking for consistencies across their areas of expertise: public safety oil and gas industry.” The decision not to use geofencing was the direct result of user feedback. “This is about giving the pilot control: for public safety in particular users really don’t want geofencing – that’s just unacceptable. They need to get the drone into the air as quickly as possible.”

The choice to keep data on an SD card without any cloud connection is also user driven. “Heavy industry is really concerned about where their data is going” Brodbeck explains. “Even if it’s not national security they’re concerned about intellectual property. The mechanism for how someone could take your data is well understood: and we heard this over and over. ”

Ezra Merrill Senior Director of Marketing says the SD card is a solution that works for any customer with concerns about where their data goes. “We simplified everything” he says. “The data is on an SD card on the drone. That’s it.” Teledyne FLIR also doesn’t require users to set up any kind of an account before they fly allowing users to be anonymous if they choose to be.

It’s all About the Imaging

Teledyne FLIR is the world’s largest developer of thermal cameras. The included Vue® TV32 payload includes a 16MP visible camera which can zoom 32x: while the integrated 640×512 pixel radiometric Boson® provides best-in-class thermal imagery 5x digital zoom and temperature-measurement of every pixel.

The SIRAS payload offers the leading imaging capabilities users expect from Teledyne FLIR. “Because of the camera that we have here and all of its capabiltities our image just has more pixels on target compared with other drones on the market” says Brodbeck. “The high resolution EO camera means that as you zoom in you just don’t lose pixels – it’s really incredible.”

SIRAS is also the only enterprise drone currently using Teledyne FLIR’s patented MSX® technology. “MSX makes thermal data easier to understand” says Merrill. MSX overlays thermal imaging and visible imaging embossing the edges – in real time to add more detail and context to a thermal image.

Compelling Price Point

SIRAS – payload included – is priced at $9695. As a professional drone from the US that’s a great price – and is partly due Teledyne FLIR’s market power. “We’re not a startup. Teledyne FLIR is part of Teledyne Inc – it’s a $4.5 billion company. We’re able to work with our supply chain differently than a smaller company can” Merrill comments.

Enterprise UAS will be the exclusive master distributor and service and support will be handled through them – another important feature for industrial and public safety clients based in the US. “Our customers are excited about the quality and features for the price and the fact that it’s an American brand” says Brodbeck. “Customers are looking for somebody local that they can call when there is an issue.”

The SIRAS aircraft was designed in collaboration with and is manufactured by Coretronic Intelligent Robotics Corporation (CIRC) in Taiwan a subsidiary of Coretronic Group. Final payload integration and quality control are completed in the USA.

SIRAS will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of 2022 in the US with additional regional availability information provided at www.teledyneflir.com/siras. SIRAS is dual use and classified under US Department of Commerce jurisdiction as EAR 6A003.b.4.a.

Courtesy Dometic

Cable throttle and shift controls still dominate the boating market for outboard inboard and sterndrive engines. Cables from brands such as Dometic Marine (previously SeaStar) and Uflex provide smooth reliable service for years even decades but they might eventually wear out corrode or otherwise lose optimal functionality. Here’s what to look for when deciding on replacement throttle and shift cables for your boat.

When to Replace

“The control lever should move smoothly and freely” says David Wolfe product and support manager for Dometic Marine whose cables dominate the US boating market. “­Typically if the movement is stiff sticky or causes clunking when shifting it’s time to replace the cable.”

Also if the lever does not repeat a shift command (such as forward neutral or reverse) at the same position or angle every time it often means the cable is wearing out and requires replacement Wolfe advises.

Rather than replace just the one suspect cable boaters are advised to replace both the throttle and shift cables at the same time. One faltering cable serves as a signal that the other might not be too far behind.

Regular or Premium

There are two grades of ­engine control cables: standard and premium versions. ­Dometic calls its premium series Xtreme while Uflex calls its the Mach ­series. Uflex also offers standard cables but Dometic is ­gradually phasing out its standard version which uses a solid metal core. However you will still find some ­under the SeaStar brand in retail distribution.

The premium versions are more expensive. In ­Dometic’s case the Xtreme cables cost about 15 to 20 percent more than its standard cables but they feature splined cores. The ridges of the splined core glide back and forth in a lubricated HDPE liner that allows for smoother control than standard cables and without sacrificing ­precision in shifting and throttle control Wolfe says.

Performance Bend

Premium cables offer ­another advantage: the ability to bend more tightly than standard cables. The Xtreme cables for instance offer a 4-inch bend radius while the tightest turn a standard cable can tolerate is 8 inches.

Here’s the upshot: While a premium cable costs more it will turn tighter corners in the rigging tube transom and elsewhere than a standard cable can accommodate and still ­provide optimal throttle and shift performance.

Throttle and shift cables are available with a range of connectors to fit different motors and drives.

Original vs. Aftermarket

Major marine engine brands such as Honda Mercury Suzuki Volvo Penta and ­Yamaha offer control cables as original equipment. With this in mind is it smarter to source cables from the ­engine brand?

“Almost all marine engine manufacturers use Dometic’s Xtreme series cables” Wolfe says. So whether you buy OEM or Xtreme cables you are getting the same thing.

“Honda Suzuki Tohatsu Volvo and Yamaha use the Xtreme CCX633 style” he points out. “Mercury and MerCruiser use the CCX179 (Gen1) and CCX189 (Gen II) series. Evinrude and Johnson outboards match up with the CCX205 series.”

Determining Lengths

Cables must be the ­proper length—long enough to reach from the throttle and shift controls to the engine but not excessively long. In retrofits use the same length as the cable you are replacing. The length is normally stamped on the jacket of the cable ­usually (but not always) on the helm end. “You can also find the style of the cable stamped in white here” Wolfe says. If you can’t find the size on the old cable (sometimes these wear off) measure it from tip to tip.

In situations where there are no existing cables measure from the helm control along an unobstructed path to the connection points at the engine or shift point. Then round up to the nearest foot for ordering the new cable. Aftermarket ­cables are sold in foot increments up to 30 feet with longer cables sold in only even-foot increments.

For outboards throttle and shift cables are the same length while the throttle and shift cables for inboard and sterndrive system differ in length because one goes to the engine and the other to the transmission or drive.

Route it Right

Routing the cables from the helm control to the motor—or vice versa—might be as simple as taping the ends of the old cables to the new ones and pulling them from one end to the other. If you can’t use the old cables use a pull cord or an electrician’s fish tape.

Typically control ­cables run through a rigging tube belowdecks or along the starboard side of the boat. Once the cables are installed it’s important to avoid binding them too tightly with zip ties Wolfe advises. “Keep them loose and avoid binding them together with onboard wires or other cables” he says. “This will help ensure the smoothest possible shifting and throttle action.”

Outboard Loop

For outboards Wolfe recommends creating a 4-foot loop in the cables before they connect to the motor. This prevents binding when the outboard turns from side to side and trims up and down. Take this into account when measuring for new cables.

Many of today’s outboards however use transom rigging tubes that do not readily allow for a big loop in the cables. In these cases make sure the rigging tube is long enough to leave a fair amount of slack to accommodate the control ­cables as the outboard rotates trims and tilts Wolfe says.

Nuts on the ends of throttle and shift cables tighten against connectors to keep them in place.

Correct Connectors

To ensure you have the proper cable connectors for your propulsion system you can reuse the old connectors for the helm control engine and transmission assuming they are in good working condition Wolfe says. Companies such as Dometic and Uflex—as well as the engine brands—offer the proper connectors if you choose to replace them.

In either case wait until after the cables are routed before installing any connectors. This streamlines the cables and makes it easier to pull them through crowded rigging tubes and access ports.

My Tesla Recharged Itself While Driving

I have a Tesla Model 3 RWD that I got just over two weeks ago. Something interesting happened during that time one day while I went up to a hike in the mountains. My car charged 6% of its battery during my drive back down the mountain.

Tesla's have a very genius feature called regenerative braking. What this means is that when your foot is not on the accelerator in a Tesla the car will slow down and put back the energy that dissipates into the battery. Essentially the kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted into energy and stored in the battery.

The electric motor makes this possible by having it function as an electric generator. Tesla's regenerative braking is so powerful that if you time it right you should hardly ever have to use your brakes to stop your car.

Two situations will cause regenerative braking: Pressing the brake pedal and releasing the accelerator pedal such as when the vehicle is coasting down a hill or when you are exiting the freeway at a high speed and simply let your foot off of the accelerator. Each of these situations creates electricity to charge the battery.

The Power of Regenerative Braking Over Gas Cars

Looking at the above image you can see that on my trip down the mountain I was getting at least 300 Wh/mile being put back into the vehicle to charge. I went from 67% to 73% during this downhill drive. 6% of my battery was recovered. Going up the hill to the mountain took a tremendous amount of energy as well.

The advantage of this over a gas car is staggering. Imagine driving a gas car up a hill. As you drive up it takes a lot more gas to get up the hill just like it takes a lot more of the battery to get up the hill.

When it comes time to drive back down the hill two things are superior for the EV that uses regenerative braking. The first is that the EV will not use the brakes while going down hill saving on brake wear and tear. The gas car will causing wear and tear.

The second is that the EV will make heavy use of regenerative braking while going down the hill. My Tesla Model 3 RWD got 6% of its battery back on my downhill drive of about 12 miles. The gas car going down hill will have to continually use its brakes to slow down and there will be no extra gas added to the car. It will simply consume energy - albeit much less while going down hill.

This is the power of regenerative braking. When used properly and properly timed I can get over 300 miles of range on my Tesla Model 3 RWD. It simply is a matter of timing and forward thinking especially when getting off the freeway going down hill or approaching a red light or stop sign. It's similar to hypermile driving in a gas car.

What do you think of Tesla's regenerative braking? Is this superior to a gas car?

On Aug. 29 the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) in a 3-2 decision ruled in Tesla Inc. 370 NLRB (2022) that workplace dress codes and uniform policies that prevent employees from wearing pro-union apparel of any type even if facially neutral are presumptively unlawful.

Tesla had a policy requiring employees to wear Tesla-provided or all black clothing while at work. When workers at its Fremont California facility began wearing pro-union apparel Tesla instructed them to stop wearing such items in violation of its dress code. The UAW challenged this ban and NLRB prosecutors brought a broad complaint in August 2017 that included this issue.

In its holding the NLRB with Democratic members Lauren McFerran David Prouty and Gwynne Wilcox in the majority held that such policies even if facially neutral are presumptively unlawful and violations of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act unless such policies are justified by “special circumstances.” With this decision the NLRB overruled the Trump Board’s holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 368 NLRB 146 (2019).

The previous standard in the Wal-Mart decision drew a distinction between an employer’s complete ban on union insignia and an employer’s mere regulation of the type and/or manner in which employees donned union insignia for which employers had much wider latitude to regulate. Now any union insignia donned by an employee – no matter how big distracting or gaudy – is protected unless the employer can demonstrate that “special circumstances” exist justifying the employer’s regulation of such activity. Republican NLRB members Marvin Kaplan and John Ring who were part of the Wal-Mart majority dissented in the Tesla decision.

To illustrate what qualifies as a “special circumstance” the NLRB pointed to another decision Komatsu 342 NLRB 649 (2004) which outlined employee safety quality control public image and workplace decorum as possible justifications for broad dress code restrictions.

On their face these categories could conceivably be used to justify any employer restriction. In practice however employers likely will be hard-pressed to demonstrate special circumstances in most cases. Indeed the NLRB made it clear in Tesla that in any case “involving a restriction on the display of union insignia the NLRB “[will] engage in a rigorous fact-specific inquiry to determine whether the employer actually established the presence of special circumstances in the context of its workplace.” For example in the case at hand the NLRB rejected Tesla’s reason for banning metal buttons which it claimed might scratch and damage cars. The rejection of this reasoning makes it clear that justifications will likely be met with skepticism and employers must be careful moving forward.

Employers should be aware that this decision affects both union and non-union workplaces. In light of this decision employers with written dress code policies might want to review their current policies and handbooks to ensure they do not interfere with the right of employees to wear or display union insignia in the absence of special circumstances. Likewise employers may also want to make sure this is not an issue in practice and that supervisors are aware of these changes so that employees are not wrongfully disciplined.

Finally employers should expect more decisions like this one from the NLRB in coming months. The pro-labor agenda signaled by this Board and the Biden administration seems to be finally playing out. This decision is not only a marked transformation from the previous Board but a clear indication that more aggressive measures and changes are on the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2luc2lkZS10ZXNsYXMtZHJpdmUta2VlcC1tdXNrcy1iYXR0ZXJ5LXByb21pc2UtMjAyMi0wOS0wNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insight: Inside Tesla's drive to keep Musk's battery promise,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-teslas-drive-keep-musks-battery-promise-2022-09-06/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2luc2lkZS10ZXNsYXMtZHJpdmUta2VlcC1tdXNrcy1iYXR0ZXJ5LXByb21pc2UtMjAyMi0wOS0wNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDUvbm9yd2VnaWFuLXRlc2xhLW93bmVyLWh1bmdlci1zdHJpa2Utb3JpZy1odC5jbm4tYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Tesla owners are going to great lengths to get Elon Musk’s attention,"1.

In both cases the Teslas—which were different models and years—plowed into the riders from behind. Both crashes happened at night and both involved cruiser-type motorcycles with low-set close-together taillights.

Why do those details about the bikes matter? In this video Ryan from FortNine lays out a well-reasoned theory about why Autopilot might not have seen the riders in these cases. To be clear it’s just a theory—and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as well as other authorities are still investigating both crashes.

That said the theory seems pretty solid. See Teslas used to rely on a combination of multiple cameras and radar to help functionalities like Autopilot calculate safe distance to the vehicles and other objects around a given Tesla. However Tesla has been phasing out its use of radars across its model range over time moving them over to its Tesla Vision camera-only system. The most recent such change happened in February 2022 when Tesla removed radar units from its Model S and Model X according to our colleagues at InsideEVs.

Not A New Problem:

Now even if you’re a person who doesn’t really care much about cars and who mainly focuses your energy on motorbikes you’ve probably heard a lot about radar-adaptive cruise control in the past few years. Multiple motorcycle OEMs have been rolling out their takes on such systems on their most premium models. Although the systems may work slightly differently the idea is the same—all rely on radar to help the bikes maintain a safe distance from vehicles around them. Moto OEMs don’t call it “autopilot” for a number of reasons—but it performs some of the same functions only it relies on the proven accuracy of radar.

Why not use both radar and cameras you may ask? As Ryan F9 points out although Tesla (and most companies) will not directly state that it wants to make money as a primary motivational factor businesses are after all businesses. Therefore the idea that they want to make money should certainly not be news and should probably be regarded as an implicit factor in all their decision-making. Individuals and companies may also want to do good things or to be perceived as doing socially-good things by the public—but the underlying motivation to make money is never not a factor.

The placement of those taillights on both bikes involved—a Yamaha V-Star and a Harley-Davidson Sportster—matters if both cars were relying on Tesla Vision to tell them where the next vehicle on the highway was. Tesla Vision relies on a system of multiple cameras and AI which interprets the visual data gathered by the cameras.

At night it’s difficult to make out vehicle silhouettes—but you can usually see taillights. If the AI perceived those close-together taillights as being faraway car headlights instead of a much closer motorcycle—well there’s the problem. Had a radar been involved perhaps the problem could have been avoided—but we can’t know for sure.

What we do know is that two riders are dead—and also that NHTSA data released in June 2022 revealed that “Tesla’s vehicles have been found to shut off the advanced driver-assistance system Autopilot around one second before impact” according to the Washington Post. That observation came from analysis of 273 previous Tesla Autopilot-involved crashes.

What can riders do? Apart from reaching out to your local legislators to demand action the most immediate suggestion that Ryan F9 has is that if you’re riding on a highway at night and you see headlights behind you—move from side to side in your lane. Hopefully that movement will alert the possible AI behind you that you’re a vehicle that’s much closer than it might expect. It’s a frustrating bandaid on a serious problem but at the same time it might not be terrible advice to keep in mind."
TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy9kLWNlby8yMDIyL3NlcHRlbWJlci9ub3J0aC10ZXhhcy1pcy10aGUtY291bnRyeXMtbmV3LXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1jYXBpdGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Texas Is the Country's New Semiconductor Manufacturing Capital,"It’s being compared to Silicon Valley. Some have dubbed it Silicon Alley—or more aptly Silicon Prairie. And if you haven’t already bought land for development along the 30-mile stretch of U.S. 75 north of McKinney to Sherman you’re facing skyrocketed land prices.

In a tale that’s similar to what happened with the suburbs of Plano Frisco and Richardson some 20 to 30 years ago the once sleepy towns of Anna Melissa Sherman and Van Alstyne are becoming the new hotbed for the region’s growth with the promise of an estimated 4500 jobs coming to the area within the next five years.

Last November Texas Instruments announced that it would build a $30 billion 4.7-million-square-foot semiconductor fabrication plant in Sherman—the largest electronic production facility in the state and among the biggest manufacturing facilities in the country. Fending off a bid to bring the plant to Singapore the town with a population of 44873 located about 60 miles north of Dallas landed its big fish bringing with it a projected 3000 jobs that will pay an average of $55000 per year. TI broke ground on the first two phases of the project in May and is expected to begin delivering products from its Sherman plants by 2025.

Portfolio Major Projects at a Glance Texas Instruments The hometown icon is planning four 300-millimeter semiconductor wafer fabrication plants in Sherman. The new manufacturing facilities will produce millions of analog and embedded processing chips that go into electronics. GlobiTech A subsidiary of Taiwan-based Global Wafers Co. GlobiTech was founded by three former TI employees. The new $5 billion Sherman facility will create 1500 jobs and represents the first new silicon wafer facility to open in the United States in two decades. Anacapri The Anacapri housing development in Anna located west of Anna High School is a lagoon-anchored 1239-home development that will cost approximately $800 million. In addition to the crystal lagoon it will include two beaches—one that is open to the public—as a tourist draw for the area.

Just about a month later in June global semiconductor manufacturer GlobiTech awarded its $5 billion 1500-job project to Sherman too. To lure GlobiTech’s semiconductor plant the Sherman Economic Development Corp. offered $20 million in cash payments and the sale of nearly 150 acres of land worth more than an estimated $14.4 million. The Texas Enterprise Fund added an additional $15 million grant to the incentive package. Meanwhile the city of Sherman Grayson County and Grayson College offered tax incentives and discounted utilities. The global semiconductor manufacturer was also considering sites in Ohio and South Korea before choosing to make North Texas its permanent home.

“These are once-in-a-lifetime projects for our region” says Kent Sharp president of the Sherman Economic Development Corp. “You work your entire career in economic development with the hopes of being part of a deal that has a ‘B’ in front of it—and we’ve landed two in the past year.”

Rooftops and Residents

Homebuilders have taken notice of the flurry of semiconductor projects coming soon to Sherman—and it is having a ripple effect for towns along the Highway 75 corridor. “Anna is one of the fastest-growing towns in North Texas and we’re proud to be a part of the positive growth story there” said Mehrdad Moayedi president and CEO of Farmers Branch-based Centurion American when he broke ground on the Villages of Hurricane Creek development earlier this year. Phase one of the project is underway and in total will include 1794 single-family lots 400 multifamily units and 60000 square feet of new commercial development.

Anacapri by Megatel is another housing project that broke ground earlier this year. Announced in October 2021 the $800 million development includes 1239 single-family homes 600 multifamily units and a 2.3-acre crystal lagoon. Megatel has sold every phase one lot in the forthcoming development.

Blue Lagoon Anna is the latest city in North Texas to join the lagoon craze with the new Anacapri development.

National homebuilders are getting in on the action too. Construction is set to commence later this year on Bloomfield Homes’ Crystal Park in Anna which includes 981 single-family lots and 82 acres of mixed-use. D.R. Horton plans 942 single-family lots and 600 multifamily units at its new The Woods at Lindsey Place development in Anna. And Meritage Homes will add 456 homes at Wolf Creek Farms The Quarry at Stoneridge and Bryant Farms in Melissa.

It all adds up to more residents making the Highway 75 corridor home. According to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau population estimates Melissa has seen 21.8 percent population growth since 2020 growing from 13941 to an estimated 16983. For Anna its population is up 19.5 percent from 16935 to 20243. Sherman has added more than 6000 residents in the last two years seeing its population balloon from 38521 at the 2010 census to its current population estimate of 44873.

Though its neighbors to the south McKinney and Frisco have seen double-digit drops in homebuilding permits in the first half of 2022 Anna’s residential permits are up 15 percent for 635 permits this year. Meanwhile Melissa saw a 2 percent gain at mid-year over a year ago with 522 total permits. Sherman’s housing permits have more than doubled from 154 in June of 2021 to 316 permits at the halfway point of 2022.

And there are few signs of slowing says Anna’s economic development director Joey Grisham. As Texas Instruments and GlobiTech complete their initial phases in the coming years he expects to see spinoff companies suppliers and customers from these two giants move to the area similar to what happened with TI in Dallas and Richardson in decades prior.

“My phone has been ringing off the hook with interest” Grisham says. “It’s definitely an exciting time for the Dallas-Fort Worth region as a whole—and there’s no better time than now to do business in north Collin County.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLmNvbS9zZW5zb3JzL2NoaXAtbGVhZC10aW1lcy01Mi13ZWVrcy1leHBlY3RlZC1sYXN0LWZldy15ZWFycy1yYW5kLWV4cGVydC1zYXlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip lead times of 52 weeks expected to last a few years Rand expert says,"While the US CHIPS Act provides $52 billion for domestic chip manufacturing and research it will be years before ambitious plans for expensive fabs built by Intel Micron and others reach the chip production stage.

The Act goes a long way to start bringing back manufacturing to the US now down to 12% of global production according to advocates.

However the chip shortage first seen a few months into the pandemic in 2020 isn’t going away according to Jennifer Strawn head of sourcing for the Americas and EMEA for Rand Technology a global component sourcing company for more than 30 years.

In a recent interview with Fierce Electronics she said average lead times to place an order for a chip and receive it have increased to 52 weeks compared to eight to 12 weeks prior to the pandemic in 2020.

She warned chip customers that “anything short of 52 weeks lead time is expected to last for several years.”

After the awareness of a chip shortage sunk in early in 2021 major companies such as Texas Instruments Nvidia and Micron decided to change their planning approach to have a sufficient supply. “In order to get their head around it and gauge demand they had to decide what was real demand” Strawn said.

Some companies entered NCNR orders meaning non-cancelable and non-reschedulable with suppliers but in the early part of 2022 they weren’t sure when chip delivery would come which led to buying on the open market. For OEMs that process of open market buying on top of NCNRs often led to too much inventory which is one reason companies supplying chips are now reporting low demand into coming quarters.

“It’s a butterfly effect” Strawn said.

In a sense the pandemic had a positive impact because it has forced companies to rethink their supply chain strategies. Ultimately that could prove to be a good thing.

“Yes Covid has been a catalyst for how we needed to have the right mindset with risk mitigation and supply assurance” Strawn said. “The thinking was to lean into suppliers and you’ll have the strongest chance of navigating through uncharted waters and what is the right supply. The road is still not clear but the path is being carved.”

Chip companies are also facing trade embargoes and global inflation affecting demand and a continuing war in Ukraine. The most vivid example of a potential shortage is with neon produced in Ukraine used by various fabs in the chipmaking process. Many chip producers already had plenty of neon before the war broke out in February but as the war continues shortages of neon “could be very problematic in 2023” Strawn warned.

“Every day geopolitics become more heated and are going to pose ongoing disruptions as electronics companies think about strategies and products and components” Strawn said. “It shows more than ever the importance of steps being taken to bring fabs to the U.S. so geopolitical issues don’t become so devastating.”

What You Need To Know Linda Watson Guillory holds the Guinness World Record for largest collection of LCD Gaming Systems at 1599 and largest collection of playable gaming systems at 2430



The official process took about four years and cost around $1000



Linda hopes to use her knowledge of vintage video games to educate children and pique their interest in STEM learning

“I love doing things with my hands fixing games and doing things with electronics” Guillory said. “When I first started collecting I would buy broken games and try to fix them.”

In fact that’s how she fell in love with them at a young age. Guillory recalls her family buying her childhood games from thrift stores like Goodwill and the Salvation Army. She says most of the time they were broken.

“We would have to take them apart and try to fix them” she recalled. “I didn’t know at the time it was something I loved but I did. I learned to love it probably because I was doing it with my dad.”

Guillory says her collection started when she purchased a few childhood memories.

“I had one curio [cabinet] and it got full so I decided to buy a second curio to space out the games and I filled that up” Guillory said.

Guillory’s friend dubbed her a collector a title she called crazy. But once she embraced it Guillory decided she wanted to be the best.

“If I’m going to be a collector I’m going to be the best collector there is and I’m going to get everything” she insisted.

No boundary or ocean has kept Guillory from getting her hands on vintage electronic games. She’s traveled the world to find extremely rare and invaluable games.

Some of her favorites include Coleco Pacman Tandy Cosmic 200 Fire Away Soopa Doopa by Toytronic and Epoch Galaxy II.

Guillory is proud to say she’s been talking about vintage electronic games for years and during that time she has been asked if her collection was worthy of a world record. With no knowledge of a collection as big as hers she applied for the world record in 2016.

The process with Guinness World Records took around four years. Guillory says there’s two options when applying and she opted for the more affordable route. Guillory gathered her own volunteers and counters and underwent a thorough documentation process.

“I had to rent a room in a public location announce it to the public so that they could come see and observe” Guillory said.

She estimates the total process cost around $1000 which saved Guillory about $11000.

Guillory was recognized for two records: the largest collection of playable gaming systems at 2430 and the largest collection of LCD gaming systems at 1599.

Guillory is an electrical engineer in adulthood and currently works for Texas Instruments as an assembly strategy manager.

Guillory loves to talk about her world records because she hopes to impart knowledge about electronic games and keep the knowledge and love of them alive. She hopes to one day design gaming kits for kids to help pique their interest in electronics and STEM learning.

As for her collection she says she probably has more than 3000 playable systems but has no plans to update her record. At least not until someone breaks it.

“I’ll re-break the record” Guillory said with a big smile on her face.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2QtY2VvLzIwMjIvYXVndXN0L21lZXQtcmlzay10YWtlci1hbmQtc3Rvcnl0ZWxsZXItdGluYS15b3VuZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Risk-Taker and Storyteller Tina Young,"Tina Young Marketwave founder & CEO

The breakfast crowd was buzzing as I joined Tina Young at a bright orange table at Snooze in Addison. During the heart of the pandemic the Marketwave founder and CEO would often sit and work on the eatery’s patio she tells me just to get away. Along with its funky 1970s-era décor the restaurant chain is known for its inventive breakfast sweets like Pineapple Upside Down Cake Pancakes and Funky Monkey French Toast. Young bypasses those options and instead orders a three-egg scramble with spinach mushrooms and avocado—throwing in some bacon at the last minute too.

A native Texan who grew up in Plano she studied journalism at the University of North Texas and minored in marketing. When an ad agency exec was a guest speaker in one of her classes Young boldly walked to the front of the lecture hall and asked him for an internship. She ended up developing an internship program for the firm making herself the first participant. That led to a copywriting job with the agency after she was finished with school.

Young’s real interest though was in long-form writing and brand development. So two years later she joined Edelman where she worked on the Texas Instruments account. “Terri West who recently retired from TI is now the chair of the UNT Mayborn School of Journalism board of advisors and I’m her chair-elect” Young says. “It’s a full-circle moment. She literally was my first client.”

From Edelman Young launched the Dallas office of GTT Communications discovering a talent for business development due to the agency’s “eat what you kill” business model. In shorter order she became a partner in the firm after hitting certain sales goals. A year later Edelman bought GTT. She used her cut of the proceeds from the sale to launch Marketwave in 1998.

“I knew it was my shot having the capital to go ahead and open the doors” Young says. “There were things I had seen at other people’s agencies that I thought I could do differently—better—with the right team.” The firm’s services are built around brand strategy public relations and employee engagement. And today 24 years later what began as a one-woman shop now has 13 employees and a client roster that includes Oncor Pacific Builders Endeavor Energy Resources and Ulterra.

An early disciple of the conscious capitalism movement (Young helped found the Conscious Capitalism Dallas chapter) she leads her company by focusing on the philosophy’s four core tenets: purpose stakeholder culture and leadership. It’s also the core of a relatively new service offering—helping companies look not only at their external branding but their internal branding too.

“On the external side I’ve always done something called customer journey mapping where you look for communication points and opportunities to market” Young says. “Well there’s also employee mapping. It starts with recruiting then hiring and onboarding—and a lot of companies stop there. But if you don’t have important touch points beyond that your retention won’t be good.”

There’s a strong business case for paying close attention to internal communications she says especially given current labor market conditions. “There’s incredible data around the cost of losing a good employee” Young says. “If you can prevent some of that and if you can help someone see a path at your company long-term you win.”"

WASHINGTON — As the Pentagon increasingly focuses on the primacy of battlefield information through its Joint All Domain Command and Control efforts the Marine Corps’ quest for a new reconnaissance vehicle is focused not just on traditional battlefield intelligence gathering but the ability to ingest and process data from across the joint force.

Now after five years of technology demonstrators and other preliminary efforts the service has two companies — General Dynamics Land Systems and Textron Systems — on track to deliver their final versions of the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) to the service for evaluation in December. An announcement declaring a winner is not expected to come until late next year but just last month the companies put prototypes through swim testing to make sure they are ready for the end-of-year deadline executives said.

With a contract worth up to $6.8 billion at stake for the prevailing bid and amid some skepticism of the program from the very top of the Corps Breaking Defense spoke to both vendors to understand what they hope the ARV will bring to the fight and how the new combat vehicle intersects with two emerging Pentagon interests: information warfare and unmanned systems.

“The Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) is imperative to realizing Marine Corps requirements for Fleet Marine Force 2030” the services wrote of the program in its latest budget request to lawmakers. “As part of the portfolio of reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition systems ARV will be a purpose-built combat vehicle system highly mobile on land and water that can sense communicate and fight as the manned hub of a robotic and autonomous systems-enhanced team.”

A Focus On Command And Control And UAVs



The ARV’s core purpose is to replace the Marine Corps’ Light Armored Vehicle fleet a program that has served the Marines since the 1980s and was built by General Dynamics .

The LAV program is scheduled to sundown in the mid-2030s right after the brand new ARV is scheduled to “full operational capability” the Pentagon’s final acquisition milestone signifying the military’s confidence that the ground vehicle is completely tested proven and ready for combat.

The Marine Corps is interested in six variants of the ARV each with unique roles: command control communications and computers-unmanned aerial system (C4/UAS); organic precision fire-mounted; counter UAS; 30mm autocannon and anti-tank guided missile; logistics; and recovery. (Separately the Corps has also put BAE Systems the prime contractor for another program the Amphibious Contract Vehicle under contract to study how the C4/UAS package used on the ACV could be equipped on the ARV.)

Perhaps in a sign of its importance to the Corps the ARV competition winner will be determined by which company the Marines choose based on the C4/UAS variant of the vehicle. Later the service will work with the winning firm to make the other five variants.

The Marines refer to the C4/UAS variant as the “battlefield quarterback” because the intent is to have an ARV capable of ingesting the massive amounts of data that will be moving across Pentagon and Marine Corps networks as well as help Marines make decisions in the moment based on the information they receive.

Two Teams With Deep Histories In The Pentagon Abroad

Phil Skuta a General Dynamics executive overseeing the company’s ARV bid said the core difference between the ARV’s predecessor the LAV and ARV is the ability to ingest data.

“You basically have 40-year-old technology” he said of the LAV. You don’t have “operational awareness really beyond line of sight… Here we’re talking about a true expansion of being able to sense and detect the enemy on the battlefield tens of miles outside” the ARV’s line of sight.

That focus on ingesting analyzing and allowing Marines to act on data from throughout the battlefield is core to the Pentagon’s JADC2 efforts and more specifically the Navy’s branch of it routinely called Project Overmatch.

Navy officials have been tight lipped about what exactly their Overmatch efforts include — the program’s chief said that silence is meant to keep adversaries guessing — but the notion behind Overmatch revolves around sharing data from platform to platform. The earliest iterations of the technology were scheduled to be put on some aircraft carriers late this year.

One way the Marines hope to feed ARV data about what is going on around it is an unmanned aerial system capable of being deployed potentially as far as 30 miles away from the vehicle. A focus for the competition the executives said was gaining a clear grasp on how that drone will integrate with the ARV.

“Understanding how that flight will take place and then bringing that data back into the ARV and turning that data into useful information to base — whether it’s your reconnaissance decision or other decisions off of [it] is what we mean by integrating the unmanned aerial system capability” Skuta said.

In General Dynamics’ favor in this competition is their history with the program. The company is effectively the incumbent as the makers of the LAV and has taken part in technology demonstrators since 2019. The company is also coming into this competition having recently picked up a separate $1.14 billion Army contract for the Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle.

“ARV [has] to be small mobile survivable platform that can operate in multiple areas of the globe and especially in those littoral areas [and] coastlines as the Marines have staked a lot of their future concepts in the Indo-Pacific region” Skuta said. “We think our vehicle is suited optimally for those type of tactical areas to be operating in.”

Despite the history Skuta said their ARV candidate is a “clean sheet” design meaning it was created from scratch.

Likewise Textron senior executive for land and sea systems David Phillips told Breaking Defense their offering called the Cottonmouth was a “clean sheet” design despite that company having other Army contracts as well.

During an interview Phillips stressed that Cottonmouth is not derived from the company’s M117 Armored Security Vehicle which has been bought by the US Army as well as international customers nor the Commando vehicle a variant of the M117.

He also said the combination of C4 and unmanned systems integration makes this first variant of the ARV particularly complex. But naturally he added his company’s bid was made with the Marines’ needs in mind.

“Where we believe Textron Systems coming with a clean sheet design on this thing really brings value to the Marines is we’ve got a very unique background and history in both ground combat vehicle development and manufacturing but also in systems integration… in multiple domains across” manned and unmanned systems he said.

In addition to the M117 and Commando vehicles Textron is also responsible for the Shadow and Aerosonde unmanned aerial systems both of which are used by the Pentagon and the Marine Corps’ new Ship-to-Shore Connectors medium-sized vessels designed to transport Marines and their equipment from deep blue water ships through shallow waters and ultimately onto land. The familiarity with the latter is important because a key requirement for the new ARV is to be a weight and size that allows four of them to be transported on one Ship-to-Shore Connector.

“We wanted to … make sure that from a durability and really reliability standpoint we were building a solid vehicle and certainly from [a] size and transportability [perspective] keeping really mindful of four systems on a Ship-to-Shore connector” he said. “We know how important that is for the Marines in transporting things through the littoral and onto the shore.”

That familiarity with the Ship-to-Shore Connector’s capabilities combined with the company’s wider portfolio of unmanned systems integration is sure to play to its favor in the final bid.

A Skeptical Eye On The Program From The Top

Once both bids are submitted to the Marines in December the service plans on announcing a winner around fall of 2023. If all goes according to plan — not something that is ever surefire in the world of Pentagon acquisition — the next Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle will be ready for real world operations around 2030.

The service has deemed the ARV as “critical towards the modernization of Marine Corps reconnaissance capability” according to the Navy’s fiscal 2023 budget justification documents. But like every other major acquisition program in the Pentagon not everyone is fully convinced. In this case the skepticism is from the Marine Corps’ top officer.

“While I have repeatedly stated that all-domain reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance will be a critical element of any future contingency I remain unconvinced that additional wheeled manned armored ground reconnaissance units are the best and only answer – especially in the Indo-Pacific region” Commandant Gen. David Berger wrote in his initial Force Design 2030 rollout. “We need to see more evidence during Phase III to support this conclusion before engaging in an expansion of our existing capacity or committing billions of dollars in procurement funds towards the acquisition of an Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV).”

With that in mind the general has since directed in his May 2022 update to Force Design that the Marine Corps “review and validate all assumptions” regarding the ARV. In other words Berger wants the service to consider the changing winds at the Pentagon and make certain this program is still going to produce a product worthy to fight in 2030.

Despite Berger’s comments though the ARV program is still rolling along and for the competition’s winner it will be an opportunity to solidify its place in the Marine Corps’ future ground vehicles portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9sYW5kLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvcmhlaW5tZXRhbGwtYW5kdXJpbC1qb2luLWZvcmNlcy1vbi1vcHRpb25hbGx5LW1hbm5lZC1maWdodGluZy12ZWhpY2xlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rheinmetall Anduril join forces on optionally manned fighting vehicle,"WASHINGTON — American Rheinmetall Vehicles and venture-backed defense technology company Anduril Industries are joining forces in a “strategic partnership” to compete in the U.S. Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle design program according to a Sept. 6 joint statement from the companies.

The Army opened up the competition to design and build prototypes for the replacement of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle releasing a request for proposals to industry this summer.

Last year the Army awarded contracts to five teams to develop preliminary designs; American Rheinmetall was among them. The other four teams are Point Blank Enterprises Oshkosh Defense BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems.

“The partnership with Anduril brings with it exceptional innovations in software development command and control sensor integration and counter-[unmanned aircraft systems] for inclusion in our OMFV offering” Matt Warnick American Rheinmetall’s managing director said in the statement.

Other companies in the Rheinmetall-led industry team include Textron Systems Raytheon Technologies L3Harris Technologies and Allison Transmission; all together they are known as Team Lynx a nod to Rheinmetall’s vehicle that was the company’s planned original bid sample in the Army’s earlier attempt to hold a competition. That effort ended in the fall of 2019 when only General Dynamics Land Systems was able to deliver a physical bid sample to the Army by deadline. Rheinmetall based in Germany ran into issues delivering the Lynx and had to drop out of the competition.

With only one bid sample the Army decided to scrap the competition and reworked its strategy in a lengthier five-phase effort that begins with an initial design phase then moves into a detailed design phase followed by prototyping testing and production.

The founder of virtual reality maker Oculus Palmer Luckey created Anduril. Its co-founders are CEO Brian Schimpf Chief Operations Officer Matt Grimm Joe Chen and Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. Peter Thiel ― who leads Founders Fund with Silicon Valley investors Ken Howery and Brian Singerman ― created data analytics company Palantir which has since achieved a foothold in the defense sector.

Last year Anduril acquired Area-I which has made its mark in the Army aviation development community for its Altius unmanned system used in several major Army air-launched effects demonstrations and experiments to assess future capabilities that could be aboard future vertical lift aircraft.

“Software is at the core of the weapons and military systems of the future” Zach Mears head of strategy at Anduril said in the statement.

The company plans to “leverage our deep experience in artificial intelligence mission autonomy and sensor integration to significantly reduce the cognitive burden of the OMFV’s two soldier crew and provide them with next-generation tactical awareness C2 and decisive lethality to dominate future battlefields” Mears added.

The Army will select up to three teams to participate in the detailed design phase followed by a prototyping phase. Written proposals are due by the end of October.

The detailed design phase will take place in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 and the prototyping phase will begin in 2025. The Army plans to choose three teams in the third quarter of FY23 to build up to 11 prototype vehicles two ballistic hulls and turrets and armor coupons as well as to provide digital engineering data the service said.

The Army expects to select in the fourth quarter of 2027 one company to build low-rate production vehicles. Equipping of the first unit is planned for FY29 and full-rate production is expected to begin in 2030.

Oganessyan and colleagues provided solid evidence on one hand for the presence of PE bound to EPCR through a high-resolution crystal structure and on the other hand for the relevance of the bound lipid in EPCR’s functions as removal of the lipid fraction led to loss of its ability to bind APC23. A later work expanded these results showing first the predominant presence of PC in the lipid cargo of EPCR second the ability for lipid exchange and third the lipid-dependent APC activation and antiapoptotic properties of EPCR24. Of note EPCR has also been associated with autoimmune disease. In particular with coagulopathies linked to the antiphospholipid syndrome2021 and on a different ground with ulcerative colitis22. These studies indicate that EPCR is an autoantigen capable of recruiting autoantibodies which could ultimately contribute to the onset and course of inflammatory response in autoimmune disease. Moreover a recent study reports that a well-defined lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid present in the endosomal compartment of monocytes loads into EPCR and triggers binding of antiphospholipid antibodies on the cell surface21. Given these precedents a deep understanding on the classes of lipids that EPCR can bind is therefore of interest. We previously investigated the lipid content via thin layer chromatography24. This technique combined with staining of organic molecules with phosphomolybdic acid allowed us detect the most populated lipids in EPCR samples: PC and PE. Phosphomolybdic acid is a widely used chemical for detection and visualization of a large variety of organic compounds including phospholipids. However the identification of other compounds present in less abundant quantities might be compromised. To deepen into the lipids that conform the EPCR lipidome and which could be in lower quantities we undertook a mass spectrometry approach. In agreement with previous results the most abundant lipids found where PC and PE. These are represented by species containing varied acyl chain lengths and unsaturations. The presence of a phospholipid molecule is consistent with previous results23 via X-ray crystallography where the structural analyses provide documented evidence for a phospholipid molecule bound to EPCR. The exact nature of this molecule becomes evident in the structure of EPCR complexed with the Gla domain of protein C (PDB accession code 1LQV). On the other hand the structure of EPCR without the PC Gla domain (PDB accession code 1L8J) shows ambiguous electron density at the lipid polar region whereby the head group of the phospholipid could not be accurately determined. This suggests that the EPCR protein co-crystallized with a non-homogeneous phospholipid molecule bound in the groove. Later studies confirmed the presence of PE but also PC in the organic fraction released from EPCR24 providing the first evidences of EPCR lipid heterogeneity.

Remarkably apart from the major phospholipid content we also identified other lipids not previously associated with EPCR. These are phosphatidylserine (PS) phosphatidylinositol (PI) and surprisingly sphingomyelin and ceramides.

PS is found primarily in human brain tissues and importantly in the inner leaflet of cell membranes33. Exposure of PS upon cell injury provides and anchoring platform for various coagulation factors a mechanism widely accepted to favor a procoagulant setting. Consequently binding of PS to EPCR on the endothelial lining might associate with a novel mechanism linking PS with a prothrombotic setting.

As for PI it can represent up to 10% of the phospholipid moiety in brain tissue although it is less abundant in the membranes of eukaryotic cells34. Contrary to other phospholipids PI has a unique structural motif as it carries a myoinositol sugar group covalently linked to the lipid head. Myoinositol is a cyclic carbohydrate that differs from other phospholipids head groups in both the volume and number of functional (-OH) groups. Like myoinositol other cyclic carbohydrates in the form of galactose and glucose are often linked to reactive CD1d-restricted NKT-cells which can recognize and respond to lipids carrying a sugar moiety26. CD1d also binds PI and has been proposed to trigger self-reactivity35. In an analogous manner it is tempting to speculate that this structural motif could trigger a lipid-restricted recognition of EPCR by proteins of the immune system such as TCRs or antibodies.

EPCR properties are lipid-dependent. For instance as described above the presence of bound diacyl phosphoethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine is key for engagement of protein C/APC with EPCR. This is elegantly demonstrated by Oganessyan and coworkers with the 1.60 Å crystal structure of the Gla domain of protein C targeting EPCR23. The electron density of this complex shows excellent and unambiguous signal for PE which defines with high accuracy the polar head group and the length of the acyl chains. In this structure (PDB 1LQV) it can be observed that Arg156 adopts a specific and rigid conformation through interactions with PE phosphate group. This interaction frees up space for the creation of a hydrophobic pocket that enables fitting of the protein C Gla Phe4 residue and consequently docking of the protein C on EPCR (Supplementary Fig. 4). In the delipidated EPCR structure the electron density for the Arg156 side chain is absent which suggests high flexibility (elevated B-factors) and conformational disorder. Thus the absence of a locked phosphate lipid head favors a loose Arg156 conformation that might likely hinder formation of the Phe4 pocket and proper interaction with protein C as previously reported for delipidated EPCR2324.

These observations that EPCR binders such as protein C/APC may bind preferentially to certain EPCR-lipid complexes. Moreover and in line with the lipid dependency of EPCR surface plasmon resonance studies showed that loading of delipidated EPCR whose interaction with protein C/APC is compromised with PC restored its binding ability24. Up to date several structural and binding studies have documented the binding of EPCR binders near the lipid pocket. These ligands are protein C and factor VII in both their zymogen and activated forms363738 and the CIDRα domains39 found in the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1) family of proteins. A recent study also suggests engagement of EPCR by antibodies on or near the lipid binding site21.

Although the binding cleft in EPCR is slightly wider than that of CD1d both proteins present cavities that are hydrophobic in nature and this chemical environment favors interactions with non-polar lipid tails in the A’ and F’ pockets as defined for CD1d. We have seen that the most abundant species bound to EPCR carry lipid tails that are no longer than 22 carbons. Unlike CD1d that can host lipids as long as 26 carbons in the A' pocket as it is the case of alpha-galactosylceramide4041 for instance we did not find lipids with tails larger than 22 carbons in the lipid load of EPCR. A reasonable basis for this discrepancy can be found in the structural differences in the A' pocket of EPCR with respect to that of CD1d. The presence of bulkier Met13 and Phe164 in EPCR's groove near the edge of the phospholipid tail in the A' pocket as opposed to Cys and Leu in CD1d may confer a more severe restriction. In this line the frequency of 22 and 24-carbon long lipids in CD1d is higher42. However and similar to CD1d we found that acyl chains of 18 carbons in both the sn-1 and sn-2 tails dominate the EPCR lipid sample. Although in a lower extent we could also detect species with 16-carbon long acyl chains in the family of lysophospholipids diacyl-phospholipids and sphingomyelins. Other minor species present shorter chains like 14-carbon long ceramides or longer as detected for some ceramides (22 carbon in sn-2). Interestingly in the lysophospholipid group we could only detect 18-carbon long species in either sn-1 or sn-2. Nevertheless as for CD1d42 phospholipid species represent a major component of the EPCR lipid signature.

We also analyzed the extent of unsaturations. Most sn-1 chains had either 0 or 1 double bond but higher degrees of unsaturations were detected in some species presenting up to 6 double bonds. Interestingly unlike CD1d42 that yields lipids with up to 6 unsaturations in sn-2 EPCR shows a much lower complexity whereby 1 double bond is the most prevalent unsaturation and lipids with more than 2 unsaturations are not detected. The fact that the source (cell lines) were these two proteins were produced are different could contribute to these discrepancies. CD1d was expressed in a human B cell line while EPCR has produced in Spodoptera frugiperda sf9 cells.

Of particular interest is the identification of ceramides and sphingomyelin. These are structurally related with other sphingolipids such as hexosylceramides or lactosylceramides among other types of lipids. Despite the presence of this class of molecules we did not find glycolipids with sugar groups conjugated to ceramide backbones. The lack of such species could denote a structural restriction in EPCR caused by bulky sugar groups incompatible with fitting into EPCR’s binding pocket. However the detection of inositol-containing phospholipids in the EPCR lipidome does support this possibility. In this line in a previous report Marheineke K. et al.43 analyzed the lipid content in sf9 cells the cell type where we produce our recombinant EPCR and could not detect glycolipid species. Thus an alternative reason for the absence of glycolipids in the EPCR lipidome is the lack of a source for this specific lipid class. Likewise we did not detect phosphatidic acid in our samples but the presence of this molecule was not reported either in the sf9-derived lipid pool.

To explore the content of the cavity through a different approach we carried out an extensive screening of crystallization conditions for EPCR. We obtained crystals in varied conditions and determined the structure of EPCR in three different space groups which enabled a wider sampling of the EPCR-lipid complexes. In all cases and in agreement with the mass spectrometry results and previous crystallographic data234445 we observe a predominant phospholipid scaffold in all EPCR structures regardless of the space group. Yet the precise identity of the outermost fraction bound to the phosphate is ambiguous which supports the presence of a heterogeneous phospholipid population bound to EPCR.

Analysis of the ADPs revealed a tendency to higher mobility in the lipid region proximal to the groove opening i.e. the polar head group. This was expected as the buried fatty acids are embedded inside a hydrophobic core and likely tightly gripped to the receptor. The polar region is in a more solvent-exposed and less locked scenario hence the higher static disorder.

As for the morphology of the cavity it resembles in all cases that of the MHC class I-like CD1 family of receptors with two major A’ and F’ pockets that provide room for binding of fatty acids. Additional space is found beyond these pockets in some but not all EPCR structures. However these smaller cavities are surrounded by polar residues and therefore their chemistry is not optimal for accommodation of hydrophobic acyl chains. Further the lack of electron density signal for side chains in the cavity suggest structural plasticity or disorder i.e. the morphology of EPCR’s cavity is not absolutely rigid. Whether these additional pockets could play a role in EPCR’s functions requires further investigation.

In conclusion we provide a comprehensive analysis of the lipids found in EPCR. Although with different abundances EPCR hosts lipids of varied classes. Given the impact that well-defined lipids have on EPCR including relevant roles in coagulation disorders and autoimmune disease these findings accentuate the need to investigate the lipid-dependent properties of EPCR and their potential links with disease.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWEuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjIvQW1lcmljYW4tQWlybGluZXMtTmFtZXMtVmljZW50ZS1SZXluYWwtdG8taXRzLUJvYXJkLW9mLURpcmVjdG9ycy1DT1JQLUVYRUMtMDkvZGVmYXVsdC5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Names Vicente Reynal to its Board of Directors,"FORT WORTH Texas – American Airlines Group Inc.

A new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences uses modeling and aerodynamics to describe how gulls can change the shape of their wings to control their response to gusts or other disturbances. The lessons could one day apply to uncrewed aerial vehicles or other flying machines.

“Birds easily perform challenging maneuvers and they’re adaptable so what exactly about their flight is most useful to implement in future aircraft?” said Christina Harvey assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California Davis and lead author on the paper.

Harvey began studying gulls as a master’s student in zoology at the University of British Columbia after earning her bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering.

“Gulls are very common and easy to find and they’re really impressive gliders” she said.

Harvey continued her work on gulls as a doctoral student at the University of Michigan. She recently joined the faculty at UC Davis after completing her PhD in aerospace engineering.

In March this year Harvey and colleagues at the University of Michigan published a paper in Nature analyzing the flight dynamics of 22 bird species. While previous studies have tended to focus on aerodynamics—how air moves around a bird—Harvey developed equations to describe birds’ inertial properties such as the center of gravity and the neutral point where aerodynamic forces can be consistently modeled as point forces.

Aircraft are typically designed to be stable or unstable. A stable aircraft will tend to return back to steady flight when perturbed (for example getting pushed up by a wind gust). This is desirable for example in an airliner but not for a jet fighter. Highly maneuverable aircraft are designed to be unstable.

In their Nature paper Harvey and colleagues showed that almost all the bird species studied are capable of both stable and unstable flight and use wing movements to shift between these modes.

Controllable flight

The new study builds on this work bringing together aerodynamic studies using 3-D printed models of gulls and gull wings in a wind tunnel with computer modeling of inertial forces to understand how gulls achieve stability along their long axis (falling or rising).

Gulls can adjust how they respond to perturbations in that axis by adjusting their wrist and elbow joints and morphing the shape of the wings they found. The team was able to predict the gulls’ flying qualities and how rapidly they can recover from a perturbation like a gust. That reaction time also gives insights into the “controllable range” for the bird and into applying bird flight dynamics to aircraft.

“The flight qualities analysis asks: if you built an aircraft exactly like a gull would a human be able to fly it?” Harvey said.

As uncrewed aerial vehicles or drones become more widely used they need to be able to navigate complex urban environments something birds do very well. A deeper understanding of bird flight could help improve drone designs for various uses.

Harvey will be opening her lab at UC Davis this fall. She hopes to collaborate with other campus researchers including the California Raptor Center and researchers working on insect flight at the College of Biological Sciences.

“There are so many open questions about bird flight” she said “I’m looking forward to seeing what else is out there to discover.”

Coauthor on the paper is Daniel Inman University of Michigan. Harvey’s work is partly supported by grants from the U. S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation.

These are the best hiking spots in New Jersey A trip to New Jersey doesn't have to be all about the beach. Our state has some incredible trails waterfalls and lakes to enjoy.

From the Pine Barrens to the Appalachian Trail to the hidden gems of New Jersey you have plenty of options for a great hike. Hiking is such a great way to spend time outdoors and enjoy nature plus it's a great workout.

Before you go out on the trails and explore some of our listeners' suggestions I have some tips on hiking etiquette from the American Hiking Society.

If you are going downhill and run into an uphill hiker step to the side and give the uphill hiker space. A hiker going uphill has the right of way unless they stop to catch their breath.

Always stay on the trail you may see side paths unless they are marked as an official trail steer clear of them. By going off-trail you may cause damage to the ecosystems around the trail the plants and wildlife that live there.

You also do not want to disturb the wildlife you encounter just keep your distance from the wildlife and continue hiking.

Bicyclists should yield to hikers and horses. Hikers should also yield to horses but I’m not sure how many horses you will encounter on the trails in New Jersey. If you are thinking of bringing your dog on your hike they should be leashed and make sure to clean up all pet waste.

Lastly be mindful of the weather if the trail is too muddy it's probably best to save your hike for another day.

I asked our listeners for their suggestions of the best hiking spots in New Jersey check out their suggestions:

The restaurant is located at 6677 Manlius Center Road in East Syracuse between the Tractor Supply store and the DeWitt Home Design Center.

“We hope to be here for years to come” said Enio Agüero who runs Mi Rancho with his wife Mirna. “For that our goal is to make an impact and make it a fun place and a family place.”

In response to someone who informed the Kirkville couple that the business was the seventh to occupy that space in their recent memory Enio said he told them that seven is a lucky number.

The Mi Rancho menu includes burritos carnitas fajitas nachos and hot tamales among other meals.

Enio said that although he and his wife are not the first to bring Mexican cuisine to the village they are excited to introduce their own uniquely flavored dishes to that side of town.

“We don’t see it as a competition with anybody else” he said. “It’s just another way to provide a good place to eat.”

Mirna said it had been stressful and time-consuming to ready the restaurant but worthwhile.

Calling the opportunity to open “a dream come true” regardless of the hard work that comes with it Enio said he wants the business to generate connections with new friends who can share in its anticipated success.

The couple expressed gratitude at the Sept. 1 grand opening for the divine influence in their lives and the people who encouraged their idea to start a restaurant even if was just the simple wish of “good luck.”

“Whatever God gives us we have to be responsible for” said Enio a chaplain with the Air National Guard sector based in Rome New York. “If we stay by God’s side we will succeed.”

At the event Enio led those gathered in a dedicatory prayer spoken in both English and Spanish. He asked for the restaurant to prosper and become a place of gathering for the community.

“As we say in Spanish mi casa es su casa—my house is your house” he said to the attendees before inviting them back inside. “Make it your house.”

On behalf of the East Syracuse Village Board Mayor Lorene Dadey handed a written-out welcome message to the Agüeros during the ceremony.

“We are very grateful and thankful that you have come here” Dadey said. “You have a beautiful place.”

For now Mi Rancho Mexican Restaurant will be open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day of the week but that schedule may be adjusted as needed Enio said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGZvb2Rwcm9jZXNzaW5nLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNjE0OC1zdGV3YXJ0LXJldmFtcHMtZG9nLXRyZWF0LWxpbmUtd2l0aC1uZXctZm9ybXVsYXMtcGFja2FnZS1kZXNpZ25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stewart revamps dog treat line with new formulas package designs,"DAYTON OHIO — Stewart an all-natural premium pet food and treat brand owned by BrightPet Nutrition Group announced Aug. 23 the launch of several new freeze-dried treat products.

Special to Cape Cod Times

BUZZARDS BAY — The list of lingering problems at the Bourne Veteran's Memorial Community Center remains a long one but there is new determination by building trustees and Town Administrator Marlene McCollem to review what needs to be fixed and create priorities.

The intergenerational center on Main Street opened two decades ago. Problems include clogged toilet lines leading to the new sewer system security cameras not hooked up to the police station heating/ventilation/air conditioning uneven in distribution throughout the building and gym doors that leaked and when fixed were unable to be opened.

In an Aug. 30 discussion with the Trustees of the Veterans Memorial Community Center McCollem promised collaboration and responsiveness when trustee issues are sent to her office. She said issues relating to the building staff and scheduling of center activities are not within the trustees’ domain. For facility issues she requested a list of problems and issues that need resolution.

“What are your priorities?” McCollem said. “Put them in a list and we’ll put it in a plan and (possibly) take it to capital outlay (committee) review.”

Some problems seem critical some nagging and some prompted questions. Such as why spend money on the Center Café when it is not to be used for meals preparation?

More costly work may need town meeting OK

So trustees will compile lists compile ideas and review them in late October. More costly items will have to be put over to capital outlay review this winter and possibly placed the annual Town Meeting warrant in May if they cost $20000 or more. If approved they might be undertaken in fiscal 2024.

HVAC may be the costliest item. Selectmen Chair Peter Meier liaison to building trustees asked McCollem to consider asking Trane Technologies consultants to review HVAC issues and update the board.

There are subsidiary issues that involve complaints about both a regional parochial and an area charter school scheduling gym space in the center something that arguably impacts the facility being used by local youngsters.

The trustees also need to know where HVAC questions should be directed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWRzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RlZC1zc2wtY29udHJvbHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDI4MjM2MC9pbmR1c3RyeS1wYXJ0bmVycy1sZWFkLXRoZS13YXktdG8tYmV0dGVyLWJ1aWxkaW5ncy12aWEtaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1saWdodGluZy1hbmQtY29udHJvbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Industry partners lead the way to better buildings via integrated lighting and controls,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ledsmagazine.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /connected-ssl-controls/article/14282360/industry-partners-lead-the-way-to-better-buildings-via-integrated-lighting-and-controls (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671101C190>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWRzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RlZC1zc2wtY29udHJvbHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDI4MjM2MC9pbmR1c3RyeS1wYXJ0bmVycy1sZWFkLXRoZS13YXktdG8tYmV0dGVyLWJ1aWxkaW5ncy12aWEtaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1saWdodGluZy1hbmQtY29udHJvbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9ob3VzZS1ydW5zLTEwMC1vbi1kYy1wb3dlci1wdXJkdWUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9ob3VzZS1ydW5zLTEwMC1vbi1kYy1wb3dlci1wdXJkdWUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1wcm9qZWN0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House Runs 100% on DC Power — Purdue University Project,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9ob3VzZS1ydW5zLTEwMC1vbi1kYy1wb3dlci1wdXJkdWUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9ob3VzZS1ydW5zLTEwMC1vbi1kYy1wb3dlci1wdXJkdWUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1wcm9qZWN0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671101F460>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9ob3VzZS1ydW5zLTEwMC1vbi1kYy1wb3dlci1wdXJkdWUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9ob3VzZS1ydW5zLTEwMC1vbi1kYy1wb3dlci1wdXJkdWUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1wcm9qZWN0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

The last two years were difficult for all of us. But as we take a collective breath on the other side of the pandemic and ruminate on the positive takeaways from that time many of us will settle on the same sentiment – sometimes it’s good to slow down. Our lives which are so often defined by constant motion suddenly came to a halt a change of pace that many of us would never have chosen or stumbled upon organically.

As social calendars were cleared of activities travel plans were postponed and work obligations came home with us for the foreseeable future we had a unique opportunity to pause and look inward taking inventory of our lives and habits in a reflective fashion. For many this inspired a shift in priorities – from work to our daily routines relationships and more. But for those of us with a relentless appetite for travel or those of us (like myself) who work within the travel and hospitality sector the pandemic also prompted an undeniable industry shift towards a more sustainable future.

With more time to consider our impact on the world we live in discussions surrounding the rise of ecotourism and sustainability have now reached a fever pitch. Before the pandemic these trends had been set in motion but now? They’ve reached center stage and travel and hospitality brands can no longer afford to skirt their responsibility to the planet if they hope to remain aligned with consumer concerns and preferences.

The Call for A Responsible Return to Travel

In a 2022 survey conducted by The Vacationer more than 87% of American adults said sustainable travel is either somewhat important or very important to them. The 87.32% represents nearly 225 million people based on the current census. Notably a Booking.com study conducted in 2016 showed only 62% of global travelers were interested in sustainable travel which leads me to believe that the pandemic was perhaps a global wake-up call for our industry. In fact 51% of travelers in a recent study said that the pandemic made them want to travel more sustainably in the future. Moreover over the past year almost 60% of travelers said the beauty of nature was what inspired them to think about the environment and the grueling effects their trip may have had on the environment. Finally Booking.com’s annual Sustainable Travel Report (which gathered insights from over 30000 travelers across 32 countries and territories) revealed that travelers are selecting planet-first options and looking to brands for sustainable choices and more purposeful travel.

This collective shift in perspective is if anything long overdue. While tourism is the economic lifeblood of many destinations around the world it also takes a physical toll on those nations – both literally and with respect to the erosion or displacement of locals and their respective culture. Back in 2018 a survey found that tourism is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In her recent book Go Lightly travel writer Nina Karnikowski notes that during the lockdown global carbon emissions decreased by as much as 17% (the lowest level in 14 years). “Once our devastation about the loss of lives and livelihoods abated we realized the pandemic could show us a cleaner slower and more conscious travel world” she wrote.

Now as the travel and hospitality industry once again finds its stride we face a new challenge: how can we balance our renewed appetite for travel with consideration for the destinations we hope to visit and the world at large? To this effect The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has now called for a ""responsible recovery of the tourism sector"" to ""balance the needs of people the planet and prosperity.""

Greenwashing - The Hidden Truth

Greenwashing is best described as a form of advertising or marketing in which green initiatives or promises are used deceptively to persuade the public that an organization's products aims and policies are environmentally friendly. In a recent Washington Post article author Christopher Elliott pointed out that greenwashing runs rampant in the travel industry specifically. “Many travel companies relaxed their sustainability efforts during the pandemic adding sanitizing programs that increased the use of disposable or non-recyclable materials” he wrote. “Even today everything seems to be wrapped in plastic.”

Joshua Zinder a managing partner of JZA+D who was also quoted in the article noted that greenwashing is not always easy to spot even for eco-conscious travelers eager to vacation responsibly. “We’ve all seen those little cards in the bathrooms in guest rooms suggesting that you may decline to have housekeeping provide clean towels” shared Zinder. “Who really benefits from this practice? The hotel operator does of course since they stand to save on the energy water and human resource utilization related to laundry. This is a cost-saving strategy with little impact on the environment.”

According to a new study in the Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management greenwashing practices combined with corporate social responsibility claims have reduced the trust of U.S. consumers who increasingly recognize hotels’ green claims may be self-serving. Any hotelier knows that the trust of guests is integral to a hotel brands’ success and to this effect research shows a majority of travelers are willing to boycott a company if misled. Greenwashing isn’t just a corrupt manipulation of travelers’ good intent – it’s bad business that will cost hotels their reputation and negatively impact their bottom line.

A Truly Greener Future

As it currently stands our industry has not yet established a concrete blueprint to truly eco-conscious standards – and we have our work cut out for us in that department. To get that ball rolling however hotels can establish goodwill with travelers and the world at large by earning certifications from well-known and respected agencies such as Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) and Green Seal.

In addition to certifications hotels should prioritize transparency in their marketing efforts especially with regard to environmental practices and standards. Preach only what you practice and avoid being vague with information that may inform a traveler’s decision to book with your hotel. Hotels can also look to adopt renewable energy abandon the use of single-use plastic advertise incentives for travelers to book during off-peak times implement ‘smart room’ technology that reduces energy consumption and partner with local providers of cultural tours and activities.

Remember 83% of travelers want to decrease their energy consumption 79% want to use more environmentally friendly transportation 76% would like to lower their water usage and 69% want to reduce the carbon footprint of their vacation. The writing is on the wall – sustainable travel is here to stay (as it should be) and the hospitality industry needs to do more to appeal to consumers who want to make a difference. So fellow hospitality leaders how can we band together to establish better standards practices and indicators of sustainable excellence as an industry ecosystem dedicated to doing better for our planet and our travelers?

Americans traveling to Europe can do so a bit more cheaply these days than in recent years. The U.S. dollar is trading at its highest level in roughly two decades relative to the euro — meaning travelers can buy more overseas. That means Americans are effectively getting a discount on hotels car rentals tours and other goods and services denominated in euros. And it's not just the euro — the dollar's value is at its strongest in years relative to many other foreign currencies too according to travel experts. More from Personal Finance:

67% of pandemic 'boomerang kids' are still living with mom and dad It's unclear how long the good times will last. Some may wonder: Should I act now to lock in a favorable exchange rate? ""I'd pull the trigger now"" Aiden Freeborn senior editor at travel site The Broke Backpacker told CNBC. ""You could hedge and wait to see if things improve but that could backfire"" he added. ""Don't be too greedy; accept the fact this is a very strong position."" Here's what to know and how to take advantage.

Americans are getting a 16% discount

Just how much of a discount are travelers getting right now? Let's look at the euro as an example. The euro is the official currency for 19 of the 27 European Union members: Austria Belgium Cyprus Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malta the Netherlands Portugal Slovakia Slovenia and Spain. The euro has been falling in value relative to the U.S. dollar for more than a year. It hit parity with the U.S. dollar on July 13 — the first time since 2002 — meaning the two currencies had a 1:1 exchange rate. Since then the euro has dropped further. One U.S. dollar bought nearly 1.01 euros as of the market close Monday. Americans are getting a roughly 16% discount from a year ago. ""The exchange rate right now is ridiculous"" Charlie Leocha chairman of Travelers United an advocacy group has told CNBC. ""It makes everything in Europe that used to be expensive not that expensive.""

But the dollar's strength is broader than just the euro. For example the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index gauges the dollar's appreciation relative to currencies of the U.S.' main trading partners like the Canadian dollar British pound Mexican peso and Japanese yen in addition to the euro. It's up more than 8% in the last year. Further since July the index has hovered near its highest point dating to at least 1973 according to Andrew Hunter senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. There's one exception: the period from March to May 2020 when international travel was largely inaccessible due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ""I think the big picture is now is probably a good time to go abroad"" Hunter said. ""Now is a good time to buy foreign currency basically.""

Why the U.S. dollar is stronger

Matteo Colombo | Moment | Getty Images

The strength of the dollar is attributable to a few factors Hunter said. Perhaps the most consequential is the U.S. Federal Reserve's campaign to raise interest rates. The central bank has been more aggressive than others around the world in increasing borrowing costs; the dynamic creates an incentive for international investors to keep funds in dollar-based assets since they can generally earn a higher return Hunter said. Recently soaring natural gas prices have contributed to an ""increasingly bleak"" economic outlook in Europe Hunter said. Meanwhile natural gas prices have been broadly stable in the U.S. where the main trend is instead the continued sharp fall in gasoline prices he added. Earlier this year surging oil prices had hurt growth prospects for some developed countries (especially in Europe) relative to the U.S. And economic uncertainty (due to factors like inflation and recession fears and the war in Ukraine) has led investors to flock to safe haven assets like the U.S. dollar.

""Further gains in the dollar if they materialize are still likely to be relatively small compared to the rise we've already seen"" Hunter said. ""But there's maybe a bit more scope for further dollar appreciation now than we previously thought."" Of course currency moves are notoriously difficult to predict he said. The European Central Bank also increased interest rates in July for the first time in 11 years. So far that doesn't seem to have impacted the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro Freeborn said. ""But it does signal that the ECB is now taking action"" he said. ""As such it may only be a matter of time before the euro starts to rise against the dollar — so now really is the time to travel.""

Pay in advance to lock in low exchange rates

Of course this isn't all to say Americans will necessarily reap financial rewards the world over. But tourists planning or considering a trip to a country where the dollar is historically strong can lock in that favorable exchange rate by booking a hotel rental car or other service today instead of deferring the cost according to travel experts. This is especially worthwhile for those with a trip at least three months away Leocha said. ""You can pay in advance and sometimes you get a discount for paying in advance — so you get a discount and the low exchange rate"" he said.

Be aware: In some cases you may owe an additional foreign transaction fee for a credit card purchase overseas. Some travel cards eliminate these fees though which generally amount to 3% of the purchase price Leocha said. Fees may depend on where the company you're transacting with is based. There isn't a foreign transaction fee if the purchase is through a third-party U.S. entity like Expedia but there often is one if booked directly through a foreign entity like the actual hotel Leocha said.

Bilberry which was founded in Paris in 2016 has developed an artificial intelligence platform and camera system that identifies weeds in real-time allowing certain sprayers to be retrofitted with technology to target weeds in a growing crop — commonly referred to as “green-on-green” spraying technology.

While the company’s green-on-green system has been commercialized in Australia Bilberry engineers have been working on bringing the system to the North American market. Testing and data collection took place this spring and summer in Western Canada targeting broadleaf weeds in cereal crops grassy weeds in canola and both broadleaf and grassy weeds in corn (as Bilberry engineer Adrien Persuy discussed on this RealAgriculture Wheat School episode).

For Trimble the acquisition of Bilberry will complement the large tech company’s existing WeedSeeker spraying system which can identify plants on bare soil (green-on-brown) prior to a crop emerging.

“Our planned acquisition of Bilberry builds out Trimble’s crop protection portfolio by adding green-on-green selective spraying capabilities and supports our development of autonomous solutions” said Jim Chambers vice president of Trimble Agriculture in a news release. “The Bilberry solution is brand agnostic and compatible with a broad range of spraying equipment manufacturers which is ideal for mixed fleet operations. This capability together with existing Trimble competencies will enable us to expand our role in the growing market for precision agriculture solutions that can reduce input costs create efficiencies for our customers and drive sustainability in farming.”

Financial terms of the deal were not made public. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Trimble received approval of its emissions reduction targets by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) a coalition of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) the United Nations Global Compact the World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature joining a growing number of companies taking urgent action on climate change.

“Taking decisive climate action is essential to protect our planet and communities for future generations” said Rob Painter president and CEO Trimble. “It also demonstrates Trimble’s commitment to our purpose — to transform the way the world works as well as transform the way ‘we’ work.”

“For decades Trimble solutions have contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change” Painter said. “The nature of Trimble’s technologies which connect the physical and digital worlds provides efficiencies and promotes sustainability in our end markets such as construction agriculture forestry utilities and transportation. Our leadership team is committed to further reducing our carbon footprint as well as continuing to develop solutions that enable our customers to reduce their climate impacts — it is an important lever in our Connect and Scale strategy. Trimble is dedicated to do its part to help protect and build a better world.”

Trimble’s science-based targets accelerate decarbonization across its value chain and include the following commitments:

reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 from a 2019 base year

achieve 100 percent annual sourcing of renewable electricity by 2025

reduce absolute scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from fuel and energy-related activities business travel and upstream transportation and distribution by 50 percent by 2030 from a 2019 base year

commit to partner with 70 percent of its suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services and capital goods to set science-based targets by 2026.

This decade is considered the decisive one for climate change. As part of answering this urgent call to action Trimble has joined forces with other companies and climate leaders in the Business Ambition for 1.5° C campaign the We Mean Business Coalition and the Race to Zero Campaign.

“Setting ambitious yet achievable climate targets is part of our commitment to reducing Trimble’s carbon footprint” said Leah Lambertson senior vice president and head of Sustainability Trimble. “Embedding our climate action goals into Trimble’s operational choices will help ensure that our decision making and growth plans are consistent with our low-carbon vision. Today’s commitments are important steps in our journey to delivering growth in a responsible and sustainable way to achieve a net-zero future.”

Once the deal closes BankDirect Capital Finance will operate as a division of AFCO Credit Corp. Truist Insurance Holdings' premium finance operation in the United States the Charlotte North Carolina-based bank announced Tuesday.

The deal which is expected to close in the fourth quarter includes 122 BankDirect employees five offices including the firm's headquarters near Chicago and $3.1 billion of low-risk variable-rate loans.

The deal would add $3.1 billion of loans to Truist's AFCO Credit business which currently has a loan book of approximately $4 billion.

AFCO is paying approximately $3.4 billion in cash Texas Capital said in a separate press release.

John Howard Truist's chief insurance officer called the deal ""a key acquisition"" for the $545 billion-asset bank.

""We'll extend our business into life insurance a growing market for premium finance as well as broaden our geographic reach particularly on the west coast"" Howard said in a press release.

The sale of BankDirect reflects two opposing business strategies — one centered on regional and national expansion by way of offering a broad range of products and services and the other focused on pulling back in certain areas to focus on specific geographies and markets.

Truist which formed in 2019 with the merger of BB&T and SunTrust Banks is taking the former approach. Texas Capital which is in the midst of a multiyear transformation to increase profitability and become the flagship financial services firm in Texas is using the latter strategy.

For the Dallas-based parent company of Texas Capital Bank the sale ""represents a significant step by management to accelerate the transformation of the bank to a pure play Texas commercial bank from its legacy national strategy"" Casey Haire a Jefferies analyst wrote Tuesday in a research note.

For Truist the BankDirect deal is its latest insurance-related acquisition .

In August Truist Insurance Holdings said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire BenefitMall a benefits wholesale general agency from funds managed by the global investment firm Carlyle. In March it launched a new insurance services division after acquiring Kensington Vanguard National Land Services a national title insurance agency.

The investments are boosting Truist's insurance-related income. In the second quarter of this year such income totaled $825 million up 13% from the prior quarter in part because of the Kensington Vanguard acquisition Truist said in July.

Ken Usdin an analyst at Jefferies said in a research note that insurance premium finance is ""a solid risk-adjusted return business with decent yields [and] spreads a variable-rate nature and very low credit losses.""

He wrote that the deal fits strategically into Truist's existing AFCO business which currently has a loan book of approximately $4 billion.

Commercial banking The turnaround of Texas Capital Bank Under the leadership of new CEO Rob Holmes the Dallas-based company has embarked upon a top-to-bottom transformation to become the ""flagship financial services firm"" of the Lone Star State. But can Holmes make progress quickly enough to satisfy impatient investors? July 26

Texas Capital meanwhile views the sale as an opportunity to increase its capital levels and improve its liquidity position. The $31 billion-asset company expects its common equity Tier 1 ratio to increase by 199 basis points while its loan-to-deposit ratio should decline the bank said in the press release.

In a call Tuesday with analysts to discuss the deal Texas Capital CEO Rob Holmes said the decision to sell BankDirect is aligned with the company's focus on generating more business and deeper relationships with more commercial clients in Texas.

""It was a transaction business if you will"" Holmes said. ""It was really good granular safe loans but that's not consistent with the strategy. It's not a loan-only strategy anymore.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zdXJhbmNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIwOTA2L05FV1MwNi85MTIzNTIyNzAvVHJ1aXN0LWJ1eXMtVGV4YXMtQ2FwaXRhbCVFMiU4MCU5OXMtcHJlbWl1bS1maW5hbmNlLXVuaXQtQmFua0RpcmVjdC1mb3ItJDM0LWJpbGxpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Truist buys Texas Capital’s premium finance unit for $3.4 billion,"(Reuters) – Texas Capital Bancshares Inc. said on Tuesday it had agreed to sell its insurance premium finance unit to Truist Financial Corp. for $3.4 billion in a bid to re-focus on its core businesses and manage expenses.

The unit BankDirect Capital Finance will operate as a division of AFCO Credit Corp. Truist's insurance premium finance business in the United States.

Premium financing refers to the practice of taking out loans to pay insurance premiums.

Dallas-based Texas Capital which is the parent firm of Texas Capital Bank said it would streamline operations and deploy resources to its core businesses.

“The sale of BankDirect represents an important milestone for Texas Capital further enabling us to re-focus our capital and expense base consistent with our strategy of creating the flagship full-service financial services firm in Texas” Texas Capital CEO Rob C. Holmes said in a prepared statement. “The sale follows a deliberate process designed to maximize shareholder value strengthen our balance sheet simplify our business model and free up incremental resources to be redeployed to our core businesses. ”

The all-cash deal represents an 8.5% premium on the divested loan portfolio according to Texas Capital.

Texas Capital said the deal will improve its loan-to-deposit ratio — an important measure of banking financial condition. The company had $21.6 billion in total loans and $25.8 billion in deposits as of March 31 according to the most recent data filed with the Texas Department of Banking. It had total assets of $31 billion making it the state’s 11th-largest bank.

The BankDirect sale is expected to close later this year subject to regulatory approvals.

“At the close of this transaction in the fourth quarter Texas Capital will be better capitalized than it has ever been and with great liquidity a sound strategy ... a very strong loan book” Holmes told analysts in a call to discuss the divestiture. “We are now in the most favorable capital position in the history of our firm.”

Texas Capital’s loans to commercial and industrial businesses this year had grown by $1.5 billion or about 20% “giving effect to this divestiture” Holmes said. The decision roughly coincided with the one-year anniversary of Holmes’ plan to build a Texas-focused full-service financial services firm.

Truist characterized the deal as a strategic investment for the Charlotte N.C.-based company and said BankDirect’s loan portfolio broadens its life insurance business. The loan portfolio includes both property and casualty and life insurance products across a national footprint.

“The addition of BankDirect expands our team further diversifies the risk management solutions we can provide our clients and creates new opportunities to fulfill our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities” Truist chairman and CEO Bill Rogers said in a prepared statement.

BankDirect founded in 2005 and based in Chicago has grown through four acquisitions. Its 122 employees work in five U.S. offices.

“BankDirect brings a strong track record of growth and success in the premium finance business” said Truist chief insurance officer John Howard. “With this acquisition we’ll extend our business into life insurance a growing market for premium finance as well as broaden our geographic reach particularly on the West Coast.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumers and businesses are still in good financial shape despite high inflation and concerns about a looming recession some of the nation's top bankers told a conference in New York on Tuesday.

Brian Moynihan chief executive officer of Bank of America Corp the nation's second-largest bank said customers spent 10% more in August from a year earlier and bank account balances are higher for many than they were pre-pandemic.

""The consumer and businesses are in good shape"" said William Rogers chief executive officer of Truist Financial Corp. ""And the commercial and corporate side businesses have never been in better health. Companies' balance sheets are all really strong.""

The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates as it tries to tame inflation sparking fears the central bank could cause a recession.

U.S. banks stand to benefit from rising interest rates because they can earn more income from charging interest to customers. Still if rate hikes do send the economy into recession that could cut in to banks' profits.

Low unemployment a strong housing market and a revival of the entertainment industry in California reflect a solid economy there said Kelly Coffey CEO of City National Bank a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada.

The combination of COVID-19 government stimulus and a strong job market are still buoying consumer finances said René Jones CEO of M&T Bank.

""When we look at our credit statistics"" such as delinquencies and charge-offs they are ""very much below where we were pre-pandemic and it's going to take a long time to normalize back to where we were.""

That was the sentiment around campus on Tuesday afternoon when the school released the information that Sam Hartman a record-setting junior quarterback is back. He cleared all his medical marks to play again after suffering a blood clot in his left arm a month ago that kept him out of all football-related activities including last week’s win over VMI.

As one student passing through campus said: “Sure we can the ACC title because Sam is back.”

Hartman who has been out since Aug. 9 after undergoing surgery for a blood clot was cleared to play by team doctors. He’s been cleared to practice since Sunday and will start on Saturday at Vanderbilt according to Coach Dave Clawson.

The school revealed little about Hartman’s non-football related injury that led to surgery by Dr. Julie Freischlag a renowned vascular surgeon and also the CEO of Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Dean of Wake Forest University School of Medicine and Chief Academic Officer of Atrium Health.

Freischlag said in a statement: “After our diagnosis on Aug. 9 we first did a procedure to remove the blood clot. Secondly we performed surgery to eliminate the pressure on the vein and then dilated the vein.”

There was then plenty of recovery time in which Hartman had a soft sling on his arm and last Friday it was determined that the clot was gone.

By Sunday he was back on the field practicing and he practiced again on Monday.

Hartman has decided to not discuss his ordeal with journalists and instead focus on Saturday’s noon game at Vanderbilt. He said in a statement he was grateful for Freischlag Dr. Matthew Goldman and Niles Fleet (the head athletic trainer) for guiding him through the process.

“There will be time for me to tell my complete story but right now I am just really excited to get back on the field with my teammates and compete each day to help our team get ready for Vanderbilt this Saturday” Hartman said in a statement.

Clawson and Hartman’s teammates were especially happy to see him back on the practice field but Clawson said it wasn’t just about football.

“It’s about him being healthy again” Clawson said. “Sam attacked this rehabilitation process and it has been really special to see how everyone inside and out of our program supported Sam.”

Teammate Michael Jurgens who has been Hartman’s center for the past three seasons said the team found out at practice on Tuesday morning that Hartman could play.

“There was a big eruption when they said they were making the announcement” Jurgens said. “Sam has put so much work into it and we’re happy to have him.”

Defensive lineman Rondell Bothroyd said the mood of the team was great.

“Everyone is just excited for him but just because he’s healthy and it’s not about the football side of it” Bothroyd said. “He’s one of the best quarterbacks in the country but just the fact that he’s healthy means that everyone is happy for him.”

While Hartman was out last week redshirt freshman Mitch Griffis more than held his own in his first career start in the 44-10 win over VMI. He passed for 288 yards and three touchdowns but Griffis said after the game that this was Hartman’s team.

In his 36 career games with the Demon Deacons Hartman has thrown 72 touchdown passes and has 11 rushing touchdowns. He’s nearing the 10000-yard mark in passing yards and can resume that pursuit on Saturday.

What this does for the Demon Deacons is give them a full arsenal on offense coming off a season where they set the school record for scoring at 41 points a game. Getting Hartman back now gives him time to round into shape against Vanderbilt and the following week against Liberty before fifth-ranked Clemson comes to Winston-Salem on Sept. 24.

“We’re very excited to get Sam back” Clawson said. “…He’s ready to go.”

Clawson said what Freischlag Goldman and Fleet did to help Hartman through this is an incredible story. “They dropped everything in their personal lives to make sure this was a good outcome” Clawson said “and I’m very grateful to all three of them and they are all great professionals and this is a great example of sports medicine medicine and the collaboration of our athletic department and the hospital in working extremely well.”

Silas Deane III visited 50 jails after he graduated from college. In most he noticed there wasn't infrastructure in place to help inmates plan their re-entry into society.

""Many facilities that I visited would simply have — if they had anything at all — a handwritten list that stated these are a couple of organizations that might provide employment transitional homes"" said Silas Deane III.

All 1835 inmates in the custody of the Davidson County Sheriff's Office now have access to the program called Community Readiness. It is available on kiosks inside the various correctional facilities.

For years the sheriff's office has been helping inmates make a re-entry plan. This software gets the resources and their community partners in front of more inmates.

""When people come to jail they're not usually in the best shape so when we open the doors of the jail for release we really want them prepared to re-enter society and be productive"" said Paul Mulloy programs director at the Davidson County Sheriff's Office.

The software is available in more than 30 jails across the southeast. It will be available in 500 jails just a few years from now.

The software developer sees this as helping more than just today's inmates.

""We're trying to simply provide these individuals an opportunity for a future for not only themselves but also for generations to come behind them"" said Deane.

Mulloy said if re-entry wasn't a focus more incarcerated people would re-offend.

""We see it with some of the clients that don't want to participate in the programming. They come back sooner than the ones who are actively participating and placed with community partners around release. It's a stark difference"" said Mulloy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwtc3BvcnRzLXRleGFzLXR5bGVyLWx1YmJvY2stMTU3MzdiMDRkODA5MmRmMzEzYjRmYjAxNjg1NWU4MWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Tech QB Shough sidelined again by left shoulder injury,"LUBBOCK Texas (AP) — Texas Tech quarterback Tyler Shough will miss significant time again after re-injuring his non-throwing shoulder in the season opener.

Red Raiders coach Joey McGuire said Monday that he expects Shough to be out three to six weeks. The quarterback in his second year starting at Tech after three seasons at Oregon has an examination scheduled for Wednesday and surgery is a possibility.

“That’s where it could prolong to six weeks if it is” first-year Tech coach McGuire said during his weekly news conference.

Shough missed the final eight games last season after breaking his left collarbone during the fourth game. He started Saturday night and injured that same shoulder in the first half of Tech’s season-opening 63-10 win over Murray State.

McGuire said this injury is “not exactly” where it was last year but was still related to the collarbone. Shough didn’t have surgery after getting hurt last season.

Texas Tech’s depth chart for Saturday’s home game against No. 24 Houston lists Donovan Smith as the starting quarterback ahead of Behren Morton. Shough was listed as third on the chart.

After Shough got hurt in the game against Murray State Smith came off the bench to complete 14 of 16 passes for 221 yards and four touchdowns with his first two passes going for scores. Shough was 6-of-10 passing or 154 yards and a TD.

The Red Raiders have consecutive nonconference games against ranked teams first against Houston and then at 13th-ranked North Carolina State. Their Big 12 opener is Sept. 24 at home against Texas in the fourth game — the same opponent and same week Shough got hurt last season.

Shough’s injury is on the left arm the same collarbone he broke last season in Week 4 against Texas. That break caused him to miss the remainder of the 2021 season.

McGuire said that surgery is an option that will be determined when Shough meets with team doctors on Wednesday. Surgery would keep Shough sidelined for longer than six weeks.

He was told: “We don’t do religion here.” Across the Valley at Salesforce – a cloud-based software company – he heard they do.

It wasn’t long before he was there and his previous firm was doing a serious rethink of their no-religion policy.

More than ever before employers big and small are wrestling with issues of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI). Much of this work has been – rightly – focused on supporting empowering and celebrating their employees of color women the LGBTQ+ community and people with disabilities among others.

Some employers like the engineer’s previous Silicon Valley employer have shied away from including religion as a part of DEI seeming to believe that the concept of separation of church and state applies to the workplace and marketplace. Some employers are fearful that such a focus would import political culture wars into the company inflaming tensions and deepening divisions.

My experience shows the opposite to be true – that including a focus on faith can reinforce other areas of DEI as well as increase trust engagement and ultimately profitability.

In my leadership with the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation I have seen firsthand how top Fortune 500 companies have included religion within their DEI initiatives – including household names such as American Airlines Intel Dell PayPal  Target Tyson Foods AIG Google American Express Ford Intuit Accenture and more. All score highly on our annual Corporate Religious Equity Diversity & Inclusion (REDI) Index. And all see more payoffs than problems with religious inclusion.

The Foundation set out to explore the workplace religious freedom movement because it is a very hopeful model for society at large.

As migrants from around the world have brought their faith with them and a growing share of Americans claim no particular religion the U.S. has become much more religiously diverse than just a few decades ago. When most people were Christian it was hard to see how religion fit into DEI – but today walk down the halls of any top company and you’ll see the United Nations in miniature. The old rationale for not including faith in DEI no longer makes sense. Christians of all denominations are increasingly realizing that they are also a part of this rich pluralism. And that’s led to a breakthrough.

The union of religion with DEI is proving successful for businesses by helping coworkers better understand and work with their teammates and helping companies better understand their clients customers and stakeholders.

Many religious DEI efforts are facilitated through company-sponsored employee-led faith-and-belief-based Employee Resource Groups (ERGs).

At the Intel Corporation the lead of the global Intel Bible-based Christian Network ERG took the initiative to form an interfaith coalition with the other religious ERGs (Baha'i Hindu Jewish Muslim and Sikh) – as well as the “Agnostics Atheists and Allies at Intel” ERG. The good will among these groups is evident in their day-to-day work. For example when a member of the Christina ERG from Christian-majority Costa Rico was assigned a big project in Muslim-majority Malaysia the Christian lead connected him with the Muslim lead to learn more about Muslim culture resulting in stronger business success.

Salesforce’s customer relationship management solutions have become a top tool for faith-based organizations. Customers include Islamic Relief Worldwide which helps provide care for orphans around the world the Salvation Army which uses the Salesforce platform to coordinate and manage disaster relief and Compassion International which uses Salesforce to coordinate response to violent attacks globally. Salesforce didn’t set out to be a faith-based ministry support tool but its ""Faithforce"" ERG gives the company religious literacy and competency to expand in this huge market.

To be fully successful DEI cannot just be transactional or about fulfilling program metrics – it operates at its best when utilized to foster authentic connections between people. These connections are key to ensuring a company’s ultimate success.

A fabulous video introducing Google’s Inter Belief Network (IBN) puts it this way: “IBN is not about reducing anyone’s beliefs down to a common denominator it’s about being fully authentic and celebrating the differences that make us unique.”

The Religious Freedom & Business Foundation’s research has found that when faith is included in DEI it reinforces and expands the work of other diversity groups – what we refer to as a religion dividend. One example is Dell Technologies’ Interfaith ERG campaign to educate its global workforce about the scourge of human trafficking. The Interfaith ERG realized this was not just an issue affecting religious communities but every community. They invited all 13 of the company’s other diversity ERGs including Pride Women Abilities Veterans Race etc. to join them in the campaign representing the first time in Dell’s history to see a pan-ERG global initiative.

The business world’s success with this initiative has proven how the inclusion of religion benefits individuals workplaces and society. Religion can be included in other areas and sectors to help foster diverse ideas – such as with programs like the Faith and Media Initiative which aims to bridge a union between two fractured sectors. I am thrilled to be a part of FAMI which is working to facilitate better relationships and deeper understanding between media and communities of faith – and in so doing bring a new focus to a wide range of ways in which faith touches our daily lives including at work.

Ensuring faith has a seat at the table – in business society media and more – is how we can improve and enhance diversity of thought and connections. If people want to truly feel accepted and included in their workplace and if employers want fully empowered workforces religion has to play a part in that inclusion as well.

MWPVL International Inc. which tracks Amazon’s real-estate footprint estimates the company has either shuttered or killed plans to open 42 facilities totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space. The company has delayed opening an additional 21 locations totaling nearly 28 million square feet according to MWPVL. The e-commerce giant also has canceled a handful of European projects mostly in Spain the firm said.

Just this week Amazon warned officials in Maryland that it plans to close two delivery stations next month in Hanover and Essex near Baltimore that employ more than 300 people. The moves are a striking contrast with previous years when the world’s largest e-commerce company typically entered the fall rushing to open new facilities and hire thousands of workers to prepare for the holiday shopping season. Amazon continues to open facilities where it requires more space to meet customer demand.

“There remains some serious cutting to do before year-end — in North America and the rest of the world” said Marc Wulfraat MWPVL’s founder and president. “Having said this they continue to go live with new facilities this year at an astonishing pace.”

Maria Boschetti an Amazon spokesperson said it’s common for the company to explore multiple locations at once and make adjustments “based upon needs across the network.”

“We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers” she said in an emailed statement. “We have dozens of fulfillment centers sortation centers and delivery stations under construction and evolving around the world.”

The Maryland closings are part of an initiative to shift work to more modern buildings Amazon says. “We regularly look at how we can improve the experience for our employees partners drivers and customers and that includes upgrading our facilities” Boschetti said. “As part of that effort we’ll be closing our delivery stations in Hanover and Essex and offering all employees the opportunity to transfer to several different delivery stations close by.”

Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy has pledged to unwind part of a pandemic-era expansion that saddled Amazon with a surfeit of warehouse space and too many employees. The company has typically weaned its ranks of hourly workers by leaving vacant positions open slowing hiring and tightening disciplinary or productivity standards. But warehouse closings are also part of the mix and workers are bracing for more. During the second quarter Amazon’s workforce shrank by roughly 100000 jobs to 1.52 million the biggest quarter-to-quarter contraction in the company’s history.

The Seattle company has also been seeking to sub-lease at least 10 million square feet of warehouse space Bloomberg reported in May.

When homebound shoppers stampeded online during the pandemic Amazon responded by doubling the size of its logistics network over a two-year period a rapid buildout that exceeded that of rivals and partners like Walmart Inc. United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. For a time Amazon was opening a new warehouse somewhere in the U.S. roughly every 24 hours. Jassy told Bloomberg in June that the company had decided in early 2021 to build toward the high end of its forecasts for shopper demand erring on the side of having too much warehouse space rather than too little.

Wulfraat said that most of the closings announced this year are delivery stations smaller buildings that hand off already packaged items to drivers. Facilities that have been canceled include several planned fulfillment centers giant warehouses containing millions of items. MWPVL estimates that

Amazon operates more than 1200 logistics facilities large and small around the U.S.

More belt-tightening could complicate Amazon’s already fraught relations with organized labor. Earlier this year an upstart labor union started by a fired Amazon worker won a historic victory at a company warehouse in Staten Island New York. A federal labor official on Thursday rejected

Amazon’s bid to overturn the result. In August workers at an Amazon facility near Albany New York filed a petition to hold a union election there.

How much overcapacity Amazon needs to work through is hard to gauge and some analysts believe the extra space will come in handy during the Christmas holiday season."

The Minneapolis-based company says later this year all employees in the United States and Canada will now make at least $20 an hour including employees who move to US Bank from MUFG Union Bank after it is acquired as well as those who work at the front-line branch call center and operations center in the United States.

US Bank says the raise comes after employees brought up concerns regarding inflation and market dynamics.

In June the bank’s minimum base rate was increased from $15 to $18 an hour.

Company officials also say employees who get a pay increase will continue to be eligible for merit increases during the first quarter of 2023.

According to the company’s latest announcement employees will see an increase starting in early November.

Elcio Barcelos the Chief Human Resources Officer for US Bank issued the following prepared statement in a news release announcing the raise:

“We know that the current economic and inflationary environment is presenting challenges for many people – including our employees. To address these pressures we’re providing a 3% base pay increase for roughly 35000 hourly and salaried employees and increasing our minimum base pay rate to $20 an hour.” Elcio Barcelos",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbGJhbmtlci5jb20vYmFua2luZy9pbi10aGUtdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy13aHktc28tZmV3LW5ldy1iYW5rcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In the United States Why So Few New Banks?,"By Jeffrey P. Marsico President The Kafafian Group Inc.

The US banking system is unique in its history and industry structure. The incredibly shrinking US banking landscape is probably no surprise to the rest of the world. At the end of 2021 the United States had one FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)-insured bank for approximately every 68000 people. The United Kingdom had approximately one monetary financial institution (MFI: banks and building societies) for every 185000 people.

Consolidation should not surprise anyone. But in many US circles consolidation feels overdone especially since we had more than 15000 FDIC-insured financial institutions in 1990 and are now below 5000. Where is the bottom?

At the height of US bank mergers in 1997 there were 725 merger deals. But offsetting this were 199 new banks or de novos opened. In 2021 there were 215 bank M&A (merger and acquisition) deals representing 4.3 percent of all FDIC-insured institutions. Eight de novo charters were granted.

Why have US investors abandoned starting new banks? A compelling argument could be made for competition. Change is happening at historic levels in banking. What used to take more than 10 years for adoption—think the ATM (automated teller machine)—is now happening in less than two—think mobile banking. How will a very small financial institution be able to make the investments brought to market by Goldman Sach’s Marcus (backed by a $115-billion market cap owner) or Chime (funded by seven rounds of private equity totaling $2.3 billion)?

Another case could be made for regulation resulting in fewer de novos. How can a small financial institution obey the letter and spirit of the law and the myriad of regulations spawned from those laws in as efficient a manner as a financial institution 10 times no 100 times its size? Many existing banks cite the regulatory environment as the main reason they sold. The politicization of regulatory bodies only exasperates the situation. Ask those regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). It should be no surprise that the executives that decided to sell their financial institutions due to onerous regulations are hanging up their cleats rather than organizing a new bank.

And for sure both change and the regulatory environment play a role in the dearth of new bank-charter applications. But there is at least one other—one not mentioned as frequently but that might be the single greatest obstacle to new bank formation in the United States:

Math

If a bank has a business model that is unique or serves a narrow constituency regulators push back in the name of concentration risk or untried business models. I recall an internet bank that was trying to get off the ground in Michigan in the late 1990s. The concept was new and growth was projected to be robust albeit not off the charts. The FDIC required the bank to raise $20 million in capital a tidy sum back in the 1990s when banks started with less than half as much. Because the business model was unique at that time the regulators required a relatively high level of capital. The bankers couldn’t raise it and the de novo never got off the ground.

Today regulators are more open-minded… a little more. Varo Bank NA which Varo Money sponsored—the fintech started in 2015 undertook a three-year quest to obtain a bank charter. It succeeded in 2020. Their chief counsel stated “It takes a lot of patience because it’s a very long fairly complicated process and requires a tremendous amount of back and forth with the regulators.” Varo capitalized its bank with more than $120 million and added a second round of more than $400 million in the third quarter of 2021. Barrels full of capital open minds.

But what of the traditional de novo banks? So far this year (through mid-year) seven banks have received charters and 11 banks have applied excluding one application that was a special purpose charter of an existing financial institution. Of the 11 that applied the average capital sought to open was $26 million for those that disclosed it a far cry from Varo’s fundraising. What was the pitch to those investors for the $26 million? Here lies the math problem.

Investor pitch

Let’s say an investor group tired of big banks making decisions about their communities hundreds of miles away decides to explore starting a bank. They put together an outline of a business plan project out their financials for several years and visit the FDIC.

The FDIC looks at the business plan critiquing any part of it that is outside the norm serving a particular industry or industries relying on non-traditional distribution methods and so on. They suggest that being more plain vanilla will increase their chances of approval. And by the way it will require $26 million in startup capital the average capital raised for new banks this year. The investor group puts together a prospectus and begins soliciting shareholders for commitments.

Joe Investor has $10000 to invest. Does he put it with this new bank? Or does he invest in an S&P 500 Index Fund? The S&P 500 has had a compound annual total return of 9.3 percent over the past 10 years and 9.4 percent for the past five years. So Joe Investor projects an S&P 500 compound annual growth rate of 9.3 percent for the next 10 years.

For Startup Bank the organizers have projected the following over the next 10 years:

A $10000 investment in a de novo bank returns 24 percent less than the return Joe Investor could receive by investing in an S&P 500 Index Fund. And if Joe needs his money out of the fund he places his trade and the money will be in his bank account within three days. Startup Bank on the other hand would likely trade very little. For all US publicly traded banks between $250 million to $1 billion in assets the average trading volume is 2200 shares per day. Joe’s sell order on his holdings could move the market and decrease his value. There are no such worries when investing in a fund. That is one reason institutional investors own more than two-thirds of all US bank shares. Individual investors are choosing funds.

Business regeneration is a hallmark of healthy economies. There are advantages to having decision-makers reside in or very near the markets where their borrowers live and work. There is a deeper understanding of the nuances of granting credit. Imagine a credit analyst working hundreds or thousands of miles away from an Amish farmer borrower and reviewing that credit application. “They want to borrow how much against how much in income?” Whereas the local banker knows that the loan is golden. The farther away the borrower from the decision-maker the less likely character will play a meaningful role in the credit decision and the more difficult it will be to fund early-stage or nuanced businesses which inhibits business generation.

Perhaps the above projections for Startup Bank will no longer be the norm. Fintech (financial technology) business models typically call for significant amounts of capital accompanied by several years of operating losses so they can achieve scale quicker. Startup banks on the other hand are required to submit three-year business plans that demonstrate a profit by the end of the projection period. That requires the bank to strive for profitability far earlier than achieving critical mass to deliver solid returns to shareholders.

The antithesis to the traditional de novo path American Challenger Bank NA applied for a charter in July 2020 pledging to raise $750 million in capital. Instead of taking the traditional approval path it pivoted and agreed to merge with Patriot National Bancorp Inc. in November 2021. That transaction was conditionally approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July conditioned on among other things Patriot raising $875 million in capital.

This is clearly more fintech-like raising eye-popping sums of money to scale rapidly. Will this be the new norm? After American Challenger Bank NA and Patriot National received conditional approvals they terminated their deal. The conditions were too onerous. So I’m skeptical it will be the new norm. And it is unclear if fintechs will enjoy lofty valuations once they become banks. LendingClub which acquired Radius Bank in 2020 now trades at 1.3 times book value and less than 10 times earnings. These are bank-like multiples. All this puts a damper on fintechs becoming banks.

There is an economic case to be made however for traditional de novo banks. But lest you think that the dearth of de novo banks is a regulatory or industry-change problem I have news for you. It’s a math problem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3UtYmFuay1jZW9zLWNvbnN1bWVycy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLTIyMTkyNjAxNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. bank CEOs say consumers and businesses are still in good shape,"By Lananh Nguyen and Saeed Azhar

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumers and businesses are still in good financial shape despite high inflation and concerns about a looming recession some of the nation's top bankers told a conference in New York on Tuesday.

Brian Moynihan chief executive officer of Bank of America Corp the nation's second-largest bank said customers spent 10% more in August from a year earlier and bank account balances are higher for many than they were pre-pandemic.

""The consumer and businesses are in good shape"" said William Rogers chief executive officer of Truist Financial Corp. ""And the commercial and corporate side businesses have never been in better health. Companies' balance sheets are all really strong.""

The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates as it tries to tame inflation sparking fears the central bank could cause a recession.

U.S. banks stand to benefit from rising interest rates because they can earn more income from charging interest to customers. Still if rate hikes do send the economy into recession that could cut in to banks' profits.

Low unemployment a strong housing market and a revival of the entertainment industry in California reflect a solid economy there said Kelly Coffey CEO of City National Bank a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada.

The combination of COVID-19 government stimulus and a strong job market are still buoying consumer finances said René Jones CEO of M&T Bank.

""When we look at our credit statistics"" such as delinquencies and charge-offs they are ""very much below where we were pre-pandemic and it's going to take a long time to normalize back to where we were.""

In reality though most of the trucks you see on the roads today are owned by small companies with five or fewer vehicles. For years many of these “mom-and-pop” businesses struggled to make ends meet because they lacked the tools and connections to easily engage with big manufacturers retailers distributors and other large shippers.

Now with the arrival of Uber Freight carriers have a way to connect with these enterprises electronically and easily line up loads using the Uber Freight app. Drivers can book a shipment with just a few taps and eliminate the hassle of back-and-forth negotiations using phone calls and faxes. Carriers can haul loads on a range of trucks from flatbeds and dry vans to refrigerated “reefers” and choose their preferred route and load type.

For large shippers Uber Freight came along at just the right time giving them the ability to better manage the surge in freight demand they’ve been facing recently. Shippers can connect with truckers on the Uber Freight marketplace to plan book and track every shipment. Through the app shippers can secure a truckload in real time with guaranteed capacity behind it giving them greater flexibility and control.

“The experience that Uber brought to the rides market and personal transportation market was largely absent from the trucking business” says Bill Driegert Head of Operations and Cofounder of Uber Freight. “At the core we are just trying to make the market more efficient.”

Integration with Oracle Transportation Management (OTM)

Shippers can now connect with carriers even more easily through the integration of Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) and the Uber Freight API. “OTM is the system of record for many transportation customers around the world” says Derek Gittoes Vice President of Product Strategy and head of Oracle Transportation Management. “Enterprises use OTM to plan and execute billions of dollars and millions of shipments around the world every year.”

With the direct integration of the Uber Freight API with Oracle Transportation Management shippers can tap into a marketplace of carriers ready to provide extra freight capacity at a moment’s notice. It gives shippers instant visibility into real-time pricing and carrier capabilities such as refrigeration and industry certifications so they can find the best hauler for each shipment. They can see and lock in rates from the app in minutes resulting in reduced overhead costs and more flexible operations.

Many shippers have already seen significant efficiencies using this integration. One multinational consumer products company now manages 30% of its freight through the Uber Freight API and has reduced total transportation costs by 5%.

When using real-time pricing instead of RFP and spot auction shippers save on average 10% or more per load. Similarly the savings from access to real-time pricing versus contract pricing can be as much as 5%. Other benefits include auto tender acceptance and operations teams that are readily available for support.

Attracting diversity

Today if carriers want to work with Uber Freight they can simply log on to the platform and sign up without ever having to make a phone call. As a result Uber Freight has seen huge success bringing more and more carriers on the platform. These include a diverse group of drivers from North America’s Punjab Polish and Hispanic communities a growing contingent of young digitally native drivers and other operators who are just dissatisfied with the traditional brokerage model.

Once they’ve signed up truckers can get access to a wide range of resources and guidance including weekly route planning tools payment schedules and timely information such as what stops along the way offer the cheapest fuel and tires. Uber Freight was also first-to-market with an online ratings feature that lets drivers post reviews of transportation facilities resulting in improvements to many of the pickup and delivery locations they visit.

Going green

Sustainability and transportation efficiency go hand in hand. Using Uber Freight and Oracle companies can better plan their routes to optimize fuel efficiency—which not only saves on energy costs but helps protect the environment by minimizing waste and pollution.

“One of the biggest challenges is the number of miles that are driven empty—in other words trucks driving without any loads” says Gittoes. “We help companies be more efficient in how they optimize their routes so that fuel is used at maximum efficiency.”

Uber Freight is exploring renewable diesel programs with some of its haulers and expects to see more of its drivers adopting electric vehicles. “This could ultimately transform the entire transportation ecosystem” says Driegert. “The frontier is a truck that can go 600 miles on one charge and recharge in under 10 minutes.”

Together Uber Freight and Oracle have been focused on building out shipper capabilities and embedding new transportation technologies into shippers’ core operations. Overall the Uber Freight integration with OTM leads to a more efficient and stable supply chain which is especially critical through periods of disruption. The pandemic has had a huge impact on many businesses and supply chains and it's really demonstrated the value of having the right technology at the right time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YWhvbWVwYWdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3huYS11YmVyLWRyaXZlcnMtY3JlYXRlLXN1cmdlLXJhaXNpbmctcHJpY2UtZm9yLXJpZGUv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubndhaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL25ld3MveG5hLXViZXItZHJpdmVycy1jcmVhdGUtc3VyZ2UtcmFpc2luZy1wcmljZS1mb3ItcmlkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,XNA Uber drivers create ‘surge’ raising price for ride,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nwahomepage.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/xna-uber-drivers-create-surge-raising-price-for-ride/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167111136A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YWhvbWVwYWdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3huYS11YmVyLWRyaXZlcnMtY3JlYXRlLXN1cmdlLXJhaXNpbmctcHJpY2UtZm9yLXJpZGUv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubndhaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL25ld3MveG5hLXViZXItZHJpdmVycy1jcmVhdGUtc3VyZ2UtcmFpc2luZy1wcmljZS1mb3ItcmlkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzUwNDkxMS91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1sb3Nlcy13ZWVrLW9mLWVhcm5pbmdzLWFmdGVyLWltcG9zdGVyLXNjYW0tY2FsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver loses week of earnings after 'imposter scam' call,"SALT LAKE CITY — A ride-share driver warns others of a scam that emptied his wallet while claiming to be customer support.

Cody Webb started to drive for Uber five years ago as a part-time hustle.

“I love it. I love meeting people” Webb said. “It’s been crazy busy.”

And now it’s his full-time job.

“No pun intended but a great ride” Webb said with a laugh.

Everything was headed in the right direction until an unexpected call last weekend.

A person claiming to be with Uber support notified him of a passenger’s complaint that Webb’s photo didn’t match the app.

“I thought that was odd that there was a complaint” Webb explained.

The caller told him they were investigating and would get back to him. Later that day a second number called him and gave him a card number to enter into the Uber app to reimburse him for the ride in question.

However as soon as Webb entered the number.

“The money went out of my wallet. It was missing” he said.

About a week’s worth of work $1237.43 disappeared from Webb’s Uber app.

“That’s when I realized I was like oh my gosh I just got scammed” Webb said. “We’re left with nothing. We can’t even pay our rent.”

He got a hold of the actual Uber account security and risk team seeing if they could help. Messages show Uber acknowledged Webb had been scammed.

“‘There’s no evidence suggest your account has been compromised'” Webb reads the messages from Uber. “‘After reviewing your account we have determined that you are ineligible for a refund.'”

It’s been a stressful couple of days for Webb and his family as he tries to re-earn his money and retain his diamond driving status.

“Just educate yourself. Be aware. Look for those red flags” Webb said.

KSL TV contacted Uber about this incident after talking to Webb and the ride-sharing company said they restored Webb’s earnings. Uber said they are aware of these “imposter scams” and are working to prevent them."

The beauty giant has been partnering with enterprise technology development platform provider Iterate.ai since 2016 to develop deploy and scale a number of leading-edge digital customer experiences. Ulta Beauty uses the company’s Interplay middleware solution a drag-and-drop environment for rapid app development and production via modularized pre-built components.

Interplay delivers Ulta Beauty a low-code environment featuring both customization and drag-and-drop functionality. The platform includes 475 pre-built modules that offer features such as advanced AI/ML IoT voice headless commerce blockchain data integration and API connections.

“We could not have built the cutting-edge applications as efficiently as we did without our partners at Iterate.ai” said Michelle Pacynski VP of digital innovation Ulta Beauty. “As early believers and first-movers on Iterate’s low-code invention we quickly understood which applications were going to work and which weren’t. The ability to experiment rapidly allowed us to make confident data-backed decisions that have allowed us to capitalize on opportunities where we can authentically and directly engage our guests in various experiences.”

Utilizing Interplay Ulta Beauty has been able to develop a number of customer-facing solutions with fast experimentation and a reduced need for hardcoding. These include an artificial intelligence (AI)-based skincare virtual beauty advisor it offers on the ulta.com. e-commerce site. The virtual advisor enables customers to browse the retailer’s skincare assortment by concern or by-product.

The virtual beauty advisor asks a series of dynamically generated questions and presents a set of personalized recommendations that can be further reviewed and then purchased.

Other digitally-enabled customer service offerings Ulta Beauty has developed with Interplay include curbside pickup. Initially launched in May 2020 as many stores remained closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic the curbside offering was an extension of Ulta’s existing (and at that time paused) buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS) service and used a similar process.

“Ulta Beauty exemplifies how a dedicated low-code strategy can power a transformative pace of innovation—in this case around 10 times faster than hardcoding” said Brian Sathianathan CTO Iterate.ai. “When a business can deliver exciting new features and adapt to customer needs with low-code speed they rapidly gain customer satisfaction and competitive differentiation. We’re proud of our partnership and look forward to continued success with Interplay and Ulta Beauty’s innovation team.”

One particular beauty store is increasingly finding itself the target of thieves both in St. Louis and nationwide.According to St. Louis County Police Sergeant Tracy Panus three St. Louis County Ulta Beauty stores were each hit by thieves three times in August alone.The nine larcenies occurred at Ulta stores in Creve Coeur Affton and Fenton. In every incident more than $750 of merchandise was stolen making the thefts felonies. Many of the incidents involved groups of three to six individuals working in tandem to pilfer merchandise from the beauty store.One woman posted to Facebook saying that she saw teenagers at the Fenton location ""who filled up pillow cases like it was Halloween.""Ulta stores seem to be facing issues of theft nationwide.In June two women at an Ulta in Little Rock calmly stashed items in tote bags and walked out the door. A video of them later went viral on Tik Tok. Later that same month in Chicago a “theft crew” was arrested for stealing from the same Ulta twice making off with $200000 worth of merchandise between the two thefts. Last week a Bronx man was charged for stealing $35000 worth of goods from a Westport Connecticut Ulta. Other high-dollar value thefts were reported over the summer in Tulsa Knoxville and Kalamazoo.After a $2000 heist from an an Ulta outside of Philadelphia a lieutenant with the Plymouth Township Police Department theorized to the ABC affiliate there that Ulta's are being targeted because the stolen fragrance cologne and other beauty products can be easily resold at a decent price.That is allegedly the motive behind a string of Ulta larcenies that happened in the St. Louis area last year for which two men have pleaded guilty and another is awaiting trial.Last month in federal court St. Louis County man Demetrius Owens 20 was sentenced to a year in federal prison for his part in a theft ring that stole more than $140000 worth of merchandise from six Ulta stores throughout Missouri including in St. Louis. The thefts are alleged to have happened between November 2020 and January 2021.Owens pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud for his part in the scheme. Leo Finerson 37 pleaded guilty to concealing a felony. A case is still pending against the third co-defendant Ryan Jones 38 on two charges of wire fraud.According to federal prosecutors Owens and Jones broke into Ulta stores at night stealing anywhere from $9000 to almost $35000 worth of perfume men's cologne and other beauty supplies per larceny. St. Louis-area Ulta locations they allegedly hit included in Brentwood Chesterfield Creve Coeur and Fenton. Prosecutors say the men also committed similar thefts at other Missouri Ulta stores in Columbia and Washington.Finerson was accused of taking videos of the stolen products and selling the items on Facebook marketplace.Unlike the six figure theft ring the current spate of Ulta thefts are playing out in plain view during business hours.Last August police released a still from the Fenton Ulta's security footage of a man dubbed the ""Smell Good Bandit."" The Croc-wearing individual filled a tote bag with $3200 worth of merchandise and walked out of the store. Police say no arrest was ever made.Last month an Ulta shopper posted to Facebook about how she saw a man causally walk out of the Brentwood store with a basket full of cologne he hadn’t paid for. “Workers said hey” she wrote. ""And he continued walking out at a regular ass speed…had zero pep in his step smh.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXRhaWx0b3VjaHBvaW50cy5jb20vdG9waWNzL3N1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1zb3VyY2luZy91bHRhLWJlYXV0eS1hbWVyaWNhbi1lYWdsZS1zaGFyZS1ob3ctc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLWNhbi1kcml2ZS10aGUtZW50aXJlLWNvbXBhbnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ulta Beauty American Eagle Share How Supply Chain Investments Can Drive the Entire Company,"Supply chain and last mile challenges have been grabbing headlines for months and executives from Ulta Beauty American Eagle and others shared their advice on how retailers can turn these troubles into opportunities at the Home Delivery World logistics conference. The big takeaway: managing costs and keeping shelves stocked while also delivering on speed efficiency and sustainability have become valuable differentiators that can help any company get ahead of the competition.

“Who could have predicted that supply chain would be driving headlines across news outlets?” said Aimee Bayer-Thomas Chief Supply Chain Officer at Ulta Beauty during her keynote Fueling Business and Associate Growth With a Dynamic Agile Supply Chain Organization. “Simply put if you’re not winning in supply chain you’re not winning at all. Now is the time for supply chain leaders to build and rebuild with the right talent the right culture and the right resources to fuel the business and to fuel growth.”

Ulta Beauty puts its supply chain at the center of its network and sees it as the driving force behind the experience of associates and customers alike. The retailer employs 40000 workers at 1300 of its own stores 200 locations inside Target stores and six fulfillment centers with a seventh on the way. With such a massive footprint strong supply chain practices are necessary to keeping everything running smoothly.

“We know that our teams are most successful when we lean into our mission and our best-in-class culture to empower value and challenge them” said Bayer-Thomas. “Today companies are either disrupting or they’re being disrupted. Ulta Beauty is rising to the occasion as a visionary in the ways that we lead our organization and we know we couldn’t do it without our extremely strong supply chain behind it all.”

Ulta’s Three Pillars Connect Supply Chain Associates and Shoppers

Bayer-Thomas laid out the three pillars that help Ulta Beauty manage its supply chain and ultimately keep things running smoothly across the entire enterprise:

Network: Ensuring the right product is always at the right place at the right time at the right price;

Ensuring the right product is always at the right place at the right time at the right price; Innovation & Technology: Evolving technology and systems to enable new capabilities; and

Evolving technology and systems to enable new capabilities; and Capabilities & Processes: Optimizing processes across the business to drive simplicity and efficiency.

Developments that seem focused on one pillar can affect all three and the benefits trickle down to shoppers and associates as well. One example Bayer-Thomas provided was the rollout of autonomous robots in distribution centers — an Innovation & Technology investment that will support the Network by making it easier to get items where they need to be and will improve Capabilities & Processes by easing warehouse associates’ workload.

“Autonomous mobile robots are going to support retail and ecommerce picking which is going to allow our associates to pick for retail and ecommerce at the same time” said Bayer-Thomas. “We’ll have lots and blocks that will be assigned to them and they [will] only have to navigate through a couple of rows within a distribution center compared to the multi-level pick tower that they have to operate with today. This will reduce walking for our associates by 47%.”

Another innovation that will affect the entire journey is the introduction of control towers at distribution centers that will enable real-time visibility into the supply chain. Ulta will be better able to plan for potential stockouts based on availability at any given location and minimize the disruption caused by extreme weather or supplier delays by connecting with data across the supply chain to determine the best next steps for securing necessary inventory.

Customers won’t directly see the benefits of a data-driven supply chain but they can still feel them. Ulta’s technology investments aim to ensure that every item is available for every customer no matter where or how they want it in order to keep pace with the modern customer journey.

“We know that consumer journeys are changing and they’re no longer shopping in a linear fashion” said Bayer-Thomas. “Retail ecosystems are now seamless and guests and associates have to shift from brick-and-mortar to the digital platform fluidly. Similarly our supply chain foundation must also very fluidly serve as a foundation to this entire ecosystem — and this is true for all retailers.”

American Eagle Invests in Both Sustainability and Efficiency

Sustainability also has become a hot issue for supply chains and somewhat surprisingly this is an area where environmentally focused shoppers and bottom line-focused executives can find agreement according to Guru Pundoor VP of Supply Chain Data Analytics at American Eagle. The same technologies that are making supply chains more efficient also are making it greener.

“[The crisis] has definitely helped accelerate investment in areas that can help us” said Pundoor during a keynote panel How America’s Biggest Brands are Tackling the Supply Chain Crisis with Sustainability and Science. “In this case what has been good for sustainability has also been good for business. The longer the parcel has to travel the longer it takes to get to the customer and the more fossil fuels used. The less miles a parcel has to travel the less money it costs the business and the faster it gets to the customer.”

One way American Eagle has been reducing both costs and its carbon footprint is investing in technology that helps the retailer better understand what shoppers are ordering in which regions and through which channels. This reduces the number of deliveries required by ensuring items that are often bought together are available in the same distribution centers and stores rather than being shipped from multiple warehouses to complete an order.

“A lot of science we invested in was in building an algorithm to better understand what the customers buy together where demand is coming from and how you estimate the right product levels even before that product starts selling based on the profile of the customer” said Pundoor. “Then how do you build a fulfillment and transportation network that will support the need to have the right products in the right place?”

Finding the right marriage between data science and supply chain capabilities is one of the key challenges retailers are facing today. However these are far from the only issues that need to be addressed together since the supply chain impacts every element of the business from logistics to the customer experience. Supply chain executives need to reach out across their company to ensure investments are being made in the right places to benefit every aspect of their operations.

“Now is the time for supply chain leaders to build the right talent the right culture and the right resources to get the job done” said Ulta’s Bayer-Thomas. “We are leading and driving businesses forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15Y2hlc2NvLmNvbS9hL25ld3Mvc29jaWFsLWlzc3Vlcy9jcmltZS9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtaW4tY29ubmVjdGlvbi10by11bHRhLWJlYXV0eS10aGVmdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man Arrested in Connection to Ulta Beauty Theft,"Kareem Raekwon Johnakin (Submitted Image)

MANILA – Postmaster General Norman Fulgencio of the Philippine Postal Corporation (PHLPost) was guest speaker during the 60th founding anniversary celebration of the Asian-Pacific Postal Union (APPU) held at Shangri-La Hotel Bangkok in Thailand over the weekend.

He cited the gains of the country in pushing for the digital innovation and modernization of PHLPost.

“Under the new administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. he prioritized the digitalization of public services towards greater efficiency and accountability of public services including the Post Office. In this ever-changing times digital innovation is the only way to go for businesses to be relevant” Fulgencio said in his speech.

Among PHLPost’s gains are the relaunch of its website wherein clients can digitally pay their duties and taxes as well as do online purchasing of stamps and partnership with the Bureau of Customs for the adoption of digital transactions.

He said the electronic-commerce revolution presents a vast economic potential for the Asia-Pacific being one of the largest regions in the Universal Postal Union.

“There is a need for each country to collaborate and cooperate effectively amid the rapid advancement in technology and globalization” he said.

The APPU is an intergovernmental organization that extends facilitates and improves postal relations among the 32 member countries in the Asia-Pacific region -- Philippines Australia China Korea New Zealand Thailand Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan Brunei Darussalam Cambodia Fiji India Indonesia Iran Japan Lao Malaysia Mongolia Maldives Myanmar Nauru Nepal Pakistan Papua New Guinea Samoa Sri Lanka Singapore Solomon Islands Tonga Vanuatu and Vietnam.

“This event is very special for all of us. First we celebrate this historic and momentous occasion in solidarity with each of our country’s postal services. Secondly we appreciate your recognition of the role of the Philippine government in the foundation of APPU 60 years ago. It is our pride and honor that for the first 40 years of its history the Asian-Pacific Postal Union was based in Manila with the Postmaster General as Director” Fulgencio said.

Other speakers included Masahiko Metoki director general of Universal Postal Union International Bureau; Lin Hongliang secretary general APPU; and Ajarin Pattanapanchai Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society of Thailand.

Dr. VP Singh will take over as secretary general beginning 2023 after he was elected at the 13th APPU Congress also on Friday.

The APPU was conceptualized from a postal roundtable in Manila in 1961 with 18 countries drawing up the Asian-Oceanic Postal Convention that was held in April 1962.

In 2002 the APPU moved to Bangkok and the director position was opened to election by the member countries. (PNA)

UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvdXBzLWRyaXZlcnMtd2hvLWVhcm4tOTUwMDAtYS15ZWFyLWFyZS10aHJlYXRlbmluZy10by1zdHJpa2UtYW5kLWl0LWNvdWxkLWh1cnQtdmlydHVhbGx5LWV2ZXJ5LWFtZXJpY2FuLWxvb2stYXQtd2hhdC1oYXBwZW5lZC1pbi0xOTk3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS Teamsters union threatens strike: Here's a look back at 1997,"August 4 1997 probably doesn’t stand out as a significant day in world history. But some would disagree.

That’s was the first time United Parcel Service (UPS) workers organized a nationwide strike in the U.S. which ended up with the company losing almost $780 million. In the 15 days that the strike lasted 80% of UPS shipments went undelivered.

Now it may be happening again.

The world’s biggest courier service is facing a union battle as workers demand higher pay and better working conditions. Contract negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters Union which represents drivers and warehouse workers are slated to take place in the spring as existing contracts expire in July 2023.

Even before the next-day delivery and online shopping revolution took the economy by storm a strike by UPS workers created a void that no other company could fill. The likes of FedEx and US Postal Service offer similar services but they represent a sliver of the capacity that UPS bears.

Nearly 6% of U.S. gross domestic product is facilitated by the services of UPS alone every year. If workers decide to suspend delivery or hold up their work in local warehouses for a prolonged period like in 1997 the ripple effects could affect almost every American.

“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry” UPS said in a statement this month. “We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”

UPS employs 350000 of the Teamsters force of 534000 workers globally. Since mid-2018 UPS has hired over 72000 Teamsters making them a core segment of the company’s operations.

The courier giant pays its package delivery drivers $95000 a year on average plus pension benefits the highest among its competitors who often hire drivers on a contract basis. Earlier this year UPS eliminated some extra pay it had given to part-time workers in certain cities where the job market was particularly tight and during the busy holiday season. Some workers complained that it was a pay cut while UPS countered that the additional pay was never intended to be permanent and that it had added an additional attendance bonus to offset the reduced pay.



“We know from a lot of research that large employers set the standards” said Robert Bruno professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “So if you get a large company a leading company like UPS that touches a lot of different local economies that has a lot of economic impact across the 50 states … what they agree to with their union will set a standard in the marketplace.”



The current contract was approved under the leadership of legendary former Teamsters president James Hoffa Jr. the son of the midcentury labor movement giant who disappeared and whose body has famously never been found. But the new contract Sean O’Brien is lobbying for would include better pay overtime work protection and safety against the scorching heat.



The Atlanta-based shipping company spends $270 million on safety for its workers. But the heat wave of the past summer saw several workers seek medical help to cope with the conditions at UPS’ distribution centers.



The union has also collected $300 million for a fund to pay members in the event that the Teamsters workers go on strike O’Brien told CNN.



Last month Teamsters counted a massive win at DHL for a newly ratified contract that boasted historic wage gains and offered greater benefits to full-time and part-time workers.



Bruno noted that timing is key for the Teamsters as they may be in fertile ground with more people of color women and young workers joining the current moment of resistance by organized labor. The friendly legal climate for labor under the Biden administration he says will also help establish more robust labor protections.

An impending strike could be yet another setback for the supply chain following the backlog from COVID-19. Wins in organizing labor through unions in 2022 point to a greater friction with employers. The recovery from the pandemic saw workers inclined to unionize across the nation including within and against corporate juggernauts like Starbucks and Amazon.

Correction Sept. 6 and Sept. 7 2022: An earlier version of this article misstated the city in which UPS is based. It is Atlanta. The article also misstated annual package delivery driver pay which averages $95000 without benefits and gave incorrect time frame for the hiring of 72000 Teamsters. That was since mid-2018.

Clarification Sept. 7 2022: Language in the article was changed to make clear that Teamsters-represented employees include drivers.

The labour movements at Amazon and Starbucks got attention but the one at United Parcel Service (UPS) is just catching up. UPS is the most prominent package courier worldwide and contract negotiations will begin between them and the Teamsters Union before their contract expires in July 2023. Experts predict that package handlers and drivers will strike even before talks have begun. Professor of Labor Relations Todd Vachon says it will be a question of how long the strike will be.

UPS workers make an average of $95000 and have access to traditional retirement pensions according to the company. In contrast Amazon drivers often earn much less and are independent contractors. FedEx drivers make a median salary of about $48000.

Better working conditions are also a top focus for union drivers who say they need air-conditioning in the panel trucks due to dangerous temperatures inside delivery vehicles.

Karin Nars: I joined IPAF in 2010 as a member of council and then in 2014 I joined the board. I started in the access business back in 2009. Back then I started at our family business Dino Lift in sales. That was a point when the market was crazy with the financial crisis and my father got very sick and I thought that I could help out. I was just kind of learning by doing in sales and I have some language skills that were beneficial. In addi-tion to Finnish and Swedish I speak English and French and German. So that of course helped me in a sales role. It was a perfect opportunity for me to real-ly quickly understand the business understand the customers and understand how it all works and also gain some momen-tum there.

Rental Magazine: What would you say have been some of your successes along the way?

Nars: My strength has always been listening to everybody and pulling in information. You should not think that you can do things alone and you have to work together you have to be a team learn from others and create a network of people who can support you. Being in a sales role I feel that customers also liked that I was listening very carefully and trying to learn what they need. I’m also not afraid of doing new things and trying new things. I have a strong belief that you have to be really honest about what you know and then learn from there.

Rental Magazine: On the flipside of that have you experienced any challenges along the way such as being a woman in a male-dominated field?

Nars: Of course and it’s a fantastic opportunity being the first woman president of IPAF to talk about this and how we could help other women to see that there are opportunities in our business. We also need to make women who already have careers in our industry visible and highlight them. If they’re not visible if they are always in roles that are in the background if they are not in the forefront people will not know that they are in fact there. We have launched a Women in Powered Access Initiative and one of the main first things we are doing is sharing stories about women that are in our industry. We let them tell their story and make those visible. The next step is translating all of that into actions. So we need to also make sure that women are visible in our industry events and that women are also invited as speakers in events. We need to focus more broadly on diversity equity and inclusion. There are a lot of people who have a hard time to get their voices heard and when our business is safety we need to make sure that everybody is listened to and everybody will have a voice and that everybody can express their opinion. Companies should have an organizational culture that allows people to fail and be vulnerable and to bring their whole selves to the workplace. And that goes for everybody; it’s not the gender thing. It’s about everybody.

Rental Magazine: So what advice might you have for people coming into the industry?

Nars: I’ve always believed a lot in mentor-ship and finding that one person who you have a strong connection with and who you can talk to in an open and honest way because you only need one; you don’t need hundreds of people who support you. It’s good to have somebody you know who has more experience than yourself. They will also learn from you so it’s a mutually beneficial experience.

Rental Magazine: Very well said. And do you have any goals moving forward that you would like for the organization?

Nars: We have a terrific three-year plan with strategic aims and objectives that talks a lot about digitalization and we have taken already some huge steps in that direction. It’s also very important that we are always delivering the member benefits that we are supposed to. So I’m really glad that we have made up a thorough member benefit study now and that we are making actions around that and digging a little bit deeper into those areas where we need to improve. Then of course we are working on getting more accidents and near misses reported. When we have the app launched it will bring us huge opportunities to more easily report near misses. Those are the ones that really enable us to learn and prevent accidents because every single accident that happens and every person that gets killed is one too many so we need to do those actions before the accidents happen. I also think it’s important to focus on how we can bring more women into the industry and our sustainability objectives both socially and environmentally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nLzUtYmlvdGVjaHMtd2l0aC1jYXNoLXJ1bndheXMtaW50by0yMDI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Biotechs With Cash Runways Into 2025,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/5-biotechs-with-cash-runways-into-2025 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nLzUtYmlvdGVjaHMtd2l0aC1jYXNoLXJ1bndheXMtaW50by0yMDI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbndsYy5vcmcvbm8tb25lLXNob3VsZC1oYXZlLXRvLWNob29zZS1iZXR3ZWVuLWdldHRpbmctYW4tYWJvcnRpb24tYW5kLXBheWluZy10aGVpci1yZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No One Should Have to Choose Between Getting an Abortion and Paying Their Rent,"No One Should Have to Choose Between Getting an Abortion and Paying Their Rent

Abortion access has always been tied to housing justice.

For decades being able to choose whether and when to become pregnant has positively affected a person’s economic security and in turn has improved their ability to secure a safe accessible affordable and stable place to live.

But now across the country many no longer have any choice when it comes to their own bodies and pregnancies.

The Supreme Court has overturned our constitutional right to abortion. And the ensuing attacks on abortion access amidst a nationwide housing crisis and skyrocketing rents have severe consequences for Black Latinx and Indigenous people who are disproportionately impacted by housing insecurity and abortion bans.

Where you live—and how much it costs to live there—have always influenced your ability to access or afford abortion care.

And this year rent has become even more unaffordable for millions of people including people who can become pregnant.

Between July 2021 and July 2022 rent in the United States rose by 6.3% the highest increase in 35 years. At this moment someone would need to be paid $21.25 per hour to afford a one-bedroom rental home or $25.82 per hour to afford a two bedroom. Housing in many states is even more expensive. Some states have minimum wages closer to $15 per hour higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour but still not enough to make housing affordable. Unsurprisingly the minimum wage is low in states that have eliminated or severely restricted abortion access.

For example Alabama and Texas both use the federal minimum wage. In Alabama where abortion has been wholly banned unless a pregnant patient’s life is in danger a minimum wage worker would have to work 74 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom rental home. In Texas where it’s now a felony to provide an abortion the situation is even more outrageous—for that same type of rental home a minimum wage worker would have to work 104 hours a week.

And if someone finds it difficult to pay rent they may also find it difficult to afford abortion care.

Due to gender inequities in our society women—particularly women facing intersecting forms of discrimination—are significantly more likely than men to not be paid enough to afford rent. This means that a pregnant person with limited economic resources may face an impossible decision: to pay for their abortion and risk eviction or to pay their rent and be forced to continue their pregnancy.

Given that many will now have to travel for abortion care—another costly expense—this decision becomes even more challenging. And to add another layer of cruelty the same states with a low minimum wage also do a terrible job of supporting pregnant people and families leading in child poverty rates.

And then to come full circle: criminal penalties related to abortion also jeopardize peoples’ access to housing.

Our nation’s history of sexist and racist housing policies already makes safe accessible and affordable housing harder to access for people of color particularly those impacted by the criminal legal system. Many public and private rentals conduct a criminal background check on applicants often disqualifying individuals with a criminal record. With Roe v. Wade overturned people across the country particularly people of color face even harsher criminal penalties for their pregnancy outcomes—and even more barriers to accessing the housing they need.

Where you live. What you choose to do with your body and your future.

These are some of the most personal and important decisions we make in our lifetimes.

But now with our country’s divestment from housing and the reversal of Roe v. Wade we don’t have the power to make them.

We must protect everyone’s right to autonomy. Because everyone deserves to decide what their life will look like—entirely for themselves.

While we advocate for proactive policies to make housing and abortion available and affordable know that abortion funds can provide financial assistance that directly covers the cost of abortion procedures and in some cases other costs like travel to access abortion. You can check out the National Network of Abortion Funds your local abortion fund or call 1-800-772-9100 if you can’t afford your abortion out of pocket.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZXF1aXRhYmxlZ3Jvd3RoLm9yZy9ob3ctY29ycG9yYXRlLWdvdmVybmFuY2Utc3RyYXRlZ2llcy1odXJ0LXdvcmtlci1wb3dlci1pbi10aGUtdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How corporate governance strategies hurt worker power in the United States,"Researchers studying the decades-long rise in earnings inequality and wage stagnation in the United States point to a number of reasons why the country’s income divide grew over the past 40 years or so. Declining union membership racist labor policies and changes in the industrial composition of the United States for example all have been found to be important drivers of economic disparities.

In addition to these trends and intentional policy choices that make workers worse-off social scientists are studying how corporate governance affects workers’ wages employment and ability to bargain collectively. These researchers are also looking into how the rise of shareholder value as the main objective of U.S. corporations relates to income inequality productivity and labor’s share of economic growth in the United States. This research offers evidence that the rise in shareholder power reinforces the impacts of the decline of the U.S. labor movement—a decline that has had broad spillover effects across the country’s economy and has limited workers’ ability to share in the gains of the economic value they create.

In this issue brief we examine a series of important changes to corporate governance in the United States between the 1970s and 1990s the simultaneous decline in the country’s job quality and worker power and the relationship between the two trends. Specifically we discuss some of the academic evidence on the relationship between the rise of shareholder primacy new management practices and workers’ labor market outcomes. We then turn to policy recommendations that have the potential to strengthen labor vis-à-vis shareholders—a set of proposals that would rebalance bargaining power in the labor force boosting productivity and promoting broadly shared economic growth.

How maximizing shareholder value became the main objective of U.S. corporate governance

“Shareholder primacy” is an economic and legal theory that proposes that maximizing wealth for shareholders should be the main if not the sole objective of publicly traded companies. This framework became the dominant model driving corporate governance in the United States beginning around four decades ago gaining prominence as a number of economic social and academic shifts allowed it to displace the “managerialist” philosophy that guided public companies’ decision-making processes during the mid-20th century.

As legal scholar Lynn Stout explains for most of the post-World War II era large U.S. corporations generally thought of themselves as serving the interest of a wide variety of stakeholders—customers suppliers workers and local communities. Yet between the 1970s and the 1990s maximizing shareholder value came to trump every other corporate interest and priority.

A number of economic changes led to the growth of shareholder primacy. In the 1970s for example corporations began to look for new business models after facing several economic crises alongside an increase in international competition in industries such as car manufacturing and consumer electronics and poor performance as companies grew too big. At the same time William Lazonick at the University of Massachusetts and Mary O’Sullivan at the University of Geneva propose there was a shift in the distribution of stockholding away from households and toward large institutional investors. This occurred as the U.S. financial sector loosened restrictions on the extent to which life insurance companies and pension funds could own corporate equities. Indeed the share of U.S. corporate equities held by institutions soared from 10 percent in the early 1950s to more than 60 percent in the early 2000s.

As shareholders in general—and institutional investors in particular—came to have greater influence over business operations U.S. corporations underwent a series of changes. Executives and managers looked to maximize shareholder value by increasingly engaging in mergers downsizing their workforces deploying de-unionization tactics and increasingly using corporate funds for shareholder payments in the form of stock buybacks and corporate dividends. As the interests of shareholders and executives became more tightly aligned through equity-based and other incentive pay schemes the compensation of executives skyrocketed.

U.S. job quality and workers’ bargaining power simultaneously declines

Meanwhile economic sociologists Neil Fligstein and Take-Jin Shin at the University of California Berkeley write the advent of shareholder primacy meant that publicly traded firms increasingly perceived workers as input costs rather than as contributors to be included or considered in the corporate decision-making process.

As such overall job quality in the United States started to decline in the late 1970s. Real wages for nonsupervisory workers started to fail to keep up with productivity gains. Union membership shrunk from more than 20 percent in 1983 to 10 percent in 2021. A variety of factors including international trade ineffective labor laws increasingly hostile labor-management relations and deindustrialization and the decline of manufacturing reinforced one another and exacerbated the decline of institutionalized worker bargaining power in the final decades of the 20th century.

Playing into this changing economic landscape according to David Weil at Brandeis University was a fundamental change in the way firms organized themselves and structured their workforces. This so-called fissuring of the workforce describes how big firms stopped directly employing workers that perform roles outside the core competency of their businesses. Janitorial services for example were largely transferred to a smaller network of firms through arrangements such as subcontracting and franchising allowing large corporations to avoid the costs and obligations of traditional employment relationships with their janitorial staff. For workers this shift generally resulted in lower compensation less access to employer-provided benefits fewer opportunities for career advancement and greater vulnerability to labor law violations.

Similarly Arne Kalleberg at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and David Howell at the New School University argue that the rise of the financial sector and the prevalence of shareholder value strategies in the United States contributed to the erosion of labor market institutions including the fall in the real value of the minimum wage weakening union bargaining power and the decline in the protective effect of laws and regulations that govern employment relationships.

Christopher Kollmeyer at the University of Aberdeen and John Peters at Laurentian University likewise find evidence that between the early 1970s and the early 2010s U.S. corporate governance strategies that shrunk labor costs and redirected resources away from productive investment contributed to the decline in union density in a number of high-income countries including the United States.

To be sure firms’ growing concern with maximizing shareholder value was not the only important change in U.S. business strategies between the 1970s and 1990s let alone in the U.S. economy writ large. Yet there is evidence that the advent of shareholder value as the most important concern for corporate governance had important effects on wage growth income inequality and workers’ ability to bargain for better workplace conditions in the United States.

Empirical evidence demonstrates that shareholder primacy lowers workers’ wages and worsens employment outcomes

While several scholars have long proposed that the rise of shareholder power affects workers recent empirical studies contribute to the academic understanding of the size and importance of shareholder power’s effect and the precise mechanisms through which shareholder primacy influences labor market outcomes.

For example an analysis by José Azar of the University of Navarra Yue Qiu of Temple University and Aaron Sojourner of the Upjohn Institute finds that greater common ownership in a labor market—or the concentration of investment positions of public companies in the hands of a few large institutional shareholders—is associated with both lower wages and a lower employment-to-population ratio. With about 1 in 3 U.S. private-sector workers employed in publicly traded firms the concentration of shareholders across firms through common ownership by institutional investors could play a significant role in the overall structure of the labor market.

Likewise in a new working paper Antonio Falato of the Federal Reserve Board Hyunseob Kim at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Till von Wachter at the University of California Los Angeles examine the relationship between shareholder power and workers’ earnings and employment. The authors find that as establishments experience an increase in ownership by institutional shareholders they also experience a decline in employment and payroll costs. This finding holds both at the establishment and the industry level.

Moreover Falato Kim and Von Wachter find that an increase in ownership by institutional shareholders explains about a quarter of the decline in the ratio of total wages and salaries to Gross Domestic Income—a metric that has seen an important drop in the past four decades— between 1980 and 2014. (See Figure 1).

Figure 1

Lenore Palladino at Smith College also studies the relationship between profits shareholder payments and wage growth finding that as shareholder payments as a percent of companies’ profits grew the share of profits that went to workers’ wages declined. In addition through firm-level empirical analysis and accounting for macroeconomic factors and a number of firm-specific characteristics Palladino shows that as shareholder payments as a portion of operating expenses increased between 1984 and 2017 wages paid to workers fell.

Evidence also shows that as shareholder primacy and the financialization of the U.S. economy more broadly influence workers’ outcomes these trends also contribute to widening racial and gender inequality in the U.S. labor market. Indeed a team of researchers finds that between the 1980s and the 2010s the pay for workers in managerial occupations did not only outpace the pay of workers in other types of jobs but White and Latino men also have benefited disproportionately from this financial and managerial wage premium.

Business practices that lead from shareholder primacy to inefficient and inequitable workplace outcomes

What mechanisms underlie the effect of shareholder primacy on workplace outcomes? One body of research looks at the role of managers and management practices. Indeed it appears as though the rise of the shareholder primacy ethos as taught in business schools has reduced any tendency toward rent-sharing with workers. Following the guidance of economist Milton Friedman who proclaimed “the social responsibility of businesses is to increase profits” business school philosophy tends to view workers as costs rather than stakeholders.

For example Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alex He of the University of Maryland and Daniel le Maire of the University of Copenhagen investigate how the rising number of managers with business degrees affects wages within workplaces in both the United States and Denmark—a research strategy that isolates policy and institutional landscapes across two different countries. The authors find that a greater proportion of managers with business degrees is associated with lower worker wages.

Acemoglu He and le Maire also are able to causally estimate this impact by looking at scenarios in which there is a retirement or death and a manager without a business degree is replaced by another person with a business degree. In the United States the authors find that the appointment of a manager with a business degree results in a 6 percent decline in wages in the following 5 years. The authors estimate that these dynamics explain 15 percent of the slowdown in wage growth and 20 percent of the decline in the labor share in the United States since 1980.

What’s more the increasing preponderance of managers with business degrees is not associated with higher firm output or productivity.

Policy proposals to return bargaining power to workers and foster broadly shared economic growth

Most evidence shows that efforts to maximize shareholder value do not just hurt workers’ labor market outcomes and lead to an increase in economic inequality but also do little to increase firm profitability. Further research suggests the shift toward shareholder primacy is a drag on economic growth. In Equitable Growth-funded research for example Florian Ederer of Yale University and Bruno Pellegrino of the University of Maryland find that common ownership—an ownership arrangement where a few institutional investors hold investment positions in a number of competing firms—reduces competition between firms similar to monopolization and decreases overall economic welfare across the U.S. economy.

The promise of broadly shared growth in a market-based economy can only be realized in a legal economic and institutional context that supports worker power to offset the inefficient tendency toward inequality and wealth-hoarding under financial capitalism. In the current environment of shareholder primacy research shows that these tendencies result in declining wages deadweight loss and a distorted distribution of economic value.

Measures to reinforce countervailing worker power include policies that will restore the strength and presence of unions in the United States. The decline of unions is associated with a variety of deleterious impacts for the U.S. economy. Reforming labor law to make worker organizing easier—such as provisions in the Protecting the Right to Organize or PRO Act that protect the right to strike ensure union elections are fair and make it harder for companies to misclassify their workers as independent contractors—would help restore union density.

Another effective measure is to increase worker and union representation on corporate boards. Research by Simon Jäger of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Benjamin Schoefer of the University of California Berkeley and Jörg Heining of the German Institute for Employment Research finds that so-called co-determination—or when workers have secured spots on company boards—does not diminish firm performance but does in fact diminish the likelihood that a firm will outsource work without impacting wage levels.

Sectoral bargaining where multiemployer groups bargain with unions for an entire employment sector in a specific location and wage boards that include union representation would also provide a much-needed counterbalance to corporate strategies that push managers to cut wages and exploit workers.

Another piece of the puzzle for restoring balance in the economy and ensuring robust broadly shared growth is reforms that diminish the exploitative power of finance. This would set the U.S. economy on a path toward a system of so-called stakeholder capitalism in which corporate strategy is reoriented toward the interests of all relevant stakeholders including workers suppliers and local communities.

To accomplish these goals limiting stock buybacks and establishing board fiduciary duty to stakeholders would help reshape corporate governance away from shareholder primacy. This in turn may help ensure that workers can share in the value they create as well as offset the potential for negative externalities such as environmental costs.

These proposals would go a long way to fostering equitable economic growth in the United States by boosting worker power and shifting corporate strategies away from policies that center shareholder primacy."

Currently the Minnetonka-based carrier is selling the coverage in 18 states through government-run health exchange marketplaces that were launched under the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA).

UnitedHealthcare confirmed in an email to the Star Tribune that it hopes to start doing so in four more states next year — Kansas Mississippi Missouri and Ohio.

""We will add these markets pending regulatory approval"" a company spokesman wrote.

UnitedHealthcare mentioned the 2023 growth plan in a Sept. 1 notice to health care providers about new prior authorization codes that was reviewed by the Star Tribune.

Beginning in 2014 the ACA brought sweeping changes to the market where coverage is sold to individuals — typically people under age 65 who are self-employed or don't get health plan benefits from their employer.

The law created the health exchanges where consumers tap federal tax credits that discount premium costs and it also imposed requirements for comprehensive benefits.

In November 2015 UnitedHealthcare which is the nation's largest health insurer sent shock waves through the market with pessimistic comments about the product category from Stephen Hemsley the chief executive at the time of parent company UnitedHealth Group.

""We can't really subsidize a marketplace that doesn't appear at the moment to be sustaining itself"" Hemsley told investors.

The company's negative outlook was significant because the federal health law relies on competition among private insurers to control the cost of coverage.

With losses of $1.3 billion during a two-year period UnitedHealthcare decided to largely abandon the market. The company went from selling health plans through exchanges in 33 states during 2016 to just five states in 2017 and then two states in 2018.

Since then several states — including Minnesota — have taken steps to attract carriers to the market with government-funded reinsurance programs. As the market has stabilized carriers have started to see a path for profitable growth in selling ACA-compliant coverage to individuals.

In recent years Minnetonka-based Medica Bloomington-based Bright Health and others have significantly grown membership in the individual market across multiple state markets.

During the last two years individual market coverage has grown with enhanced federal tax credits for individuals under the American Rescue Plan Act. Those subsidies were extended by federal legislation this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3JldGFpbC9ob3ctc2lnbmlmeS1oZWFsdGgtZml0cy1jdnMtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1zdHJhdGVnedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Signify Health fits into CVS' healthcare strategy,"CVS Health has taken the first step in its bid to branch further into healthcare services with its acquisition of Signify Health executives said Tuesday.

CVS announced late Monday that it will buy home health company Signify in a deal valued at about $8 billion in cash. The retail healthcare giant beat out a number of competitors including big names like Amazon and UnitedHealth Group to snap up Signify.

Bringing Signify into the fold advances the company further into both the home health and the managed service organization (MSO) markets Sree Chaguturu M.D. CVS Health's chief medical officer told Fierce Healthcare. It also builds on the foundation CVS has built in retail health through its pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations.

""Our relationship with Signify Health helps us meaningfully advance that strategy in two of the three verticals MSO and home health so we're really excited about that"" he said.

Related CVS plans to make a major primary care play by the end of 2022

In addition to home health and value-based care CVS flagged primary care as a focus for its expansion efforts. On its second-quarter earnings call executives said that the company was eyeing a major play in the primary care market by the end of this year.

On a call with investors Tuesday morning CVS Health Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said that investors shouldn't read too deeply into the company's decision to first move forward with an acquisition in home health and value-based care. He said that CVS has focused on finding potential acquisition targets that are the right fit.

""It's far more important for us to find the right asset with the right scale the right tech and the right team"" Guertin said on the call.

CVS' scale and assets also put it in a strong position to support Signify Health's own growth goals as the company has a long history of offering payer-agnostic services Chaguturu added.

Signify is planning to be in 2.5 million homes this year and joining up with CVS enables it to accelerate that push Kyle Armbrester CEO of Signify Health told Fierce. When the deal closes Armbrester will stay on as CEO of Signify and he said that finding a place where the team could largely stay together was also key.

""We really view this accelerating our road map and it will multiply our ability to make a positive impact on consumers’ lives"" Armbrester said.

Both companies expect the merger to close in the first half of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaG9zcGljZW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDYvY3ZzLWhlYWx0aC10by1hY3F1aXJlLXNpZ25pZnktaGVhbHRoLWluLTgtYmlsbGlvbi1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Health to Acquire Signify Health in $8 Billion Deal,"CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) has agreed to purchase Signify Health (NYSE: SGFY) for a total transaction value of $8 billion.

Signify is a value-based care enablement company that concentrates on care in the home including home health and palliative care. CVS indicated that the transaction will lay the foundation for further expansion in home-based health care.

The massive deal follows a months-long bidding process that included Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) as prospective buyers among others.

“This transaction is a significant step forward in our strategy to enhance our care delivery for consumers and to be able to meet their needs when and where they want care and the home is increasingly part of that choice” CVS Health President and CEO Karen S. Lynch said in an investors conference call that followed the announcement. “Signify is a leader in value-based care with a rapidly growing provider ACO enablement business. They’re also a leader in health risk assessment which brings clinicians in the home to identify chronic conditions close gaps in care and address social determinants of health.”

Signify will remain payer-agnostic according to statements from CVS which also owns the insurance company Aetna.

The sale price amounts to $30.50 per share in cash.

Signify partners with payers and health systems to offer home-based care using proprietary analytics and technology platforms. The company’s complex care management program mirrors the interdisciplinary palliative care model including symptom management addressing psychosocial needs advance care planning and social determinants of health.

Signify has a presence in all 50 states and employs more than 10000 workers serving more than 2.5 million individuals in their homes.

“Signify Health’s mission is to build trusted relationships to make people healthier by using actionable intelligence to understand what’s really impacting outcomes and cost today” said Kyle Armbrester CEO of Signify Health. “As we carefully considered our long-term strategic options we determined that CVS Health is the ideal partner given its focus on expanding access to health services and helping consumers navigate to the best sites of care.”

Private equity funds affiliated with New Mountain Capital own close to 60% of the common stock in Signify Health. Those funds have agreed to vote the shares they own in favor of the transaction. Signify Board Chair Matt Holt is also New Mountain’s president of private equity and managing director.

Armbrester will stay on as CEO after the transaction closes which is expected to occur during the first half of 2023. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Signify earned $246.2 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2022 up 16% from the same period in 2021.

The company last year launched its Transition to Home program designed to prevent readmissions by filling gaps in patient care and keep them in their homes. During its first year in operation for example the program identified more than 3000 social determinants of health gaps. In year one Transition to Home reduced 30-day hospital readmissions and 90-day readmissions by 13% Armbrester indicated in Q2 earnings.

The acquisition follows Signify’s decision in July to pull out of the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Bundled Payments for Care Improvement-Advanced (BPCI-A) program to refocus on expanding its home- and community-based services.

Sweetening the deal is the opportunity for CVS to leverage Signify’s tech platform including those developed by Accountable Care Organization (ACO) management firm Caravan Health. Signify acquired Caravan earlier this year for $25 million.

Lynch indicated that these capabilities will allow CVS and its new assets to design new care models and help navigate patients to the best “site of care.”

“Signify’s recently acquired Caravan platform enables physicians to take risks and equips them with tools to provide value-based care” Lynch said in the conference call. “By acquiring Signify’s Hometown platform we gain a foundation for future expansion of home health care delivery.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWx1bmRyZXBvcnQub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktcHVyY2hhc2VzLXNxdWVlemUtcGh5c2ljaWFuLW93bmVkLXByYWN0aWNlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Private Equity Purchases Squeeze Physician-Owned Practices,"A study from OHSU and other institutions questions whether private equity ownership drives up cost without improving care.

Private equity firms that buy physician-owned practices appear to be squeezing greater profits out of the businesses suggests research by a group of doctors including an assistant professor at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.

The researchers examined 578 physician practices specializing in dermatology gastroenterology and ophthalmology that were bought by private equity firms across the nation from 2016 to 2020.

After they were bought by private equity firms the clinics saw more patients and billed more for visits from a large commercially insured population according to the study published in JAMA Health Forum.

For-profit companies have long owned a big slice of the U.S. health care sector but the growing role of private equity firms — and the steep financial returns they seek — has alarmed some researchers. The new study shifts the focus beyond hospitals and larger chains to look at doctor offices.

“The reason this is of concern to patients and policymakers is that private equity is often driven by profit margins of 20% or more” said senior author Dr. Jane Zhu an assistant professor of medicine at OHSU. “To do that they have to generate higher revenues or reduce costs. Increasing private equity in these physician practices may be a symptom of the continuing corporatization of health care.”

“Private-equity ownership of physician practices has added a distinctly private and market-driven influence to the broader trends in corporate consolidation of physicians by health systems and insurers” the researchers concluded. “This study contributes evidence for potential overutilization and higher spending of care that will be important for policymakers to monitor.”

Whether the purchase of physician practices by private equity firms has hurt or helped patient health is unclear the researchers said.

Zhu said more information is needed about how private equity impacts practices.

An OHSU news release noted that Oregon has launched a program to evaluate large proposed mergers and purchases in the health care sector to try to ensure they don’t drive up health care costs or cut health care quality. While all for-profit entities seek a return private equity firms which don’t publicly report their financial results have been singled out as excessively profit-focused.

Under the private equity system large investors such as pension funds or super-wealthy individuals assign their cash to a private equity firm which buys up profitable or promising looking businesses across a range of sectors.

Unlike publicly traded for-profit companies private equity firms are not traded on public stock exchanges. The federal Securities & Exchange Commission regulates both publicly traded companies and private equity firms but the rules and financial disclosure requirements the SEC imposes on publicly traded companies are far more extensive.

In Oregon the health care sector remains largely in the hands of nonprofit entities — large nonprofit hospital and clinic systems such as Providence Health & Services Legacy Health and PeaceHealth; and health insurers such as PacificSource Providence and Kaiser Permanente.

But for-profit firms — including some private equity firms — play a role.

In Oregon only two of the state’s 62 general hospitals are owned by for-profit entities. One of those Willamette Valley Medical Center in McMinnville is owned by a private equity firm New York City-based Apollo Global Management. The hospital is part of Apollo’s LifePoint Health a nationwide system with 265 facilities including 62 hospitals.

Private Equity Buys In To Oregon Hospice

Earlier this summer Oregon’s new health care merger review program approved a private equity firm’s purchase of two hospice facilities in the state as part of a multi-billion nationwide transaction.

The approval came despite fears voiced by three advocacy groups that the new majority owner New York City-based private equity firm Falcon Hospice LP might pursue cost cutting that could harm the care of patients at the Kindred Hospice facilities in Lake Oswego and Salem.

The deal met state requirements because Falcon said it will not lower the quality of care the Oregon Health Authority said. The state said it would monitor the two facilities at intervals over a period of five years for any decline in services.

Under the deal Falcon bought a 60% KAH Hospice a nationwide chain of 441 hospice community care and palliative facilities that is wholly owned by Humana a giant publicly traded Kentucky-based health care insurer and provider.

The Chicago-based nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project urged Oregon to reject Falcon’s deal saying the entry of private-equity firms into the for-profit hospice industry would worsen the industry’s problems.

Other For-Profit Expansions In Oregon

In their study the researchers for the JAMA paper found an increase in the overall number of patients seen in the physician clinics bought by private equity firms. The study reviewed commercial insurance claims data that showed an increased share of visits longer than 30 minutes even though the complexity of cases remained similar to cases before acquisition.

“These billing patterns could mean more efficient documentation of services provided or it could mean up-coding or up-charging insurance companies to make more money” Zhu said.

The role of publicly traded for-profit companies in health care has also drawn scrutiny.

Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services owner of 335 behavioral health hospitals nationwide spent years trying to win state approval to build a 100-bed psychiatric hospital in Wilsonville. Critics said the publicly traded company was seeking to serve profitable commercially insured patients while minimizing service to low-income Medicaid-insured patients a claim UHC denied. UHC this year withdrew its application after the state approved a 50-bed facility with requirements that the hospital serve specified volumes of low-income patients. In Oregon UHC already owns Cedar Hills Hospital a psychiatric hospital in Portland.

But for-profit companies continue to see opportunities in health care. The nation’s largest health care insurance company Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group is rapidly buying up physician practices and other medical providers. Analysts say the publicly traded company is looking for better profits to offset slackening returns on its insurance business.

In recent years UnitedHealth has bought at least two Oregon clinic networks: Oregon Medical Group in Eugene-Springfield and GreenField Health in Portland. UnitedHealth bought GreenField Health last year and Oregon Medical Group in late 2020. Combined the two systems have about 120 doctors and other clinicians at 11 locations.

In recognition of growing mental health concerns among children recent policy measures including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the American Rescue Plan Act provide pathways to support school-based mental health services for students. These policy actions aim to expand mental health care in schools – a setting that is more easily accessible by children and adolescents.

In this analysis we explore the landscape of mental health services in schools during the 2021-2022 school year barriers to offering services and how recent policies facilitate the expansion of school-based mental health care. We draw upon data from the new 2022 School Pulse Panel a study by the National Center for Education Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau that surveys staff of public primary middle high and combined-grade schools monthly on a variety of topics including school mental health services.

Background

School-based mental health services can improve access to care allow for early identification and treatment of mental health issues and may be linked to reduced absenteeism and better mental health outcomes. School-based services can also reduce access barriers for underserved populations including children from low-income households and children of color.

The delivery of mental health services in schools has evolved over time and continues to vary across schools. Some students access in-person mental health services at schools or near campus while others access services through telehealth. Service delivery can range from a single provider (who is not necessarily a licensed mental health professional) to a team of providers including psychologists social workers and academic or guidance counselors. A growing number of schools have also integrated social and emotional learning and other mental health literacy programs into their curriculum.

Despite the growth of school-based mental health services challenges persist including mental health provider shortages and inadequate funding.

Landscape of School-Based Mental Health Services

SERVICES OFFERED

Most public schools offer mental health services to students although utilization remains unclear. In the 2021-2022 school year 96% of public schools reported offering at least one type of mental health service to their students. As shown in Figure 1 the most frequently offered services are:

Individual-based interventions like one-on-one counseling or therapy (84% of public schools)

Case management or coordinating mental health services (70%) and

Referrals for care outside of the school (66%).

Only one-third (34%) of schools provide outreach services which includes mental health screenings for all students. These universal behavioral health screenings are considered a best practice and allow for schools to better identify all students with needs and tailor services to their specific student population. However many schools do not offer these screenings often due to a lack of resources or difficulty accessing providers to conduct screenings burden of collecting and maintaining data and/or a lack of buy-in from school administrators.

Approximately one out of five schools (17%) reported offering mental health services through telehealth during the 2021-2022 school year. While telehealth became a more widely used pathway to delivering health care during the pandemic a growing number of schools already began providing care through telehealth prior to the pandemic. The utilization of telehealth in all school-based health care is more common in rural areas – where provider shortages and transportation issues are more prevalent – and can reduce barriers to care for underserved students.

PROVIDER TYPES

Staffing models for school-based mental health care can vary across schools. Sixty-eight percent of public schools have a school or district-employed licensed mental health professional on staff and 51% employ an external mental health provider (Figure 1). While general or academic school counselors can provide mental health services to students as well they typically focus on short-term and preventive services and are not equipped to offer long-term care. The School Pulse Panel does not include information on the number of mental health providers on staff; however other research indicates that most schools do not meet the recommended ratios of counselors and/or psychologists to students.

Other school staff particularly teachers often play a role in identifying students with mental health needs and linking them to care. However research prior to the pandemic found that many teachers did not receive adequate training to identify and provide support to students with mental health needs. Since the pandemic began nearly three out of four schools (73%) have reported providing trainings and professional development to staff in order to help them identify growing mental health concerns among school students. However data on the impact of these trainings is unavailable and it is unclear what share of schools were providing trainings prior to the pandemic.

FUNDING

School mental health services are supported through multiple sources of funding at the national state and local level. As shown in Figure 1 in the 2021-2022 school year just over half of schools reported receiving funding for mental health services from district or school funds (57%) or federal grants or programs (52%) while smaller shares of schools reported funding from partnerships with organizations (37%) or state programs (32%). At the federal level many schools receive support through the Department of Education – including grant programs and the Every Student Succeeds Act – and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Schools may receive funds through Medicaid in several ways including reimbursement for medically necessary services that are part of a student’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP)reimbursement for eligible health services for students with Medicaid coverage and for some administrative services. Additionally many state budgets appropriate funds toward mental health services while fewer states allocate funds directly in their school funding models.

CHANGES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC

In response to growing mental health concerns during the pandemic 67% of schools reported increasing mental health services offered to students (Figure 2). However fewer than half of schools (41%) reported hiring new staff to focus on students’ mental health and well-being since the pandemic began (Figure 2). The inability of some schools to staff up despite growing mental health challenges may be due to budget constraints coupled with limited availability of mental health professionals.

In light of the pandemic 27% of schools added classes for their students on social emotional and mental well-being since March 2020 (Figure 2). Additionally for the 2021-2022 school year 28% of schools made changes to their academic calendar to address mental health concerns for both staff and students. Examples of these changes include providing additional days off and allocating time to focus on mental wellness during the school day. Several states have introduced or passed measures allowing students excused absences related to mental health.

Barriers to School-Based Mental Health Services

During the 2021-2022 school year approximately half of schools reported they strongly (12%) or moderately agreed (44%) they could effectively provide mental health services to all students in need. Meanwhile a third of schools reported they strongly (10%) or moderately disagreed (23%) that they could effectively provide mental health services and 11% neither agreed or disagreed. Among the 88% of schools that did not strongly believe they could effectively provide mental health services to students in need the most reported limitations involved mental health provider shortages – 61% cited insufficient staff coverage and 57% cited a lack of access to providers (Figure 3). Schools have faced provider shortages for years but this issue has recently received more attention in light of growing mental health concerns among children. Many schools do not meet recommended ratios for psychologists to students (500:1) or counselors to students (250:1). Going into the 2022-2023 school year 19% of public schools have vacancies for mental health professionals. Among schools with these vacancies 84% reported it will be somewhat or very difficult to fill these mental health positions.

Among school staff that did not strongly believe they could provide mental health services to all students in need during the 2021-2022 school year 48% cited inadequate funding as a barrier (Figure 3). Funding challenges for school mental health services have long existed. In order to provide and sustain services many schools use funding from multiple sources including at the national state and local levels as previously mentioned. However this presents several challenges as schools navigate varying specifications of how to utilize funds based on the source and changes to funding streams over time.

How Have Recent Policies Addressed School-Based Mental Health Services?

The American Rescue Plan Act and recent state policies have provided pathways to expand mental health and wellness services in schools. In 2021 the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was passed and designed to provide relief from the continued impacts of the pandemic. A portion of funds from the ARPA ($122.8 billion) were allocated for the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) and many states are using some of these funds to support school-based mental health care. Some ways states and schools are using these funds include growing the school mental health provider workforce (e.g. funding positions for mental health counselors and social workers in schools) partnering with community-based mental health agencies to expand access to care for students providing trainings for school staff and providing technical assistance for school mental health programs. However one study has also found that lower-income schools and schools in rural areas are less likely to use ARPA funds toward school-based mental health services than their counterparts. Some schools (22%) reported using ARPA funds to create new staff positions during the 2021-2022 school year although a large share of schools did not know (37%) if funds were used for these purposes. Among the schools that did use ARPA funds toward new staffing 35% reported using a portion of these funds for school mental health professionals (e.g. psychologists and social workers). The ARPA also included funding to support students with disabilities and youth experiencing homelessness. Separately some states have passed legislation to address growing mental health concerns including the implementation of suicide prevention programs and mental health screening programs.

The recently passed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act also allocates funds to support school-based mental health services. In response to increasing gun violence and mass shootings the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was signed into law in June 2022. This legislation focuses on both gun reform and youth mental health including provisions to support and expand school-based mental health services highlighted below.

Provisions from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act

Supporting and Expanding School-Based Mental Health Services Provision Description Expansion of School-Based Health Care Through Medicaid Requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide states with resources and guidance on how to support and expand school-based health care including mental health services. Guidance may include best practices for payment and reimbursement of school-based services and utilization of telehealth. These provisions include $50 million in planning grants for states. Expansion of School-Based Mental Health Providers Allocates $500 million each for the School Based Mental Health Services Grant Program and the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration Grant Program. These grant programs will allow for school districts with demonstrated need to increase the number of mental health providers in schools and provide training. A portion of these funds will be disbursed beginning in August 2022. Improving School Climate Allocates $1 billion towards keeping students healthy and safe through a number of programs including crisis intervention suicide prevention mentoring and drug and violence prevention. School Safety Allocates $300 million over 5 years through the STOP School Violence Act. Funds should be used toward school violence prevention and providing training to school staff. Funds cannot be used for training or providing school personnel with dangerous weapons. Trauma Support Allocates $28 million over 4 years for schools to provide trauma care to students in need. Care will be provided through Project Aware. Other Youth Mental Health Provisions Additional provisions that address children’s mental health but are separate from school-based care include improving the implementation of Medicaid’s Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit across states increasing access to behavioral health services through telehealth under Medicaid/CHIP mental health training for pediatric providers and increasing access to community-based mental health services.

Despite recent increased attention and resources for school-based mental health services challenges remain. In May 2022 large shares of public school staff reported that they strongly agree the pandemic has negatively impacted students’ behavioral development (39%) and socioemotional development (45%). It is unclear how schools will adequately address these impacts as they continue to face challenges including mental health provider shortages burnout among school staff disparities by race and ethnicity in access to school services and long-term sustainability issues. Addressing these challenges and improving access to school-based mental health services may help mitigate rising mental health concerns among youth.

To promote mental health in the Region Member countries of WHO South-East Asia Region today adopted the Paro Declaration committing to Universal Access to People-centered Mental Health Care and Services.



“There is no health without mental health. Increasing investments in mental health including for preventive and promotive services at the primary care level reduces treatment costs and increases productivity employment and quality of life” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh Regional Director WHO South-East Asia Region.



The Paro Declaration was adopted at the Ministerial Roundtable on addressing mental health through primary care and community engagement on day two of the ongoing Seventy-Fifth Session of the WHO South-East Asia Regional Committee Session.



“The Declaration urges Member countries to develop and implement multisectoral policies across the life-course to address mental health risks and reduce treatment gaps exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that mental health services reach all those in need close to where they live without financial hardship” the Regional Director said.



As part of the Declaration Member countries agreed to develop country-specific targets to achieve universal primary care-oriented mental health services and mainstream mental health in policy planning implementation and evaluation.



The Paro Declaration also calls for increased funding for community-based mental health networks and continuous supply of medicines and rehabilitation including occupational therapy for everyone who needed them and strengthening of data gathering and reporting implementation research and performance monitoring to ensure context-sensitive improvement of mental health systems.



Around 1 in 7 people live with a mental health condition in the South-East Asia Region. The personal and economic distress and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have widened the gaps in addressing mental health challenges which include scarcity of human resources low investment stigma inadequate prevention and promotion programmes paucity of data and lack of services in primary care settings.



The Declaration calls for ensuring an effective and comprehensive response to the mental health needs by establishing evidence-based and rights-oriented community mental health networks and systematically planning for the deinstitutionalization of care for people with severe mental disorders.



Member countries committed to prioritizing fiscal space for health and universal health coverage secure adequate investment for mental health services at the primary and secondary level and mobilizing required additional resources in partnership with local and international stakeholders.



Strengthening capacity of primary health care system is the foundation for provision of mental health services and progress towards UHC the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and the targets of WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030. Member countries committed to expanding specialized and non-specialized mental health workforce by identifying new cadres of health-care personnel who are especially trained equipped and skilled for the delivery of mental health services at the primary care level and work as part of multidisciplinary teams within the health sector.



Community empowerment and active engagement of people with lived experience helps reduce stigma and discrimination against people with mental disorders family members and caregivers.



Strengthening national and subnational level prevention and promotion programmes helps achieve the well-being of all by addressing suicide and self-harm substance use consumption of harmful digital entertainment bullying and parenting issues. Member countries committed to lead the multisectoral mental health response by guiding and harmonizing the social education development and economic sectors to address determinants of mental health such as poverty lack of education social isolation emergencies and impact of climate change and set country-specific targets to achieve universal primary care-oriented mental health services.



Several Member countries in the Region have already taken action to strengthen policies plans laws and services to improve the mental health of populations. Replicating and scaling up successful models and innovative interventions harnessing digital technologies and telemedicine to improve access to services and capacity-building of health-care workers and using evidence and data for programme improvement will help make the Region withstand future mental health impacts exacerbated by humanitarian emergencies climate change and economic downturns.



WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia has promulgated several important resolutions related to mental health. These include alcohol consumption control – policy options; noncommunicable diseases mental health and neurological disorders; comprehensive and coordinated efforts for the management of autism spectrum disorders and developmental disabilities; and SEA Regional Action Plan to implement the Global Strategy to reduce harmful use of alcohol.



WHO will continue to support in strengthening countries in reorienting primary care for mental health through task-sharing; capacity-building for mental health and psychosocial support during emergencies and establishing a regional knowledge and training hub for coordinating evidence and data generation prioritizing areas of research and facilitating exchange of experiences based on identified needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWx1bmRyZXBvcnQub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktcHVyY2hhc2VzLXNxdWVlemUtcGh5c2ljaWFuLW93bmVkLXByYWN0aWNlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Private Equity Purchases Squeeze Physician-Owned Practices,"A study from OHSU and other institutions questions whether private equity ownership drives up cost without improving care.

Private equity firms that buy physician-owned practices appear to be squeezing greater profits out of the businesses suggests research by a group of doctors including an assistant professor at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.

The researchers examined 578 physician practices specializing in dermatology gastroenterology and ophthalmology that were bought by private equity firms across the nation from 2016 to 2020.

After they were bought by private equity firms the clinics saw more patients and billed more for visits from a large commercially insured population according to the study published in JAMA Health Forum.

For-profit companies have long owned a big slice of the U.S. health care sector but the growing role of private equity firms — and the steep financial returns they seek — has alarmed some researchers. The new study shifts the focus beyond hospitals and larger chains to look at doctor offices.

“The reason this is of concern to patients and policymakers is that private equity is often driven by profit margins of 20% or more” said senior author Dr. Jane Zhu an assistant professor of medicine at OHSU. “To do that they have to generate higher revenues or reduce costs. Increasing private equity in these physician practices may be a symptom of the continuing corporatization of health care.”

“Private-equity ownership of physician practices has added a distinctly private and market-driven influence to the broader trends in corporate consolidation of physicians by health systems and insurers” the researchers concluded. “This study contributes evidence for potential overutilization and higher spending of care that will be important for policymakers to monitor.”

Whether the purchase of physician practices by private equity firms has hurt or helped patient health is unclear the researchers said.

Zhu said more information is needed about how private equity impacts practices.

An OHSU news release noted that Oregon has launched a program to evaluate large proposed mergers and purchases in the health care sector to try to ensure they don’t drive up health care costs or cut health care quality. While all for-profit entities seek a return private equity firms which don’t publicly report their financial results have been singled out as excessively profit-focused.

Under the private equity system large investors such as pension funds or super-wealthy individuals assign their cash to a private equity firm which buys up profitable or promising looking businesses across a range of sectors.

Unlike publicly traded for-profit companies private equity firms are not traded on public stock exchanges. The federal Securities & Exchange Commission regulates both publicly traded companies and private equity firms but the rules and financial disclosure requirements the SEC imposes on publicly traded companies are far more extensive.

In Oregon the health care sector remains largely in the hands of nonprofit entities — large nonprofit hospital and clinic systems such as Providence Health & Services Legacy Health and PeaceHealth; and health insurers such as PacificSource Providence and Kaiser Permanente.

But for-profit firms — including some private equity firms — play a role.

In Oregon only two of the state’s 62 general hospitals are owned by for-profit entities. One of those Willamette Valley Medical Center in McMinnville is owned by a private equity firm New York City-based Apollo Global Management. The hospital is part of Apollo’s LifePoint Health a nationwide system with 265 facilities including 62 hospitals.

Private Equity Buys In To Oregon Hospice

Earlier this summer Oregon’s new health care merger review program approved a private equity firm’s purchase of two hospice facilities in the state as part of a multi-billion nationwide transaction.

The approval came despite fears voiced by three advocacy groups that the new majority owner New York City-based private equity firm Falcon Hospice LP might pursue cost cutting that could harm the care of patients at the Kindred Hospice facilities in Lake Oswego and Salem.

The deal met state requirements because Falcon said it will not lower the quality of care the Oregon Health Authority said. The state said it would monitor the two facilities at intervals over a period of five years for any decline in services.

Under the deal Falcon bought a 60% KAH Hospice a nationwide chain of 441 hospice community care and palliative facilities that is wholly owned by Humana a giant publicly traded Kentucky-based health care insurer and provider.

The Chicago-based nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project urged Oregon to reject Falcon’s deal saying the entry of private-equity firms into the for-profit hospice industry would worsen the industry’s problems.

Other For-Profit Expansions In Oregon

In their study the researchers for the JAMA paper found an increase in the overall number of patients seen in the physician clinics bought by private equity firms. The study reviewed commercial insurance claims data that showed an increased share of visits longer than 30 minutes even though the complexity of cases remained similar to cases before acquisition.

“These billing patterns could mean more efficient documentation of services provided or it could mean up-coding or up-charging insurance companies to make more money” Zhu said.

The role of publicly traded for-profit companies in health care has also drawn scrutiny.

Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services owner of 335 behavioral health hospitals nationwide spent years trying to win state approval to build a 100-bed psychiatric hospital in Wilsonville. Critics said the publicly traded company was seeking to serve profitable commercially insured patients while minimizing service to low-income Medicaid-insured patients a claim UHC denied. UHC this year withdrew its application after the state approved a 50-bed facility with requirements that the hospital serve specified volumes of low-income patients. In Oregon UHC already owns Cedar Hills Hospital a psychiatric hospital in Portland.

But for-profit companies continue to see opportunities in health care. The nation’s largest health care insurance company Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group is rapidly buying up physician practices and other medical providers. Analysts say the publicly traded company is looking for better profits to offset slackening returns on its insurance business.

In recent years UnitedHealth has bought at least two Oregon clinic networks: Oregon Medical Group in Eugene-Springfield and GreenField Health in Portland. UnitedHealth bought GreenField Health last year and Oregon Medical Group in late 2020. Combined the two systems have about 120 doctors and other clinicians at 11 locations.

As usual we are overbooked. There is no time to discuss any of the patients that would be seen that day in advance so I immediately head to an exam room to see my first patient with another newly minted medical student. Having not yet learned the basic physical exam skills I google “how to listen to lung sounds” on my way to the room.

The free clinic is located in a community primarily composed of immigrants who are largely uninsured or underinsured. Our patient does not speak English so I try my best to conduct the visit in Hindi my second language. The patient has a number of common risk factors for heart disease and communicates that she is having some discomfort in her chest so I need to rule out the possibility of a heart attack. When I begin asking questions for nonclassical heart attack symptoms I realize I do not know the word for “heartburn.” I settle for motioning towards my stomach and asking “Any pain?” I hope she understands because we don’t have an interpreter on hand. “Free” means just me.

Another patient I see has uncontrolled diabetes. He needs to have his A1C measured but the phlebotomist is not in today and there is no one available to draw blood. He also needs insulin which he cannot afford but insulin is not one of the seven medications the clinic has stocked for distribution. I leave him with an unsatisfying “Please come back when the phlebotomist is in.” I am not sure how strongly I should insist that he return. Once we get his A1C checked which I fully expect to be elevated we will have nothing to offer him. “Free” means a diagnosis but not treatment.

One of the first things you learn as a medical student is the four universally accepted principles of health care ethics. Of them the one that applies to more than just the individual patient is justice tasking health care workers with the fair and equitable distribution of resources. While my classroom experience taught me to strive for justice my clinical experience has already demonstrated that justice is aspirational at best.

Downtown the General Internal Medicine Clinic at the academic medical center affiliated with my school practices the medicine you see on television. There are groups of health care providers huddled around monitors having spirited conversations about patients making long lists of differential diagnoses ordering various tests to narrow their thinking and referring patients out to specialists to ensure nothing is overlooked in the patient’s care.

Here clinic starts with the full team reviewing the patients on the schedule. Each patient is first seen by a medical assistant who records their heart rate temperature blood pressure and reason for visit. I then go in with an MS3 to examine the patient doing as much as I am comfortable with before they take over. We step out and finalize our assessment and plan to present to the attending physician. She comes in examines the patient herself and reviews the findings and recommended course of action with them. If indicated lab work can easily be completed across the hall on their way out. Unbeknownst to the patient by the time they leave their care has been discussed multiple times.

Clearly the care delivery model is very different at the free clinic where I volunteer. Free clinics supported by volunteers and donations — distinct from Federally Qualified Health Centers funded by the government — help fill the health care gap that the uninsured experience. An analysis of patients at Grace Medical Home in Orlando Florida showed that 58.5% of patients come to their clinic because they can’t afford insurance premiums. Before finding the clinic 80% were unsure how to access medical care or where to go for help.

Student-driven clinics allow for low operating costs and are a popular model for free clinics. More than 75% of medical schools have associated free clinics with ~60% of medical students at these schools volunteering there at some point in their training. These clinics do provide significant benefits to patients. The United Community Clinic a student-run clinic with an annual budget of less than $50000 estimated that their preventative services avoided future morbidity and mortality that would have cost $850000.

While free clinics have a significant impact on a population that critically lacks access to health care they are by no means enough. Our health care system strives to be just but offers some patients care from world-renowned physicians and facilities while others spend most of their visit with first-year medical students who cannot always speak their language fully assess them or help them get the medications they need.

Until our health care system evolves to provide universal coverage justice will always be aspirational. I cannot offer a path to get there or a solution that will lead to equitable distribution of medical resources. I can only remember the patients from the free clinic who allowed me to practice exam techniques for the first time and patiently waited as I fumbled through visits in their native language.

The small piece of their interaction with the health care system that I can influence is the quality of care they receive at free clinics. As an attending I hope to continue volunteering providing expert care to patients and more robust support to learners. Free clinics mold many medical students during their training years largely because of the increased responsibility they are able to take at an earlier stage. If we as attendings share a small amount of our time with free clinics we will not only give back to the patients who contributed so much to our success but also make our piece of the health care system a little more just.

With Canada’s health-care system “in crisis” as described by many front-line workers there is a renewed push towards leaning on private facilities to ease the pressure on public hospitals. In Ontario which is grappling with staffing shortages temporary emergency room closures and surgical backlogs more publicly covered surgeries will be performed at private clinics Health Minister Sylvia Jones announced last month. That announcement has reignited a long-standing debate over privatization of the Canadian health-care system with other provinces weighing their options. While some experts consider privatization a possible solution to staffing shortages and long wait times others see it as a threat to public care. “Canada is the only country in the world where it is illegal to obtain private health insurance when there are long wait-lists. That surely says something” said Dr. Brian Day medical director of Cambie Surgery Centre in Vancouver and past president of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA). Day whose private clinic in Vancouver has been up and running since June 1996 has long been advocating for a parallel private system in the province. He launched a legal challenge to the B.C. Medicare Protection Act saying wait times in the public health system are too long and stopping patients from paying for those services outside the public system violates their rights. Advertisement 2:35 Code Blue: Canada experiencing shortage of family doctors In July the B.C. Court of Appeal dismissed the Vancouver surgeon’s challenge. However in their ruling the judges accepted that the act’s provisions “deprived some patients’ right to security of the person by preventing them from accessing private care when the public system had failed to provide timely medical treatment.” Days says the funding model needs to change in the country adding that the “state-run monopoly” is killing Canadians. “The promise was that we would have a universal system where everyone was treated but people are dying on wait-lists” he said. View image in full screen Dr. Brian Day medical director of the Cambie Surgery Centre in Vancouver. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck Currently in Canada the public sector pays for 75 per cent of the total health expenditures across the country while 25 per cent comes from the private pool according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Dr. Michael Rachlis public health physician and adjunct professor at the University of Toronto said privatization is not the solution as it creates inequalities costs more and compromises quality of care. “Privatization of anything would make no difference in the emergency room wait times next week or a year from now. It’s just zero difference. They’re completely different issues.” Eugene Litvak adjunct professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and president of the not-for-profit Institute for Health Care Optimization in Boston agrees. He said involving more private hospitals will not solve Canada’s nursing shortage problem and more money does not necessarily mean it will cut ER wait times. “What I think the Canadian health-care system is lacking is a scientific approach of what needs to be done to address multiple issues” he said. Litvak believes a “centralized” approach is needed at the federal and provincial levels that provides hospitals relief in the face of a crisis.

Canada vs. other countries Canada’s health-care system is lagging behind some other high-income nations according to some reports. A 2021 report by the Commonwealth Fund ranked Canada’s health-care system 10th overall out of 11 countries. Norway was top-ranked followed by the Netherlands Australia and the United Kingdom. The United States where health care is largely covered by private insurance was ranked last. Canada’s health-care system is “unique in the world” as it prohibits services by private insurance companies according to a 2003 report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. About two-thirds of the population have private health insurance according to the Commonwealth Fund. 3:12 Code Blue: Emergency rooms across Canada struggle with staff shortages However this only covers services that are excluded from the universal health coverage such as vision and dental care outpatient prescription drugs rehabilitation services and private hospital rooms. Advertisement Other developed countries offer more flexibility and options. In Australia which like Canada has a universal health-care system private health insurance may include coverage for hospital care general treatment or ambulance services. Australians also have the option to be treated as a private patient with 75 per cent fee coverage for hospital services. In Germany citizens who have the money can opt out of the country’s statutory health insurance and purchase “substitutive coverage.” Even the U.K. which has a revered universal health-care system offers private options. “Canada’s health system is performing badly alongside similar countries” said Day.

Where do the provinces stand? Health care falls under provincial jurisdiction in Canada but Rachlis believes provinces would be better off if the federal government had more control over how services are organized without interfering with the delivery of care. “If the provinces get a lot of money with no conditions they’re simply going to be mugged when they get back home and it’ll be more money for the same set of services and that’s not sustainable” he said. Ontario has taken the lead in the private-public debate. The province says it wants more integration between the public and private sectors to reduce pressure on the public system but has no plans to privatize it. In a sit-down interview with Global News last month the CEO of Ontario Health said the agency is pushing for more control of the private sector including which services it could perform the funding it would receive and collaboration with the public sector. “What we are saying is can we create one funding envelope so that you can’t create this scenario over here where an independent facility can just start doing more procedures” Matthew Anderson said. “We can control at a funding level how many they’re doing.” 2:15 CEO of Ontario Health speaks to Global News about private delivery of healthcare New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said “all options are on the table” when asked last month if the Maritime province will be adopting measures now being pursued in Ontario including hiking public funding for private health services. While Quebec’s government is already doing business with pharmacists doctors and family medicine group clinics to perform surgeries the province said it is listening to other types of services that the private sector could provide. “The private network must be complementary to the public network in our health system” said Marjaurie Cote-Boileau a spokesperson for Quebec’s Minister of Health and Social Services. Nova Scotia said it is “closely monitoring” discussions by other provinces on the impact and use of private providers to address pressures in the health-care system. “At this time it is premature to comment on our plan to improve access to healthcare in Nova Scotia beyond what has already been announced” Jenna MacQueen communications adviser in the Department of Health and Wellness told Global News in an emailed statement. Advertisement Since 2008 health authorities in Nova Scotia have contracted private clinics to address immediate needs in surgical care. 2:01 N.B. may start funding some procedures in clinic settings In Alberta publicly funded care has been leaning on independent providers amid the COVID-19 pandemic – and that helped cut wait times for cataract surgery nearly in half from 19 to 10 weeks last year according to the Health Ministry. “Contracting doesn’t compete with the public system it adds to it and complements it” Steve Buick a spokesperson for Alberta’s health minister said in an email to Global News. Saskatchewan announced last month that it was expanding third-party partners to alleviate surgical wait times but those services will continue to be publicly funded. Last year the province saw an increase in the percentage of surgeries completed by third-party operators accounting for 20 per cent of all surgeries. “These surgical procedures will remain publicly funded; however we must take steps to better engage all resources available and consider all options to meet public demands for service while working to expand capacity within our healthcare system” the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health said."

This is the reverse of what is happening in the investment world. Instead of “He Who Cannot Be Named” the acronym ESG is being said repeatedly and made the villain despite its limited impact particularly in the ETF space.

I came back last week from a vacation in England and realized that rarely a business day went by in August when the acronym ESG was not in the news or my Twitter feed in a divisive way. We had Florida and Texas ban companies for their ESG considerations; Strive launched an energy ETF to push back what it claimed was stakeholder capitalism by asset managers like BlackRock; asset manager Inspire dropped the word “ESG” from its suite of ETFs citing “flames of intolerance”; and my friends and fellow ETF nerds Nate Geraci and Eric Balchunas shared data that shows many popular ESG ETFs have a high correlation to the S&P 500 Index meaning the ETF performance was similar to the widely popular non-ESG strategies.

Before we dive in with some facts I should note that my VettaFi colleagues Karie Gordon and Dave Nadig wrote an excellent piece “Is ESG Screaming Into the Void.” The commentary starts by stating “Few topics are more polarizing at a cocktail party full of the investor class than anything related to environmental social or governance (ESG) informed investing.”

I waited till now to spell out what Voldemort – I mean ESG – stands for because the acronym’s overuse has masked what we are really talking about. When many people complain about ESG they focus solely on the Environmental (E) pillar particularly climate change but often nothing else.

The ESG ETF universe includes funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN A+) Invesco Solar ETF (TAN C+) and SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (SPYX A-) but also many other products. Indeed there are 186 ESG ETFs per VettaFi as of the end of August or approximately 6% of the universe. Many ETFs take company attributes tied to the Social or Governance pillars solely or in combination with Environmental traits into account.

Indeed eight of the ten largest ESG ETFs take a broad index-based approach including the IShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU A-) the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA A) and the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV A-). Other targeted ESG ETFs that focus beyond the Environmental pillar include the Global X S&P 500 Catholic Values ETF (CATH B+) the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE B-) and the WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-State Owned Enterprises Fund (XSOE A).

So what makes a fund an ESG one? Well most of the ETFs track an index that uses unique criteria. However the below is pulled from the MSCI index methodology showcasing the broad approach with ten notable themes and 35 key issues. Texas used MSCI’s ESG scoring to put together its fossil-fuel boycott list.

The themes used by MSCI include climate change pollution and waste human capital product liability and corporate behavior. Meanwhile the issues list consists of carbon emissions toxic emissions & waste health & safety of employees privacy & data security consumer financial protection business ethics board representation and others. Even within each pillar each company is scored for many attributes before being added to the portfolio; not just one focused on climate change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aXByYW5rcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL2otcC1tb3JnYW4tc2F5cy1ub3ctaXMtdGhlLXRpbWUtdG8tcHVsbC10aGUtdHJpZ2dlci1vbi1lbmVyZ3ktc3RvY2tzLWhlcmUtYXJlLTItbmFtZXMtdG8tY29uc2lkZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.P. Morgan Says Now Is the Time to Pull the Trigger on Energy Stocks; Here Are 2 Names to Consider - TipRanks.com,"Sounding a note of musical irony Van Morrison sang “My Mama told me there’d be days like this.” And in an distinctly unironic note top analysts may start saying the same thing. With rising inflation rising interest rates and a falling stock market we’re in for more volatile days like this.

Looking at the big picture from JPMorgan Dubravko Lakos-Bujas the firm’s global head of equity macro research notes the energy crisis – the natural gas shortages in Europe the high price of oil world-wide and the reduced global production. Second points out how energy stocks as a sector are well-placed for gains going forward.

“With no resolution to the current energy crisis in sight Energy sector remains in a particularly sweet spot with very attractive valuations strong fundamentals and significant improvement in quality… The sector should deliver strong relative growth and rising capital return at very cheap valuation while its balance sheet continues to strengthen. The sector’s strong fundamentals remain anchored to rising revenues and high profit margins” Lakos-Bujas opined.

Against this backdrop the JPMorgan stock analysts have picked up this thread and followed it to the logical conclusion: pulling the trigger the energy stocks that they see as winners going forward. We’ve used TipRanks’ database to call up the latest details on two of these JPM energy picks; here they are along with commentary from the analysts.

SM Energy Company (SM)

We’ll start with a Denver-based hydrocarbon exploration and production firm SM Energy. SM has focused its operations on two core areas in five counties of the state of Texas in the West Texas Midland Basin and in the South Texas Maverick Basin. The company has three rigs running in the Midland area and 2 in the Maverick area; while that sounds decidedly modest it’s important to remember that with horizontal drilling methods and fracking technology a hydrocarbon company can leverage one well or rig for high production.

A look at the numbers will tell that story. SM saw total production in 2Q22 of 13.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) or 146.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d). Of this 46% was oil and the balance was natural gas and natural gas liquids. The company’s high production numbers drove a robust 76% year-over-year increase in revenues which reached just over $992 million for the quarter.

The bottom line benefited too. SM’s profits started taking off in the second half of 2021 and in 2Q22 reached a total of $323.5 million or $2.19 per diluted common share. Year-over-year the EPS was up dramatically from just 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. SM’s strong revenues and earnings came along with record-level cash generation. The company generated $542.6 million in cash from operations and saw a free cash flow of $276.6 million.

According to JPMorgan analyst Zach Parham SM Energy is still at the beginning of good times for investors. Backing his view he writes “SM looks to keep its high-performing rigs and frac crews busy which we think was viewed more favorably vs a raise driven solely by inflation. The incremental activity should provide operational momentum into 2023 and is in addition to ~20 Permian wells that will be TIL’d in early 2023 after being drilled and partially completed in 2022.”

“We continue to believe SM’s 2023 capital efficiency is underappreciated… We estimate that SM will generate $1.07 B of FCF in FY23 (24% FCF yield) and we expect that a significant portion of that FCF could be set to come back to shareholders” the analyst added.

Parham doesn’t just write up an optimistic outlook; he backs it with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares and a $60 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of ~39% from current levels. (To watch Parham’s track record click here)

Overall SM holds a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus based on 6 Buys and 1 Hold and Sell each. The shares are priced at $43.26 and their $61.97 average target suggests a 43% one-year upside. (See SM stock forecast on TipRanks)

Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)

Next up is Valero Energy one of the major players in the North American Caribbean and UK refined fuels market. Valero operates 15 refineries in the US Canada and the UK along with 11 ethanol plants and a 50 megawatt wind farm. Valero’s business operates in three segments refining ethanol and renewable diesel. The company is the second largest corn ethanol producer on the global markets and the world’s second largest producer of renewable diesel.

Valero’s profits and earnings were rising through 2020 and 2021 and really took off in 2Q22. The company reported $51.6 billion in revenues up by 86% year-over-year and diluted EPS made an even more impressive y/y jump from 63 cents to $11.36. Adjusted net income attributable to stockholders totaled $4.6 billion for the quarter.

The company has been consistently returning funds to shareholders with a dividend of 98 cents per common share. The quarterly dividend payment has been held steady at it current level for nearly three years and its annualized rate of $3.92 per common share gives an above-average yield of 3.44%. Valero has a 9-year history of keeping reliable dividend payments.

In the eyes of JPMorgan analyst John Royall Valero’s record of strong fuel production and reliable capital return are key points for investor consideration.

“VLO put up record results in 2Q while management commentary suggests product market tightness will continue driven by reduced post-pandemic refining capacity and little sign of demand weakness at the wholesale level (despite broader data suggesting otherwise). Management was bullish on fundamentals going forward and believes cracks will be structurally higher in the next economic cycle than in previous cycles…. We now model $2.2B in buybacks for 2H22 and $3B annually in 2023+” Royall noted.

Royall goes on to give VLO shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a $148 price target that indicates a 30% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Royall’s track record click here)

Overall there are 13 recent analyst reviews on file for Valero Energy including 11 Buys 1 Hold and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s current trading price is $113.82 and the $142.85 average price target implies a 25.5% one-year gain from that level. (See Valero stock forecast on TipRanks)

Elijah Nouvelage (Reuters)

La estrategia comercial de Juul para seducir a los adolescentes le ha salido cara a la popular marca de cigarrillos electrónicos. La firma tendrá que pagar 4385 millones de dólares (442 millones de euros) a 33 estados de Estados Unidos así como a Puerto Rico como consecuencia de un acuerdo judicial alcanzado este martes entre ambas partes.

Los demandantes reclamaban responsabilidad en la adicción de menores de edad a sus productos de vapeo con alto contenido de nicotina. Entre las estrategias empleadas por Juul y denunciadas ante los tribunales se contaban la celebración de fiestas de lanzamiento el reparto de regalos y de muestras gratuitas y el empleo en redes sociales de modelos jóvenes para promocionar la mercancía. En Estados Unidos la edad legal para comprar estos productos es 21 años la misma que rige para el tabaco.

El pacto es solo una parada más en el viacrucis de la compañía que aún tiene pendiente nueve juicios por separado con otros tantos estados y se enfrenta a cientos de demandas personales de consumidores menores de edad de sus productos. Además la Agencia de Alimentación y Medicamentos de Estados Unidos (la FDA por sus siglas en inglés) prohibió el pasado mes de junio a Juul que comercializara sus dispositivos y cápsulas con sabor mentolado y a tabaco de Virginia (y cargas de nicotina de entre el 3% y el 5%). También obligó a la empresa la retirada de las partidas que se encontraban entonces en las tiendas.

Los 33 estados se unieron a Puerto Rico en 2020 en esta cruzada contra Juul. La demanda la lideraban Texas Oregón y Connecticut cuyo fiscal general William Tong ha publicado este martes un tajante comunicado: “Comercializaron implacablemente productos de vapeo para menores de edad manipularon su composición química para que les resultaran apetecibles pese a su inexperiencia emplearon un proceso de verificación de edad inadecuado y engañaron a los consumidores sobre el contenido de nicotina y la adicción de sus productos. Las consecuencias para la salud pública de esta mala praxis aún se desconocen del todo. Con este acuerdo hemos obtenido cientos de millones de dólares para ayudar a reducir el uso de nicotina y obligamos a Juul a aceptar una serie de términos cautelares estrictos para poner fin al marketing juvenil y tomar medidas enérgicas contra la venta a menores de edad” ha declarado Tong.

Cada Estado recibirá una cantidad diferente como parte de la compensación. A Connecticut le corresponden por ejemplo 162 millones de dólares. A Texas 428 millones. Su fiscal general Tom Paxton ha recordado que “el acuerdo también incluye fuertes restricciones de publicidad ventas y distribución” así como un reforzamiento de los protocolos de “verificación de la edad” de los compradores.

La compañía tiene entre seis y 10 años para hacer frente al pago. Cuanto más tarde en cumplir con él mayor será la cantidad que deberá desembolsar con un tope de 4766 millones de dólares (4812 millones de euros) si decidiera apurar hasta el final el plazo impuesto por el juez.

Juul también ha emitido un comunicado en el que define el acuerdo como una expresión de su “compromiso por resolver problemas pasados”. “[Sus términos] están alineados con nuestras prácticas comerciales actuales que comenzaron en el otoño de 2019 cuando decidimos reenfocar los objetivos de la empresa″.

Participada por Altria la dueña de Marlboro Juul irrumpió en el mercado apostando fuerte la baza de la tecnología y el diseño y logró que cundiera la rentable analogía de que vendían el “el iPhone de los vapeadores”. La compañía como el resto del sector se distinguió por dirigirse con especial interés a los jóvenes disfrutó al principio de la bonanza de la novedad de unos productos que ofrecían el señuelo de atajar el tabaquismo. También se benefició de un vacío legal que los legisladores tardaron tiempo en llenar.

Se podría hacer una estimación sobre el precio medio de las entradas a dividir entre el número total de espectadores pero no sería fiable al 100% con lo que estaríamos cometiendo un error en los ingresos totales.

No obstante hay que apuntar que hasta ahora -con los precios estipulados hasta la pasada Feria de San Isidro y vigentes durante los festejos de verano y corridas de este mes de septiembre- y haciendo un cálculo aproximado la recaudación en taquilla rondaría los 600.000 euros a plaza llena dinero a repartir entre los honorarios de los toreros ganaderos personal de plaza -unos 400 trabajadores en total- gastos del festejo canon de plaza (que la empresa gestora en este caso Plaza 1 tiene que pagar a la propietaria del coso la Comunidad de Madrid por la explotación del inmueble) y beneficios de la empresa gestora del coso venteño.

Pero a partir de este verano hay que tener en cuenta que los precios se han liberalizado en las entradas sueltas una medida que recogía el nuevo pliego de condiciones de explotación del coso del pasado concurso -algunas de las entradas sueltas suben hasta tres veces el precio que tenían antes-. Por tanto será difícil de saber -dado que el plazo de renovación de abonados comienza esta semana- la recaudación total de una plaza llena a partir de la próxima Feria de Otoño.

Ya hablamos que los honorarios de los toreros y ganaderos pueden subir considerablemente según la fecha en la que se anuncian; no es lo mismo acudir a Madrid un día de la Beneficencia que una tarde normal de San Isidro u Otoño. Es cierto que los toreros de mayor caché más o menos tienen unos cobros lineales es decir que oscilan poco mientras que otro tipo de toreros ya sean emergentes o triunfadores de la Feria verán modificados sus honorarios según la tarde y el cartel.

Con las ganaderías pasa igual: hay hierros que acuden a la primera plaza del mundo cobrando unos 60.000 euros en una tarde normal de Feria pero si el cartel pasa a ser de figuras y en una tarde de gran boato puede llegar a subir hasta oscilar entre los 80.000 euros y los 100.000 en algunos casos incluso superarlos.

Para acercarnos a los honorarios de ciertos toreros por actuación en una plaza de toros como Las Ventas. Durante la temporada 2018 con la polémica suscitada por Alejandro Talavante -pedía un aumento de 15.000 euros por tarde- el empresario de dicha plaza el productor Simón Casas salía al paso haciendo las siguientes declaraciones «Alejandro Talavante cobra en Madrid 240.000 euros por corrida lo que supone el 50% de la taquilla neta de Las Ventas. Eso es justamente lo que ganan las máxima figuras. La afición tiene que saber que eso es una economía insostenible que altera gravemente el futuro de la fiesta«."

(Photo by Ishara S Kodikara/AFP via Getty Images)

Civil unrest is on the rise around the world as governments struggle to cope with soaring inflation according to a new report.

Analysis by risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft suggests that out of 132 countries analysed 62 are likely to see their risk of civil unrest increase over the next two quarters.

Six of the ten countries with the highest probability of an increase in unrest are in Africa with Algeria Cameroon and Senegal set for a particularly difficult six months.

The Americas is set to be the worst affected region however. Of the 24 countries analysed 16 are forecast to see an increase in the risk of unrest including the US. The report suggests that the risk of civil unrest in Chile is likely to rise from 'high' to 'extreme' over the next six months.

Chile has been rocked by political and economic instability over the past three years. On 5 August voters in the Andean country overwhelmingly rejected the new constitution that had been proposed as a solution to the country’s recent turmoil.

A perfect storm for civil unrest

The report pins the rise in civil unrest on skyrocketing global food and energy prices with additional downside risk over the next six months from unexpectedly extreme weather or natural disasters.

The growing risk of instability comes at a time when many countries are already facing crises of governance. Over the past quarter according to Verisk Maplecroft’s analysis 101 of the 198 countries analysed saw an increase in the risk of civil unrest (compared with just 42 that saw a decrease). More countries have seen an increase in risk over the past three months than at any point since the index began in 2016.

“The resulting threat to economic activity and foreign investment comes at a bad time for businesses as they adapt to rising energy prices” says Torbjorn Soltvedt the report’s principal author.

“Potential disruption to operations and supply chains is a major concern for companies as is the potential to be associated with heavy-handed responses to unrest from affected governments.”

In December 2020 Verisk Maplecroft warned of a “new era of civil unrest” predicting that 75 countries would see an increase in their risk of civil unrest by August 2022. Their assessment has proven optimistic with 120 countries seeing an increase in risk since that report was issued.

Notably eight of the ten countries forecast for the largest increase in civil unrest over the next two quarters are middle-income countries: Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Egypt Georgia the Philippines Serbia Suriname and Zimbabwe.

Many middle-income countries are facing particularly severe stress as they struggle to maintain Covid-related stimulus measures. Global supply chain issues and a rise in commodity prices have since made such policies difficult to sustain leading to the need for painful austerity measures.

Verisk Maplecroft warns that these trends are likely to exacerbate the ongoing trend towards greater restrictions on free expression as governments struggle to contain dissent. Over the past two years 66 countries have seen free speech eroded according to Verisk Maplecroft’s research. Among those seeing significant tightening of restrictions are Chile and Sri Lanka both of which have suffered large-scale civil unrest in 2022.

The report warns that by limiting citizens’ ability to dissent peacefully crackdowns on civil liberties are likely to be counterproductive. “The most explosive civil unrest is likely to occur where avenues for dissent are narrowing and where the ability to shield populations from the rise in living costs are limited” says Soltvedt.

“Crucially this is also where investors are likely to rush for the exit first leaving the most vulnerable governments even less equipped to take measures to reduce the risk of civil unrest.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlaHJhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ3NjQzOC9NYW55LWluLUV1cm9wZS1oYXZlLXRvLXNraXAtbWVhbHMtdG8tY29wZS13aXRoLWVuZXJneS1jcmlzaXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Many in Europe have to skip meals to cope with energy crisis,"TEHRAN- There is serious and rising concern and outrage among the European public over the cost of living fueled by higher energy prices and approaching winter.

The public despair in Europe is being directed at government policies as energy costs skyrocket out of control ahead of the chilly winter season. The risks of civil unrest including street protests and demonstrations in Europe’s richest nations is rising a risk consultancy firm says.

According to Verisk Maplecroft’s principal analyst Torbjorn Soltvedt Germany and Norway are among the developed economies witnessing disruptions to everyday life because of labour actions something already seen in the United Kingdom.

Verisk's latest report on its civil unrest index which assesses the risk of disruption to business caused by the mobilisation of societal groups finds more than 50 percent of the countries covered experienced an increase in mass mobilisations risk the highest on the company’s records.

""Over the winter it wouldn't come as a surprise if some of the developed nations in Europe start to see more serious forms of civil unrest"" Soltvedt says.

More in Common a non-profit organization has asked the views more than 7000 people in France Germany Poland and the UK. The polls show the severity of the crisis.

A majority expressed their concern of social unrest over the coming months because of rising inflation spearheaded by the energy crisis. In all four countries surveyed people said the cost of living is now the most important issue facing their country.

""Many are already struggling to cope; having to draw from savings or skip meals particularly among disengaged and low-trust segments of the population… the vast majority believe this won't be a short crisis with many seeing no end in sight."" said a report from More in Common.

The survey points out that Europeans have lost confidence in their governments' ability to handle the crisis. Few expect rising inflation to end any time soon with over one in three people surveyed uncertain that it will ever end.

Workers across the UK are continuing to strike demanding higher wages. According to the trade union Unite some 1600 bus drivers in London used the August bank holiday weekend between 27 and 28 August to strike following similar strike action the previous weekend.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham says “the two words that unite all the individual strikes taking place are ‘pay cuts’. Workers are simply no longer prepared to accept poverty wages especially when they know employer after employer is guilty of rampant profiteering.”

She adds that “there could be hundreds of disputes involving tens of thousands of workers over the coming months if employers continue to offer real terms wage cuts presented as pay increases. Graham also warns “It’s time to stop telling workers to pay the price for inflation and instead do something to tackle excessive profiteering.

British rail workers are set to stage a fresh round of strikes on September 15 and 17 in a dispute over pay jobs and conditions the National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) says.

The RMT says over 40000 of its members will walk out across the country ""effectively shutting down the railway network."" More than 560 dockworkers at the Port of Liverpool one of Britain's largest container docks are also among the public workers taking industrial action in this month.

In France media reports say transport and public services workers are set to protest across the country throughout September demanding better pay. Unions such as the CGT are pushing for public services workers go on strike.

European inflation was already high in the aftermath of the Coronavirus pandemic. However prices have increased further after Europe imposed sanctions on Russian energy supplies in the aftermath of the Ukraine conflict. The fighting broke out after Moscow warned against the eastward expansion of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance toward its border.

Critics say America is the biggest beneficiary of the conflict as it makes a generous profit on energy sales while at the same time managed to finally prevent Russian energy from flowing to Europe.

German protesters have gathered in the country’s municipality of Lubmin in the country’s north east at the site of Nord Stream gas pipeline terminal from Russia.

They have called for the opening of Nord Stream 2 a new pipeline which was about to go operational despite Washington’s pressure on Berlin but has been blocked by the German government after the conflict broke out.

At a rally speakers called for a ban on exports of weapons to Ukraine and the resignation of the federal government. On the energy crisis the protesters demanded the Nord Stream 2 pipeline be put into operation immediately and that no LNG terminals be built offshore.

Footage shows the participants waving German and Russian flags. Slogans such ""Nord Stream 2 instead of fracking gas"" and ""Your sanctions hit us"" were seen on banners.

Meanwhile tens of thousands of Czechs protested in Prague against the European Union and the NATO military alliance. They demanded help with rising energy bills the largest manifestation of public discontent over inflation.

About 70000 people filled Wenceslas Square in the center of the Czech capital according to police estimates holding signs denouncing the country’s membership of the EU and the NATO military alliance while demanding military neutrality over the conflict in Ukraine.

Czech inflation is currently the highest since 1993 and the central bank forecasts it to peak at around 20 percent in the coming months. Organizers have vowed to stage further rallies unless the government steps down.

Last week the county’s justice minister Pavel Blažek who is also a member of the prime minister’s party warned of the risk of riots and the fall of the government in the absence of an urgent solution to the winter energy crisis. “If the energy crisis is not resolved the political system of this country is at risk” he said.

Demonstrations elsewhere in Europe saw around 8000 people march in Budapest in solidarity with Hungary’s teachers who say they are facing low pay and poor working conditions. Teachers in neighboring Poland say they face a similar problem.

The ferocious rise in the cost of living crisis has shaken people in Spain where the conservative opposition has surged to a poll lead of almost nine points ahead of next year’s general election.

Inflation is high on the list of worries among Swedes voting in the general election on September 11. Parties are rushing with promises to ease the pain but take a risk with short term measures that may have long term costs on the country’s economy.

Other places the inflation impact is being felt in politics include the UK where a new poll shows only 12 percent of Britons expect new PM Truss to be a great or good prime minister with half (52 percent) expecting her to be poor or terrible.

And the crisis may linger on; last week the chief executive of Shell predicted that Europe is headed for a multi-winter energy crisis. ""It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions"" Ben van Beurden told a news conference.

That is the finding of a survey of 600 global C-suite executives commissioned by Verizon Business. In areas such as transforming customer and employee experience — and on critical issues such as talent acquisition and technology deployment — there is a gap between business growth and the ability to drive meaningful long-term change.

Conducted by Longitude the survey aims to explore how companies have managed the impact of the pandemic as a catalyst for change — and how corporate leaders are reimagining their business for future growth.

The good news is that post-pandemic business leaders feel better equipped to make decisions quickly (71%) think strategically about long-term objectives (72%) adopt new technologies (75%) and develop more empathetic and trusting relationships with both customers (71%) and employees (69%).

But despite these positive sentiments faced with continous upheaval and the growing complexity of the hybrid business environment many companies are now facing a sense of strategic uncertainty. Two-thirds of business leaders (66%) said the pandemic had exposed weaknesses in strategy while 60% said that they struggle to act decisively in response to new market opportunities.

Sampath Sowmyanarayan Chief Executive Officer for Verizon Business Group said “The big lesson we’ve learned over the last few years is that there’s not a single right way to lead build a culture or execute a strategy. This is why we also see many organizations attempting to adopt a ‘bias to yes’ as a guiding principle. They are increasingly giving employees the freedom to challenge the status quo and openly ask questions such as why a deployment may take so long or why can’t their business deliver on their customer needs.”

Growing gap between intent and execution

More than half of executives surveyed highlighted the increasing role played by leadership teams in technology adoption over the past 12 months – with cybersecurity services (78%) data analytics software and tools (75%) and cloud enablement (74%) among the top technology priorities. However the report identifies a disconnect between intent and execution. For example improving customer experience comes out as the top strategic priority (74%). However only a third (38%) say they have accelerated the use of data analytics to improve customer experience with even fewer harnessing automation to better serve customers. In tandem the report also highlights a concerning lack of digital skills (33%) as the most common gap facing businesses.

Accelerating into the future

Businesses face a potent cocktail of challenges from changing consumer behaviors to technology-driven market disruption and the imperative for sustainability the study goes on to recommend how business leaders can steer their organizations into the future:

Navigate a clear path through a deeply uncertain business environment

Understand the importance of building resilience and delivering change through partnerships

Unite the workforce with a clear purpose

Drive innovation through experimentation and fear-free risk-taking

Unlock the potential of the whole workforce through inclusive cultures

For those who were basking in the sun instead BioSpace has the details below.

Labor Day Weekend

Vertex announced The FDA approved expanded use of cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi to include treatment of pediatric patients under 2 years of age. The approval will allow for the treatment of patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Orkambi was previously approved for use in cystic fibrosis patients 2 years and older with two copies of the F508del mutation.

With this approval approximately 300 children with two copies of the F508del mutation will have a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease for the first time the company said in its announcement.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein that is inherited from both parents. Carmen Bozic chief medical officer at Vertex said treating children with cystic fibrosis as early as possible is critically important because it can slow its progression.

MannKind Corporation completed its Phase I program assessing clofazimine inhalation (MNKD-101) suspension as a potential treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease.

Data from the Phase I study of 24 healthy adults showed MNKD-101 was generally well tolerated at daily doses of up to 90 mg over a seven-day period. The trial assessed three different dosing levels of 30 mg 60 mg and 90 mg. There were no lab abnormalities QT prolongation or serious adverse events identified the company said. MannKind is in talks with the FDA regarding the results and future development of MNKD-101.

Additional data collected during the MKC-CI-001 study is currently undergoing final analysis. Detailed data findings will be presented in upcoming publications and scientific conferences.

MNKD-101 has been designated by the FDA as both an orphan lung and a qualified infectious disease product for the treatment of pulmonary NTM infections.

Boehringer Ingelheim released positive data from its Phase III INpedILD study assessing the pharmacokinetics (dosing) and safety profile of Ofev (nintedanib. The drug is being assessed in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 who have clinically significant fibrosing interstitial lung disease.

Investigators said the trial data supports the potential use of Ofev as a treatment for these patients. Results showed the weight-based dosing regimen of Ofev “resulted in comparable exposure” to adults assessed with the medication. Ofev posted an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with no new safety signals observed the company announced.

Data from the study was published in the European Respiratory Journal and will be shared at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in Spain.

Based on these findings Boehringer Ingelheim intends to seek regulatory approval in both Europe and the United States.

September 2

Novartis announced that it is showcasing the latest data from some of the leading immunology products in its pipeline at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology congress and the 15th International Symposium of Sjögren's Syndrome both happening this month.

A total of 37 abstracts will be featured across the two events covering areas such as psoriasis hidradenitis suppurativa chronic spontaneous urticaria and Sjögren's Syndrome. Highlights include late-breaking results from trials for Cosyentyx for HS psoriasis and spondyloarthritis ianalumab for Sjögren's Syndrome remibrutinib for chronic spontaneous urticaria and more.

Immuneering Corporation submitted an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA to support its trial of IMM-1-104 an oral once-daily treatment for advanced RAS mutant solid tumors. The Phase I/IIa clinical trial evaluates a third generation MEK inhibitor that's made for broad pan-RAS as well as other MAPK-activated tumors.

Preclinical data has so far shown that IMM-1-104 has robust anti-tumor capabilities across various in vitro and in vivo tumor models. This is driven by MAPK pathway events including animal models of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer KRAS mutant colorectal cancer KRAS mutant lung cancer and NRAS mutant melanoma. This all while maintaining a good safety profile regardless of the specific mutation upstream of MEK.

The FDA will assess the IND application before the company is allowed to commence a clinical trial. Immuneering is also preparing for the Phase I/IIa trial of IMM-1-104 for advanced solid tumors with RAS mutations with the goal to recruit patients at five globally recognized clinical sites in the U.S.

AnaptysBio failed to meet primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in its study of imsidolimab for hidradenitis suppurativa. Topline data from the HARP P2b trial which enrolled 149 patients in Europe and North America tested the drug for moderate to severe HD. The participants received subcutaneous monthly doses of imsidolimab at either 400 mg/200 mg 200 mg/100 mg or a placebo followed by a 16-week extension period.

While the drug demonstrated safety and tolerability throughout it did not achieve the primary endpoint of a mean change in AN lesion count from baseline by the 16th week. It also did not meet the secondary endpoint based on the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response which regulatory agencies typically use to evaluate potential treatments for HS.

Regenxbio shared additional positive interim results from its Phase I/II/III trial of candidate RGX-121 for patients under five years old with Hunter Syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis Type II MPS II). Data from the CAMPSITE trial demonstrated the drug's ability to meet the primary endpoint of safety with new data showing the largest median reduction in CSF glycosaminoglycans in patients at 48 weeks. RGX-121 also continued to be well-tolerated across all three dose levels evaluated. Details were presented at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) annual symposium.

August 30

Sangamo Therapeutics released preliminary Phase I/II data from its trial of isaralgagene civaparvovec (ST-920) showing that the candidate drug for Fabry disease continued to be well tolerated across three dose cohorts. The five longest treated participants in the study demonstrated elevated α-Gal A activity for up to 15 months as of the February 14 cutoff date prompting the researchers to advance the Phase I/II STAAR trial into the dose expansion phase. The α-Gal A levels ranged from almost threefold to nearly 17-fold above the mean normal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY3lzdGljZmlicm9zaXNuZXdzdG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3Mvb3JrYW1iaS1mZGEtYXBwcm92YWwtY2YtY2hpbGRyZW4tc3RhcnRpbmctMS15ZWFyLW9sZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orkambi to Treat CF in Children Starting at 1 Year Old in US | FDA...,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the expanded use of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) to treat children starting at 12 months old with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) gene — the gene that is defective in CF.

Developed and marketed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Orkambi was first approved by the FDA in 2015 for patients ages 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation. That approval was expanded in 2016 for children ages 6 to 11 and again in 2018 to include 2- to 5-year-olds in this patient group.

“Treating children with cystic fibrosis as early in life as possible is critically important because early treatment has the potential to slow the progression of this devastating disease” Carmen Bozic MD an executive vice president of global medicines development and medical affairs and chief medical officer at Vertex said in a Vertex press release.

“Today’s approval is another important step on our journey to reach people of all ages living with cystic fibrosis who may benefit from our medicines” Bozic added.

CF is caused by mutations in the CTFR gene that lead to a defective or missing CTFR protein. Children with CF inherit two defective CTFR genes one from each parent and the disease can be detected early in life by genetic tests. The majority of patients have at least one F508del mutation although almost 2000 disease-causing mutations have been identified.

CFTR protein cellular processing and trafficking is compromised in patients with two copies of the F508del mutation resulting in little to no CFTR at the cell surface.

Phase 3 trial supports Orkambi’s safety efficacy in very young children

Orkambi is an oral medicine that combines lumacaftor which increases the amount of protein at the cell surface by targeting the trafficking defect and ivacaftor which facilitates the ability of the CTFR protein to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. Orkambi contributes to rehydrate mucus and clear its accumulation from the airways and other organs.

The newest extension was supported by data from a Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03601637) showing that Orkambi can safely treat children as young as 1 year old. Results are detailed in the study “ A Phase 3 Open-Label Study of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor in Children 1 to Less Than 2 Years of Age With Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for F508del-CFTR ” published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

This open-label safety and efficacy study enrolled 46 children ages 1 to just under 2 years with two copies of the F508del mutation at sites in the U.S. and Canada. Children were treated for 24 weeks with Orkambi.

Data showed that Orkambi is safe and generally well-tolerated in these very young children and it is effective in reducing sweat chloride concentration.

An improvement in pancreatic function and an easing of intestinal inflammation as assessed by biochemical markers were also noted. Children’s growth parameters remained normal during the study.

Orkambi’s pharmacokinetics — the process by which it is absorbed distributed and metabolized and expelled by the body — were similar to that reported in patients of other age groups.

Adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity and consistent with CF manifestation. The most common were cough pulmonary CF exacerbation or flare vomiting and fever.

Findings support the use of Orkambi in children as young as 12 months old the study concluded.

“Efficacy results including robust reductions in sweat chloride concentration suggest the potential for CF disease modification with lumacaftor/ivacaftor [Orkambi] treatment. These results support the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in this population” the scientists wrote.

According to Vertex Orkambi is currently available in more than 30 countries. With this label extension in the U.S. around 300 children with two copies of the F508del mutation in the CTFR gene will be eligible for this treatment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2FsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3Mvbm1wYS1jYW5zaW5vYmlvLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China NMPA approves CanSinoBIO's Covid-19 vaccine as booster,"The National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA) has approved CanSino Biologics’ (CanSinoBIO) recombinant Covid-19 vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector) for inhalation Convidecia Air as a booster.

This vaccine leverages the same adenovirus vector technological platform as Convidecia the intramuscular version.

Providing a non-invasive option Convidecia Air utilises a nebuliser to convert liquid into an aerosol for inhaling through the mouth the company noted.

The needle-free vaccine can also elicit complete immune protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus after just a single inhalation.

In March last year CanSinoBIO obtained approval for the clinical trial application to analyse Convidecia Air.

CNBC reported in April last year that the vaccine is being developed by the company in partnership with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (BIB).

According to studies Convidecia Air could prompt robust cellular humoral and mucosal immunity to attain triple protection as well as control the virus spread and the infection.

The company has presently attained steady manufacturing of several innovative vaccines and set up a supply chain worldwide to increase accessibility to quality vaccine products for people globally.

In May CanSinoBIO received an emergency use listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO) for its recombinant Covid-19 shot Convidecia.

Administered as a single dose the genetically engineered vaccine has the replication-defective adenovirus type 5 vector that expresses the spike S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The regional casino operator which began in Europe doesn’t have what gaming observers consider a flagship resort. Its two casinos in the historic Colorado mining communities of Central City and Cripple Creek are repurposed storefront-style buildings with a combined 52 hotel rooms that are primarily set aside for casino players.

“Colorado was effectively Century’s beachhead to begin expanding in the U.S” Stifel Financial gaming analyst Jeffrey Stantial said. “At the time Colorado was the only state that was willing to license a brand-new international entrant.”

Century’s casinos in West Virginia and Missouri are one-to-two-hour drives from metropolitan communities and the locations are not considered major tourist destinations.

The company which went public in 1994 and opened a corporate office in Colorado Springs has historically focused its growth internationally including a collection of gaming operations in Alberta Canada and Poland.

The interest changed in 2019 when Century spent $107 million to acquire the operations of two Missouri properties and the West Virginia racetrack casino.

Northern Nevada provides Century an opportunity to prove its operational expertise in a destination market.

The Nugget has 1382 hotel rooms more than triple the combined hotel rooms Century has in its U.S. portfolio. Gaming analysts believe the Nugget will account for an estimated 20 percent of Century’s total annual cash flow once the sale closes in early 2023.

“We have never operated a casino which has so much non-gaming revenue” said Century Executive Vice President Andreas Terler who oversees the company’s U.S operations. “The property has a wonderful team and the Northern Nevada market has a lot of potential.”

Terler who lives in Vienna Austria but is a frequent traveler to the U.S. said Nevada was a target for Century since the company moved into Colorado.

“If you’re a gaming company wouldn’t you want to be in Nevada?” he said. “It’s basically been a dream for us and we’ve been looking for the right opportunity.”

The Nugget was developed by Northern Nevada gaming pioneer John Ascuaga who died in June 2021 at age 96. Las Vegas-based Marnell Gaming acquired the property in 2016 for an undisclosed price.

“I have a lot of respect for John Ascuaga” Terler said. “We are not very different from private owners. We love the properties and we spend time trying to improve them. Anthony and his team have done a great job with the property.”

He said Century has historically kept a property’s management team on board following an acquisition and the same approach is planned for the Nugget.

In the deal with Marnell Gaming Century is paying $100 million for the operations of the Nugget and $95 million for 50 percent ownership of the real estate. Century has a five-year option to purchase the remaining 50 percent of the site located just off of Interstate 80 and roughly three miles from Reno-Tahoe International Airport.

Expanding in the U.S.

Transitioning to a casino company focused on U.S. operations took longer than expected.

Stantial said larger regional casino operators including Penn National Boyd Gaming and Eldorado Resorts dominated the consolidation market during the 2000s and 2010s.

Larger operators are now focused on paying down debt on their balance sheets and launching digital-focused gaming activities such as sports betting and online casinos.

“It’s opened up an opportunity for Century to grow in the U.S. as evidenced by the Nugget deal” Stantial said.

JMP Securities gaming analyst Jordan Bender said Century’s 2019 deal to buy the operations of the Mountaineer Casino and Racetrack in West Virginia and two Missouri riverboat casinos in Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville as part of a $385 million overall transaction with the then-Eldorado Resorts was the turning point in the company’s direction.

The deal happened because Eldorado needed to unwind a potential antitrust issue in Missouri that could have affected the company’s $17.3 billion merger with Caesars Entertainment.

Real estate investment trust VICI Properties acquired the land and buildings for the three locations from Eldorado and leased the casinos back to Century to operate.

Century and VICI teamed up again on Aug. 25 to acquire the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Maryland from Las Vegas-based Golden Entertainment for a combined $260 million. Century is kicking in $56.1 million for the operations while VICI will pay $203.9 million for the land and buildings. Century will pay VICI $15.5 million annually through a lease agreement to manage Rocky Gap increasing its total annual rent payments to the REIT to $41 million.

“VICI has been a very good partner for us” Terler said prior to the Maryland casino transaction.

Terler said Mountaineer which has nearly 1500 slot machines is the Century’s top gaming revenue producer. Cape Girardeau which is located 120 miles south of St. Louis provides Century with its single-largest annual cash flow total. The Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville properties are undergoing expansions that have been slowed due to supply chain disruptions.

“(The Missouri and West Virginia casinos) were very successful acquisitions and the company wanted to keep growing [its] footprint in the U.S.” Bender said.

Terler suggested the Nugget will be the company’s new flagship hotel-casino.

“We’ve learned much in Colorado. We learned about operating in all our markets” he said. “We have certain types of customers who appreciate smaller casinos. Sparks is a market that has tremendous potential.”

Under Marnell Gaming the Nugget received upgrades to its management systems hotel room renovations and construction of an 8500-seat outdoor events center adjacent to the resort.

Bender said Marnell invested $90 million into the upgrades and the property is in good shape.

“There really will not be much investment needed from Century once they take full ownership” Bender said. “Reno is more non-gaming focused and pulls a lot of destination customers from California for concerts events and conventions.”

When the transaction was announced Century cited Northern Nevada’s economic resurgence that saw several technology and manufacturing companies including Google Tesla Switch Amazon and Apple move into the area.

Bender said Reno’s population growth of 15 percent between 2010 and 2020 exceeded the national average of 7.4 percent and an increase in technology and manufacturing jobs has led to wage growth and home prices outpacing the U.S. average.

“That’s a positive tailwind for the market and the wallet size at the casino” Bender said. “Additionally wage growth for Reno feeder markets have all outpaced the U.S. average in the last five years and bodes well for spend at the casino as the market fully recovers.”

Terler said Century is still looking for other Nevada opportunities although Las Vegas is not on the company’s radar even with Caesars looking to sell one of its Strip resorts.

“We’re conservative and cautious. We want to demonstrate that we can deliver” Terler said. “Las Vegas is a different category. Let’s say that's a long-term goal.”

When the Nugget and Rocky Gap deals close next year Century will operate 11 casinos that have 7140 slot machines and 158 table games.

B Riley Securities gaming analyst David Bain noted the pending transactions will transform the Century into “a nearly North American pure-play” business with 94 percent of all cash flow coming from its U.S. and Canadian casinos. In 2019 that figure was 78 percent.

Century has attempted to sell its casinos in Poland but the country borders Ukraine and the conflict with Russia has slowed that process.

Still a Colorado company

Century opened its first Century-branded Colorado casino in 2006 in Central City located 45 minutes west of Denver. The company was involved with another casino operator in Cripple Creek located an hour west of Colorado Springs before expanding to an adjacent casino and adding the Century name to the property.

“As it sits today Colorado is about 10 percent of the company’s earnings” Bender said.

Terler said Century is satisfied with its operation in both markets. The small Central City casino has faced competition from large expansion projects in nearby Black Hawk including a 536-room hotel tower at Ameristar Black Hawk which opened in 2009 and a $442 million expansion at Monarch Black Hawk which included a 516-room hotel tower.

“We have a good base of repeating customers in Black Hawk but these casinos are probably small for us now” he said.

In Cripple Creek Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts is spending $180 million to build the 300-room Chamonix Casino Hotel adjacent to its Bronco Billy’s Casino. The development is across East Bennet Avenue from Century Cripple Creek.

“You know how Cripple Creek works? People never go to just one casino” Terler said. “They love to go across the street. Guess who is across the street?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Market Trends Drivers Restraints Competitive Analysis Player Profiling Regulation Analysis

The increasing digitalization in diverse sectors as well as technological breakthroughs will serve as growth drivers for the P2P payment market. P2P payment benefits such as efficiency simplicity reliability and convenience of use will provide significant growth potential for the peer-to peer (P2P) payment market size. P2P payments allow users to transfer money instantly while maintaining their bank account information secret. Moreover funds are sent with the touch of a button. As a result of these factors the demand for P2P payment is likely to increase.

Besides that the currently underway Covid-19 outbreak has made the in-person financial sector much more difficult resulting in a large number of hesitant first-time customers of digital banking. The expansion is seen in all sectors of financial services from e-commerce to capital management although peer-to-peer (P2P) payment solutions have witnessed particularly high development building on a trend that began prior to the epidemic. Furthermore the increased usage has resulted in a windfall for the leading fintech companies and distributors of P2P services. Venmo and SquareSQ two of the most active participants were started over a decade ago.

Global P2P Payment Market Dynamics

P2P payments also known as peer-to-peer payments are digital payment transfers from one participant to another via an intermediary. Furthermore all P2P transactions are carried out digitally eliminating the requirement for a middleman resulting in exceptionally cheap transaction costs averaging from 2-3% giving an enhanced user experience as well as transparency. Also since P2P payments are secured and feature fraud security measures it represents one of the most cost-effective and secure payment options. Besides that many apps and online solutions use biometrics and digital alerts for every transaction to safeguard the money and ensure transparency.

Rapid digitalization increased consumer acceptance of electronic or digital banking solutions online wallets and e-commerce and increased smartphone penetration among the younger crowd all contribute to the expansion of the worldwide P2P payment market share. Furthermore a rise in the m-commerce business across emerging economies has a beneficial impact on market growth. However problems such as a rise in information breaches or security concerns with P2P payments are projected to stymie market expansion. On the other a boost in the desire for convenient and simple payment solutions as well as increased use of RFID NFC and host card emulation technologies in P2P payments is likely to provide the lucrative potential for the P2P payment market trend throughout the projection period.

(KCTV) - A 254-unit apartment complex is one step closer to coming to Kansas City’s Berkley Riverfront.

The City Plan Commission approved the project 5-0 Tuesday morning with conditions.

The building is set for construction at E. Riverfront Drive on Berkley Parkway right next to Bar K and east of the Heart of America Bridge.

A St. Louis-based development company named ‘Lux Living’ is pitching the seven-story residential building. It will feature a parking garage with 230 parking stalls underneath the building. The main entrance will be on the south side of the building.

A report from the City Plan Commission says staff would like to see pedestrian access on the northern side of the building as well.

This comes as a streetcar extension is set to be completed by 2025 connecting 3rd and Grand directly to the Riverfront. The city is also working on a bike and pedestrian bridge that will connect the River Market area to the Berkley Riverfront Park area. The final design on that is expected to be completed in nine months.

Tuesday’s approval means the commission will make a recommendation to the City Council and the council’s Neighborhood Planning and Development Committee. That committee will then make a recommendation to the council on whether to approve the project.

In 2019 Maureen McNamara and her wife Jennifer Stark now both 60 took a leap of faith and decided to sell their popular restaurant Amici’s Kitchen & Living Room in the Detroit suburb of Berkley Mich. The couple had owned it for 15 years. They packed up all their belongings — including two Shih Tzus named Junie and George — and moved to the tiny hamlet of Phoenicia N.Y. nestled in the Catskill Mountains about 100 miles north of New York City.

“We had lost our passion and had become extremely burned out” Ms. McNamara said. “We bought the restaurant from Jen’s brother so it never felt like ours. We wanted something that was.”

That something was the Phoenicia Lodge a collection of rustic 1940s cabins with wooden planks made up of five rooms two suites and six independent cottages that the couple bought in the beginning of 2020. (Rates start at $135 a night.)"

According to a Tuesday (Sept. 6) news release Boots Marketplace is scheduled to launch in the spring of 2023. The offering will allow brands to list their products on the company website giving them access to millions of visitors each month.

“The new offering is part of Boots’ ongoing digital strategy to rapidly extend the range of the UK’s most visited health and beauty website and explore new and diverse categories for its customers” the company said.

Boots also noted its marketplace products will be integrated with the existing product range on its website giving customers access to hundreds of new brands from both established names and newer sellers.

The marketplace is powered by the Software-as-a-Service platform Mirakl and customers can still access shop-specific benefits like Boots Advantage Card points. Brands meanwhile can benefit from Boots’ reputation and the possibility of future store listings the company said.

“Since 2020 Boots has launched around 70 new and cult beauty brands including Elemis which landed in 10 stores and on boots.com last week as well as smaller up-and-coming brands” Boots said in the release. “Marketplace will give customers access to even more brands and products and give suppliers of all sizes an opportunity to reach Boots customers.”

Boots was nearly put up for sale earlier this year — along with No7 cosmetics — in a deal that was reportedly worth as much as $7.5 billion before Walgreens decided to retain ownership.

In June Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Rosalind Brewer said it was in the best interests of shareholders to focus on furthering growth and profitability at the businesses which she said had shown strong growth in the face of challenging economic conditions.

“Since launching the process the global financial markets have suffered unexpected and dramatic change” the company said at the time. “As a result of market instability severely impacting financing availability no third party has been able to make an offer that adequately reflects the high potential value of Boots and No7 Beauty Company.”

NEW YORK -- Gustavo Arnal the chief financial officer of Bed Bath & Beyond jumped to his death from a high-rise apartment in Manhattan on Friday afternoon a law enforcement source previously told CNN.

The NYPD said in a statement Sunday that Arnal 52 was found unconscious and unresponsive outside his luxury 57-story skyscraper in the neighborhood of Tribeca.

The law enforcement source told CNN on Sunday that Arnal's wife witnessed him jump. The source said while no suicide note was found no criminality is suspected.

Bed Bath & Beyond is ""profoundly saddened by this shocking loss"" a company spokesperson said.

In a statement Sunday the Independent Chair of Bed Bath & Beyond's Board of Directors Harriet Edelman said ""I wish to extend our sincerest condolences to Gustavo's family.""

""Our focus is on supporting his family and his team and our thoughts are with them during this sad and difficult time. Please join us in respecting the family's privacy"" Edelman said.

Arnal joined Bed Bath & Beyond in May 2020 following a career in finance at Avon Walgreens Boots Alliance and Procter & Gamble.

Arnal was named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit accusing him Ryan Cohen and other large shareholders of engaging in a ""pump and dump"" scheme to artificially inflate the price of the company's stock. The lawsuit was filed last month in United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The lawsuit claims that Arnal and others made misleading statements and omissions when communicating to investors regarding the company's strategic plans and financial condition and delayed disclosures about holding and selling their own shares. The suit also alleges the stakeholders shared fake revenue numbers and company plans for spinning off its ""Buy Buy Baby"" brand to fuel a stock buying frenzy.

Bed Bath & Beyond is in deep financial turmoil. The company is trying to rescue itself and stay out of bankruptcy by shrinking. The chain said last week that it will lay off approximately 20% of corporate employees close around 150 stores and slash several of its in-house home goods brands. The company also said it secured more than $500 million in financing to shore up its ailing financial straits.

Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond were 15% lower in premarket trading following Arnal's death.

We are proud of our pharmacists who help patients understand the risks about opioid prescriptions. And our pharmacists have refused to fill hundreds of thousands of opioid prescriptions they thought could be problematic.

On top of that Walmart has blocked thousands of questionable doctors from having their opioid prescriptions filled by any of our pharmacists as part of our good-faith efforts to help address the opioid crisis.

As a result many health regulators medical groups doctors and patients say that Walmart is going too far in refusing to fill opioid prescriptions—and even say we are improperly interfering in the doctor-patient relationship and potentially harming patients who need their medicine.

This is a big reason why plaintiff-lawyer driven lawsuits brought around the country against Walmart and other pharmacies are misguided and dangerous to public health. In search of deep pockets plaintiffs’ lawyers representing cities counties and others are pushing a legal theory that pharmacies should be held responsible for the opioid crisis. In fact courts around the country have rejected plaintiffs’ novel “public nuisance” liability theories in lawsuits in Arkansas Connecticut Delaware Illinois California Oklahoma North Dakota and South Dakota. As the Wall Street Journal said it makes no sense to punish pharmacies for “filling legal prescriptions for a legal substance for real patients from licensed doctors.”

One serious and big-picture problem with the plaintiffs’ attempt to turn pharmacists and pharmacies into the “doctor police” is that it forces them to come between doctors and their patients in a way Congress never intended and federal and state health regulators say isn’t allowed. And many patients say that pharmacies are preventing them from getting needed medicine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbnRvbnJlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOS8wNi93YWxtYXJ0LXJlbW9kZWwtbm9ydGhlYXN0LW9oaW8tYWxsaWFuY2UtY2FudG9uLTIwMjIvNjU0NzQ2NDcwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart to remodel 14 Northeast Ohio stores; two in Stark County,"The Repository

(WFIE) - A Walmart employee is accused of stealing thousands while on the job.

The investigation started back in May when officials say Walmart Asset Protection came to the Evansville Police Department to report the theft.

The asset protection employee told authorities that another employee Kyesha Moredock had possibly taken about $225000.

Officials say Walmart officials provided a video of Moredock

According to police records store officials confronted her in an interview later that month.

They say she denied the allegation and blamed the loss on a software glitch.

EPD says an officer spoke with her after.

Authorities say she told them she worked at Walmart for two years.

She told officers part of her job was to take money to and from the self-checkout registers.

An officer says he confronted her about surveillance video he saw of her breaking the store’s cash control procedures.

The affidavit states that Moredock admitted to violating Walmart’s cash control policy but wouldn’t admit to stealing the money.

Officials say she eventually requested an attorney and officers stopped the interview.

Authorities told Walmart Asset Protection to gather video evidence of Moredock allegedly stealing.

A few days later officers returned to the Walmart store to speak with asset protection.

Walmart officials say they had video evidence of Moredock taking money to her car from April through May which totaled $46000.

Authorities say asset protection only had video of Moredock stealing the $46000 but believe the total amount was actually over $225000.

Moredock was arrested on several theft charges.

About 8:30 p.m. Sunday police received reports about the shooting in the east-side Walmart east of Park East Boulevard. Officers arrived to find Lewis 33 dead in the aisle north of the Home & Pharmacy entrance on the westside of the store. Police said Lewis was targeted by her killer.

Pam Lyman just got into her car in the parking lot and was getting ready to leave with her granddaughter and niece to go to a movie when the shooting happened nearby.

“I heard boom boom and she screamed” Lyman said adding she knew Lewis who was mother to her nephew's child.

Lyman didn't see the shooting and didn't know it was Lewis until she sent to the scene to give first aid.

“I go over there and I helped"" Lyman said as she described being one of three people trying to give the victim CPR and artificial breathing.

“I said a prayer for her"" Lyman said. ""She turned over and she looked at me opened up her eye — I thought we had her — and she smiled and she died. She started turning blue.”

It appeared the victim was shot in the stomach area Lyman said.

Lyman didn't see the man who shot Lewis either.

Immediately after the shooting the man who killed Lewis ran east through the parking lot and into the neighborhood around Fairington Avenue police said citing witnesses' statements.

Police described the suspect as an Hispanic man wearing a red shirt dark shorts a gray hoodie sweatshirt.

Police searched the neighborhood around Fairington Avenue Vineyard Street and Kettle Circle using police dogs at times to try and track the suspect. By 11 p.m. police called off the search.

Tippecanoe County Coroner Carrie Costello who released Lewis' name Monday morning said the autopsy will be Tuesday.

At the scene police set up a gazebo canopy and moved it over the body to shield it from the view of the people milling about the parking lot.

Watching from her van nearby Bennetta Snyder said she knew Lewis who was the mother to one of her grandchildren.

“She was a good woman. I was trying to help her” Snyder said indicating that the woman struggled.

“She didn’t deserve this"" Snyder said. ""She was trying to get her life together.”

This is Tippecanoe County's third homicide in two shooting incidents in 2022.

It's no surprise since you'll need fuel in the morning for visiting the parks and walking around all day. Here are my favorite spots for breakfast inside the parks and some great options in various Walt Disney Resorts as well. As a Central Florida local and an annual Disney World passholder I have been to Walt Disney World countless times and would never steer you wrong.

Main Street Bakery

Julie Tran Deily

In each of the Walt Disney World Parks there is a Starbucks-themed coffee shop and bakery. The Main Street Bakery is located on you guessed it Main Street. It’s convenient because you can grab breakfast as you enter the Magic Kingdom. Yes the breakfast sandwiches here are what you can get at most Starbucks but this one has a special cinnamon roll that is definitely worth trying. It’s Mickey-shaped and is flaky like a croissant. Also look out for holiday cinnamon rolls; at Halloween for example they frost them with orange icing and for Christmas it’s red and green icing.

Magic Kingdom Main Street USA

Gaston’s Tavern

Julie Tran Deily

Everyone talks about the cinnamon rolls at Gaston’s. This is definitely a large shareable cinnamon roll. I couldn’t finish it by myself. You can even request an extra cup of frosting on the side. When you walk into Gaston’s you are immediately hit with the smell of sugar and frosting and it’s intoxicating. I think this cinnamon roll is well done but I will say that the Main Street Bakery Mickey cinnamon rolls are a tad better.

Magic Kingdom Fantasyland

Cinderella’s Royal Table

Disney

Dining inside Cinderella’s castle is such a special treat! Once inside you’re greeted by Cinderella herself and you can snap a photo with her too. Walking up the winding staircase and being seated inside the castle feels so regal. Everyone called us m'lady and our server even addressed us as the royal family.

Breakfast is a set price at $42 for adults and $27 for children. The baked quiche is made with a puff pastry and it’s total buttery perfection. The shrimp and grits were perfectly cooked and the fried egg on top was crucial. If you’re looking for something sweet the caramel apple-stuffed French toast was more of a bread pudding-style breakfast. When you leave Cinderella’s Royal Table a cast member gives you a wand as a souvenir.

Magic Kingdom Fantasyland



Sleepy Hollow

Disney

Sleepy Hollow is in my top-three favorite quick-service restaurants in the Magic Kingdom. Mickey-shaped waffles with strawberries for $7.49 to plain Mickey waffles for $6.49 and their Fresh Fruit Waffle Sandwich at $8.49. If you have never had a Mickey-shaped waffle you should add them to your list. They are the perfect crispiness on the outside and soft on the inside. The waffle sandwich is perfect because no fork and knife are needed. Then come back later for the Sweet-and-Spicy Chicken-Waffle Sandwich.

La Crêperie de Paris

Julie Tran Deily

La Crêperie opened in 2021 around the same time as the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride. Both are crowd favorites and because La Crêperie is so popular it can be hard to get a reservation. Just know that you can also order crepes at the walk-up window outside. I like the ham egg and swiss Galette ($16.95) but I lean more toward sweet crepes over savory. The pomme crepes are served with caramelized salted caramel sauce ($9.95). That salted caramel sauce made it for me and I almost didn’t want to share it with my husband! For $2.95 each you can add whipped cream ice cream or any sauce. It’s totally worth it!

Epcot World Showcase France Pavilion

Connections Eatery

Julie Tran Deily

I told you that you need to try Mickey waffles at Walt Disney World. Well when you go to Epcot you must try the Liege Waffle at Connections Eatery. Made with a brioche dough and piled with pearled sugar before it goes into the waffle iron it has a nice chewy texture. By the way you can watch the Disney chefs making these waffles in the kitchen through a huge glass window. The waffle is covered in strawberries and whipped cream and then topped with chocolate sauce.

Epcot World Celebration

Les Halles Boulangerie-Patisserie

Julie Tran Deily

Can you tell by now that I love the France pavilion in Epcot? The breakfast options and desserts at Les Halles are quite marvelous. The beignet is filled with a chocolate-hazelnut spread and it's the lightest fluffiest doughnut I've ever had. And pro tip: I often order a plain croissant that’s $2.95 for myself and a chocolate croissant that’s $3.80 for my husband to have for breakfast the next day when we are staying on Disney property.

Epcot World Showcase France Pavilion

Hollywood and Vine

Disney

For a while Hollywood and Vine was featuring family-style dining but the buffet is back. Of course you have to get the Mickey waffles and the signature Disney crispy bacon. I have asked cast members how they get their bacon so crispy and they just respond with “It’s Disney magic!” Adults are $42 and children are $27. This is a character breakfast experience as well and Mickey Minnie and friends are usually dressed for a holiday or the season.

Disney's Hollywood Studios Echo Lake

Ronto Roasters

Disney

You can try the overnight oats for $6.99 and the Ronto morning wrap for $12.49. You can also get the Ronto Wrap for $12.99 for breakfast. I highly recommend both wraps but since the morning wrap is only available for breakfast get that and then come back for the Ronto wrap for lunch. The grilled pork sausage is great with eggs and cheese all wrapped in pita bread. There’s also a breakfast plant-based wrap for $11.49 with plant-based eggs and chickpea-onion slaw. The vibe of Ronto Roasters is great too: you feel like you're in Batuu.

Disney's Hollywood Studios Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge

Tusker House Restaurant

Disney

Tusker House is normally a buffet-style restaurant brimming with seemingly endless options. It’s one of my favorite buffets on Disney property. Until November 1 breakfast will be served family style and then the buffet will return. When it returns be sure to get the Simba-shaped waffles the crispy bacon the sweet pastries and the African-inspired breakfast items.

Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park Africa

Capt. Cook's

Disney

You should get the tonga toast at Capt. Cooks or at the Kona Cafe. Both located inside Disney's Polynesian Village Resort. Tonga toast is two gigantic pieces of sourdough bread stuffed with banana deep fried and dusted with cinnamon sugar. You need this trust me. You can also choose between bacon or sausage and I always go with the crispy bacon.

Topolino's Terrace – Flavors of the Riviera

Julie Tran Deily

Am I allowed to pick an absolute favorite? Topolino’s would be tied for 1st place with Cinderella’s Royal Table. But if you had to ask me which one has the better food it’s Topolino’s hands down.

First the wood-fired butcher’s steak was perfectly cooked and the sour cream waffles had just the right amount of sweetness. We also had the avocado toast and the prosciutto and poached egg on top made it. It’s $42 for adults and $27 for children. The server said we could pick one entree and an additional one that would come as a smaller portion. There was plenty of food and with the characters Mickey Minnie Donald and Daisy dressed like they were in a European adventure it was a blast. P.S. Don’t skip the pastries they bring to the table when you first sit down; the croissant and apple crumble muffins are a must.

Disney's Riviera Resort at Epcot Resort Area

Ale & Compass Restaurant

Julie Tran Deily

Ale & Compass is located inside one of my favorite Disney Resorts the Yacht Club. They have a breakfast buffet for $23 but I opted to order breakfast off the menu. The salted caramel apple French toast comes with sausage or bacon for $16 and it's the best French toast I'd had in a while. The service was nice and relaxed.

Disney's Yacht Club Resort at Epcot Resort Area

Boma - Flavors of Africa

Julie Tran Deily

Boma is another crowd favorite for breakfast lunch and dinner. The breakfast buffet is $29 per adult and $17 per child and it's honestly a steal for what you get. The breakfast pastries are fantastic the crispy bacon and so many other options. From the carved ham to the turkey bobotie even the coconut steel-cut oatmeal is so good. And one thing I don’t even like sticky buns and I still went back for a second one. They usually have a different bread pudding with vanilla sauce that you have to try too. Boma is one place I will be going back to again and again.

Sept. 9 through 11 2022 at the Anaheim Convention Center

The aircraft's exterior will be on view at the convention center's Arena; merchandise inspired by ""The Mouse"" will be for sale at the fan convention

Walt Disney famously loved all sorts of innovative modes of transportation from monorails to submarines and planes were most definitely a special source of fascination for the entertainment legend.

We only need to look to ""Plane Crazy"" from 1929 the first-ever Mickey Mouse film to understand the icon's lifelong interest in fantastical flying machines.

And while skyborne wonders can be found throughout the Disney theme parks from Soarin' in Disney California Adventure to Dumbo the Flying Elephant at Disneyland park there will be one place some lucky fans can view the icon's personal Grumman Gulfstream I.

The celebrated plane which ferried Walt Disney from Burbank to New York multiple times during the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair will go on view at D23 Expo the sold-out Disney fan convention taking place at the Anaheim Convention Center from Sept. 9 through 11 2022.

Make that the plane's exterior rather which boasts a fresh coat of paint and other refurbishments a project sponsored by D23 and the Walt Disney Archives. D23 Expo Platinum sponsor Amazon is also a sponsor of the plane's restoration.

Walt Disney Company

Long on view at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando (which later transformed into Disney Hollywood Studios) the plane hasn't been to the West Coast for nearly three decades making its 2022 Southern California return especially sweet.

But the plane's much-anticipated Anaheim appearance won't be solely focused on the outside of the aircraft; visitors will get to see ""never-before-exhibited items from the aircraft's interior"" including an instrument panel displayed near where Walt Disney sat giving him a chance to keep an eye on flight conditions.

There's plenty of Walt Disney Company lore surrounding the plane. It was used for various promotional tours including one celebrating 1967's animated hit ""The Jungle Book"" and it can be seen in ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" from 1969 an enduring live-action favorite starring Kurt Russell.

Goodwill tours became a staple of the plane's flight log too; several stops at children's hospitals all to bring kids some of that Mickey Mouse magic are also a part of its long and storied history.

And speaking of Mickey Mouse? The Grumman Gulfstream I received a new and notable tail number in 1967: N234MM with the ""MM"" standing for the character that started it all.

Merchandise related to the plane which has been delightfully dubbed ""The Mouse"" at the convention. Again D23 Expo is now sold out but even if you don't have a ticket you can keep an eye on the event's social feeds for photos of Walt Disney's fabulous personal flying machine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXBzYXZ2eS5jb20vZGlzbmV5LWZhc3RwYXNzLXJlcGxhY2VkLXdpdGgtZGlzbmV5LWdlbmllLTUxOTg1MDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Has Replaced Its FastPass With Disney Genie,"When the theme parks at the Disneyland Resort in California and Walt Disney World in Florida reopened after having closed for the pandemic they did not offer the line-skipping programs FastPass+ (at Disney World) or Fastpass and MaxPass (at Disneyland). Temporarily halting the programs was one of many changes the parks made amid the pandemic.

Started in 1999 the complimentary Fastpass program and its successors allowed guests to make reservations for rides attractions shows and character greetings. For the rides and attractions it enabled guests to bypass the standby lines and enter special queues that whisked them to the heads of the lines.

As of Dec. 8 Disney has permanently replaced all of its line-skipping programs with Disney Genie a digital park planning service that includes paid options to bypass lines. Here's what you need to know.

What Is Disney Genie+?

Disney Genie+ one of the new line skipping options resembles Disneyland’s MaxPass program. As with MaxPass Disney Genie+ costs $20 per day per person at Disneyland. It costs $15 per day per person at Disney World.

The service which can be accessed through Disney World’s My Disney Experience and Disneyland’s apps allows users to choose the next available times at participating attractions and experiences on the days of their visits. When it is time to return guests can use special Lightning Lane entries to skip the standby lines.

With Disney Genie+ guests are able to listen to audio vignettes about the attractions presumably while they are waiting to board rides. The snippets include expert commentary from Imagineers. At Disneyland the extra-charge service includes unlimited Disney PhotoPass downloads as well. Disney World instead tosses in augmented reality PhotoPass “lenses” that allow visitors to take enhanced photos with their digital devices.

Disney Parks

Disney World visitors are no longer able to make reservations up to 60 days in advance as they could with FastPass+. Instead the service allows them to make their first reservation at 7 a.m. on the day of their visit. Nor are they able to make more than one reservation at a time as they could with FastPass+. At Disneyland guests are able to make their initial Disney Genie+ reservation when they enter one of the parks. According to Disney popular attractions such as Haunted Mansion Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad are included with Disney Genie+.



Can I Purchase Access to Individual Attractions?

In addition to Disney Genie+ Disney is giving visitors the option to purchase Individual Lightning Lane reservations at up to two especially high-demand attractions per day. Eligible rides include Radiator Springs Racers at Disney California Adventure and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.

The costs vary based on the popularity of the attractions and the time of the year. For example at its introduction prices range from $9 for Epcot's Remy's Ratatouille Adventure to $15 for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Disney's Hollywood Studios. Note that these prices are above the cost to enter the parks.



What Else Does Disney Genie Offer?

Visitors can input their preferred attractions and other favorites and the Disney Genie service will provide complimentary suggested itineraries. The app also lets users know current and forecasted wait times to plan their days at the parks better.

The one-stop service allows guests to place mobile dining orders for quick-service eateries make reservations at table-service restaurants and join Virtual Queues for attractions. Disney says that it also includes a virtual assistant to respond to questions and provide access to live cast members for more personalized assistance.

The prospect of having to pay more money at the Disney parks which are already pricey is not appealing—especially for services that were previously included in the cost of admission. But the line management programs had become somewhat unwieldy at both resorts. The new service could make the park experience more enjoyable.

Among the potential upsides to the Disney Genie service is that it should remove a lot of the pre-planning hassle (especially at Disney World and its advance FastPass+ reservations system) and return some of the spontaneity to park visits. Inexperienced Disney Park-goers might find it less intimidating to plan a visit.

Also by replacing the complimentary Fastpass and FastPass+ programs with the paid Disney Genie+ program a lot fewer visitors will likely opt to participate. Therefore fewer people will be sashaying past the folks in the regular queues and skipping the lines. That should reduce the wait times in the standby lines thereby making them more tolerable. And Disneyland’s new Magic Key annual pass program should reduce the number of visitors crowding the California resort’s two parks which would also reduce demand and lower wait times.

Recently the team headed to Atlanta GA to help Alabama State University and Howard University kick off football season at the Cricket MEAC/SWAC Challenge! The Cricket MEAC/SWAC Challenge is an annual season kickoff event showcasing a team from the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) and the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) the prominent conferences of HBCU athletics and NCAA Division I schools. This game aims to bring the unique heritage legacy pageantry and tradition of HBCUs to a national stage. Similar to the Cricket Celebration Bowl Disney on the Yard was provided national exposure as a corporate partner of this ESPN televised HBCU football game. And of course Drum Major Mickey Mouse tagged along for the exciting and jam-packed weekend.

First up members of the Disney on the Yard team and Disney recruiters hosted career exploration sessions for members of the Alabama State University and Howard University bands. The sessions provided an overview of The Walt Disney Company opportunities available to these students at Disney helpful tips for launching a Disney career and personal testimonies of each employee’s Disney journey.

The career exploration session for Alabama State University opened our activations for the weekend. These students were in for a real treat as they heard from one of their very own alumna and current cast member of “Disney’s The Lion King” on Broadway Bonita Hamilton-Caesar. Bonita shared words of encouragement with the band members stating that her drive and work ethic is a result of her time at Alabama State and that anything is possible for them should they choose to pursue a career with Disney.

Next the Disney on the Yard team hosted a career exploration session with the band of Howard University. During this session students heard from Monique King a North Carolina A&T State University alumni and human resources manager supporting crew experience for the Walt Disney Studios. Monique encouraged students to consider the Walt Disney Studios as there are a variety of types of roles in production that assist with the final product of a feature film such as finance and logistical roles. Additionally students heard from current content intern and recent Morehouse College graduate James Smartt Jr. James shared what his experience as a Disney Intern has been like some projects he has supported and the importance of making connections with leaders around them.

Then came game-day which began with our Yard Show fan zone pre-game experience! As guests headed to the big game they were welcomed with a Disney and HBCU experience with everything from Disney on the Yard bookstore with fun giveaways an awesome DJ to get the party started and a performance from Drum Major Mickey Mouse! And just like any HBCU campus our Yard Show featured a commemorative plot with a Drum Major Mickey statue surrounded by brick to pay homage to the employees making Disney on the Yard engagements and activations possible.

NOW FOR THE BIG GAME! Disney on the Yard brought some magic for fans with t-shirt tosses throughout the game and touches of Disney on the Yard around the stadium. This was also the perfect opportunity to inform fans parents and alumni of the Innovation Challenge offering for students that will begin in September. By halftime fans were ready for a great show and this show was opened by Drum Major Mickey Mouse! This time Mickey brought some new moves to the field in addition to his signature HBCU Drum Major backbend and we were honored to pay recognition to the HBCU drum majors that have helped prepare Mickey for his performance.

It was a weekend and a pleasure for Disney on the Yard to attend the Cricket MEAC/SWAC Challenge and continue to emphasize our support of Historically Black Colleges and Universities!

Discovery and BT Group Close Transaction to Form Sports Joint Venture,"BT Sport and Eurosport UK assets now transferred into the new combined JV

BT Sport and Eurosport UK retain separate brands today; will be brought together under a single brand in the future

LONDON 31 August 2022: Warner Bros. Discovery and BT Group have today completed their transaction to form a 50:50 Joint Venture (JV) that combines the assets of BT Sport and Eurosport UK.

The move brings together one of the most extensive line-ups of live sport coverage for fans in the UK & Ireland – including the Olympic Games the Premier League UEFA Champions League UEFA Europa League the Premier League Premiership Rugby MotoGP UFC Boxing WWE tennis Grand Slams cycling Grand Tours and the winter sports World Cup season.

As work begins to develop the new sports offering for the UK & Ireland BT Sport and Eurosport UK will retain their separate product propositions for a period of time. BT Sport and Eurosport UK customers can continue to enjoy the current sport offerings in all the same ways they do currently.

Over time the intention is to launch a new sports brand in the market and present this combined sports offering together with an entertainment offering from Warner Bros. Discovery.

Marc Allera Chairman of the JV and CEO BT’s Consumer division said: “As we enter our ninth season today is day one of an exciting new chapter for BT Sport. I am extremely proud of the teams and the established brand and broadcaster that BT Sport has become and I look forward to working with Warner Bros. Discovery to create an exciting new sport TV offering for the UK.”

Andrew Georgiou board member of the JV and President and Managing Director Warner Bros. Discovery Sports Europe said: “Today marks the start of our journey to build a new sports destination for fans in the U.K and Ireland. Combining BT Sport and Eurosport U.K. together with Warner Bros. Discovery’s world-class and growing entertainment offering will result in an exciting new proposition for consumers.

“It’s important for fans to know they can continue to enjoy BT Sport and Eurosport U.K. as they do today and we’ll keep them updated on future plans as soon as we can. We are pleased the transaction has closed and we can now further engage all stakeholders in the process of establishing the JV and developing its extensive combined sports offer.”

The JV’s Board of Directors is equally represented between appointees of British Telecommunications plc and Warner Bros. Discovery. The first Chairperson nominated by each shareholder on a rotating basis is Marc Allera CEO BT’s Consumer division. Andrew Georgiou President and Managing Director Warner Bros. Discovery Sports Europe is also a member of the board and will lead the business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXZhbGllcmRhaWx5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDkvd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LWFuZC1vdGhlci1zdHJlYW1pbmctdGl0YW5zLWFyZS1sZWF2aW5nLWNyZWF0aXZlcy1hbmQtYXVkaWVuY2VzLW91dC10by1kcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. Discovery and other streaming titans are leaving creatives and audiences out to dry,"From comedy television shows to horror movies and everything in between corporations like HBO Max Netflix and Hulu are constantly producing content or staking their claim in works that have already been aired.

In the last decade streaming services have become some of the most dominant forces governing audience consumption of entertainment. From comedy television shows to horror movies and everything in between corporations like HBO Max Netflix and Hulu are constantly producing content or staking their claim in works that have already been aired.

But recent news about streaming services has been worrying. Warner Bros. Discovery –– the media conglomerate that owns HBO Max –– lost $3.4 billion dollars in its first-ever quarter as a combined company which ran from April 1 to June 30. Though making profits through production and in its studios Warner Bros. Discovery is currently not making money through streaming.

Of course losses in the entertainment industry are a given. Not every single movie or show is going to win audiences over regardless of celebrity affiliation or crowd-pleasing dialogue. However a titan like Warner Bros. Discovery failing so intensely is shocking to see considering how popular streaming services have become over the years.

It seems that attempts to penny-pinch at every turn are to blame. David Zaslav chief executive officer and president of Warner Bros. Discovery has openly admitted that focusing on “financial opportunities” was a big priority for the company in a memo to his staffers. In a myriad of cost-cutting decisions he has shut-down CNN+ is making moves to implement one streaming platform for the whole company and most recently has okayed the scrapping of content on HBO Max.

Following the merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery+ earlier this year HBO Max shelved 20 originals and 36 titles overall from their library to save dough including 200 episodes of Sesame Street and recent favorites like “Infinity Train” and “Summer Camp Island.”

To the dismay of audiences and creatives alike Warner Bros. Discovery has been unafraid to throw films and shows away without much warning. Now original illustrative media on their platform will be sent to the depths of the internet where they may only be found through pirating many Twitter users say . Creators like Owen Dennis of “Infinity Train” felt left in the dust following the company’s decision and “had no idea [the chop] was coming” he writes in a Substack post.

Student filmmakers and creators are taking notice of how tense the environment is becoming in the cinema sphere fearful of what this could mean for their beloved artform in the future.

One of them is Max Berengaut a fourth-year College student and president of the Virginia Filmmakers/Filmmakers Society.

“In general the film industry sees what they create as numbers in a spreadsheet” Berengaut said. “This somewhat new environment’s worst problem is that there is no longer any incentive to be original or inventive. There is only the incentive to generate income for the company stakeholders.”

Educators in the field have also noticed how profit hungry streaming services have become.

“It is all about the bottom-line and what makes business sense” Matt Marshall University Media Studies professor said. “It is a shell game.”

However Marshall does point out that creators and audiences should not lose faith in where the film industry is going.

“With more platforms there are more opportunities for writers actors and filmmakers” Marshall said. “The downside is there is a lot more content to sift through. There will be a lot of canceled shows but a better chance that an unseen gem can get through.”

Only one of many streaming platforms out there Warner Bros. Discovery may simply be operating as a business would in their situation trying to stay afloat after a major change in organizational structure. But –– as evidenced in their high losses this year –– taking highly-rated content away from viewers and creatives seems to have been the wrong answer.

Although Zaslav’s memo mentions creating a “collaborative culture” that operates as one team his decisions to disregard the hard work that creatives have put in stands as rather contradictory to his desire for cohesiveness. Certainly creators do not feel the level of trust that Zaslav is aiming for as both Berengaut and Dennis pointed out.

Still according to Berengaut the way that Warner Bros. Discovery and other streaming services are conducting their businesses should not have an effect on how art is produced and received by others. Viewers and creators have the real power in film media he believes.

“The only solution I can see is to prove with our own brains that there is still something worthwhile in art left in the world” Berengaut said. “We need to create stuff that’s irrepressible wonderful new genius secular — and most importantly — human.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LW5vcmRpY3MtbWFuYWdlbWVudC10ZWFtLTEyMzUxMDgyMjcv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS93YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3Zlcnktbm9yZGljcy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXRlYW0tMTIzNTEwODIyNy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. Discovery Names Nordic Management Structure; Three More Exiting In Restructure,"Warner Bros. Discovery has set another of its European management teams as Nordic chief Christina Sulebakk lays out the structure of her unit.

The likes of Pil Gundelach Brandstrup Magnus Vatn Axel Eriksson and Katja Santala have landed key country-based content roles in the shake-up while Rebecca Rørmark Sanny Ekstrand and Johan Mannerhill are the highest profile exits. Last month Deadline revealed Nordics originals chief Christian Wikander was among the 29 departing WBD’s European production team as part of a switch to a territory-first model.

WBD’s Nordics operation spans several Discovery-branded linear channels and HBO Max which launched last year but will be replaced with a service that also incorporates Discovery+ in 2024. It also has extensive local production operations.

Of those departing WBD said Rørmark had “decided to explore new opportunities” but will head up marketing of the Discovery channel portfolio trade marketing for HBO Max and publicity “during a period of transition” while SVP of Operations Ekstrand is exiting after four years having spent the past two in an “important role in building the Nordic strategy and operation.” Mannerhill General Manager Nordics for Home Entertainment & Games is leaving after a decade at Warner Bros.’s Nordic arm. WBD is understood to be hiring a replacement for Rørmark.

The full line up is as follows

Pil Gundelach Brandstrup — overseeing content and planning across the Nordics as well as continuing as content lead for Denmark.

Only Pierre Branco’s France Benelux and Africa division is yet to reveal its local structure.

Sulebakk who was named Nordics General Manager in June having previously been General Manager of HBO Max EMEA said: “The Nordics is a highly developed media market and Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the leading media businesses in the region reaching millions of people every day with high-quality content and products.

Grinthal will depart as Warner Bros. Discovery is still making a case to advertisers. The company met with resistance from ad buyers and clients during the industry’s annual “upfront” market when U.S. TV networks try to sell the bulk of their commercial inventory for their next programming cycle.

Warner Bros. Discovery insisted advertisers commit to high levels of volume and outsize rate hikes in order to gain access to top-rated programming according to people familiar with the matter. They also said the company even threatened to withhold ad inventory on HGTV and Warner’s sports portfolio if they refused to comply. Some buyers and ad-sales executives familiar with recent negotiations suggest clients may have moved money elsewhere in a rebuke of the effort. “Despite the more challenging macro environment we’re very pleased with our performance” in the upfront said Gunnar Wiedenfels the company’s chief financial officer during a recent call with investors.

Warner Bros. Discovery is working to rid itself of a sizable debt overhang it inherited when it acquired the former WarnerMedia from AT&T.

During her tenure Grinthal helped weave advertising into Food Network programs that previously avoided integrations. As its famous chefs grew more famous the cable outlet began to work as a broker of sorts that allowed its celebrity food experts to promote sponsors on air. Placements have taken the form of product appearances in the shows themselves or in the ad breaks where Food Network talent might show up in special vignettes hawking the wares.

In 2006 for example Guy Fieri at the time fresh from winning “The Next Food Network Star” began to tout the TGI Friday’s. restaurant chain As Fieri hosted “Ultimate Recipe Showdown” recipes from the program would show up in promotional cards at the chain’s outlets. Alex Guarnaschelli who came to be known as a regular judge on “Chopped” was enlisted to share recipes inspired by sponsor Fisher Nuts during ad breaks on both Food Network and Cooking Channel. And John Lee executive chef of Outback Steakhouse served as a judge on an Australian-themed episode of “Chopped” while FedEx was able to demonstrate how it helped print and deliver posters quickly on “Restaurant: Impossible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1ub3JkaWNzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS10ZWFtLTEyMzUyMTI0MzAv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3Mvd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LW5vcmRpY3MtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXRlYW0tMTIzNTIxMjQzMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros.

Companies are also taking greater responsibility for ensuring their products and practices have minimal impact on the planet. In turn those pressures are being pushed upstream to packaging producers and from them to polymer manufacturers and their raw materials suppliers.

Regulatory pushes for recycling are starting to add pressure too. The European Commission’s single-use plastics directive mandates minimum levels of recycled content for PET bottles for example and the commission is currently revising its Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive which is expected to apply similar mandates for all plastic packaging. Trade association Plastics Europe has suggested 30% would be appropriate and a similar figure has been suggested by the American Chemistry Council in the US.

Developing greener chemicals and materials to enable a shift to more sustainable practices presents numerous challenges. Analytical chemistry plays an important if often unrecognised part in meeting those challenges - from ensuring that new materials are as safe as the materials they are replacing to assessing whether a polymer made from renewable feedstocks performs as well as its established petroleum-derived counterparts. Analytical techniques also have a huge role to play in plastic recycling by giving an insight into how safe reprocessed materials are and how they behave.

‘When you reformulate a plastic with renewables is it still safe?’ says Ben MacCreath strategic programme development manager at Waters Corporation. ‘Changing to renewable sources means a whole new set of unwanted by-products from plastics will need to be captured identified and quantified – that’s a huge task for the analytical lab. People rely on our analytics to work out what’s in there and how much of it there is. What can leach out into the environment? Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) for example can be used to detect problematic compounds that might migrate out of the plastic.’

Scientists need analytical tools that help … to comply with the recycling regulations and mandates that are changing rapidly Ben MacCreath strategic programme development manager Waters Corporation

At the other end of the lifecycle lies plastic waste. It can be incinerated to generate energy but recycling is a better use of those precious resources that also avoids unnecessary carbon emissions. ‘Companies have been making bold declarations about their stance on plastics recycling’ says Michael Onepe marketing development manager at the TA Instruments division of Waters Corporation. While in the future there is the prospect of chemically recycled plastic he says this is still in its infancy and requires heavy energy use. Today mechanical recycling – chopping up the old plastic and reprocessing it – is still the predominate method.

While reusing plastic may seem like a positive practice there are many variables to consider. With virgin resin there will be a small amount of variability from batch to batch but it remains within tight specifications. Plastic offcuts from factory production will also be fairly homogeneous but post-consumer waste can be hugely heterogeneous. As well as the mixture of polymers it will be full of performance-enhancing additives from colourants and pigments to processing aids and fillers all of which can impact how plastic waste behaves in the recycling process. Analytical chemistry is the key to understanding those changes.

‘Suddenly you have unknown chemicals in the waste plastic rather than the tight supply chain control with virgin resin’ MacCreath says. ‘And what about historical waste? It might have been in contact with something unpleasant or could contain now-banned additives. How do you deal with that? There are suddenly far more questions to answer which increases the need for analytical insight.’

When testing resins MacCreath says sampling is already a contentious issue even with virgin material due to the inherent heterogeneity of polymer synthesis formulation and production even under tightly controlled processes. But for a large container of mechanically recycled plastic the challenge looks daunting. ‘While it’s the same analytical process not only do you have to look across a broader chemical space but there are more unknowns and less knowledge of provenance’ he says. ‘From one pellet to the next the composition could be quite different especially from batch-to-batch. Sampling and formulation challenges are coming at a scale and speed unfamiliar to industry scientists need analytical tools that help to overcome these if industry is to comply with the recycling regulations and mandates that are changing rapidly.’

The easiest post-consumer plastic to recycle is Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) water bottles – mechanically recycling the PET and adding it back into the manufacturing process works very well. The inherent properties of PET mean there are few additives to worry about and if the bottle has only ever contained water and the locality has a recycling infrastructure it will also be pretty clean. Conversely the most common class of polymer polyolefins are more difficult. They require more additives to perform their original application and cover a much broader range of applications resulting in more additive residues. The cost and practicalities of solving this means that the recycled material is often downcycled that is used in lower value applications than the original. For instance packaging is a major application space but regulators are still hesitant to permit the use of recycled polyolefins for applications with safety regulations such as food contact materials (FCM).

Onepe adds that there’s a lot of variability within the plastic waste stream even when the polymer itself is ostensibly the same. ‘Polypropylene may contain some polyethylene’ he says. ‘This will affect its mechanical properties and how it flows during processing. How can we design plastics so they can be recycled more easily?’

Analytical techniques that study thermal and rheological properties how they change and how this affects the material’s performance are critical for successful recycling. Techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and rheology can give real insights into this behaviour Onepe says. ‘Now that people are shifting from using virgin plastics to recycled plastics how will this affect the material’s physical properties processing and performance?’ he says. ‘These are the types of answers TA Instruments can help provide.’

We’re looking at the effects of different percentages of regranulate on performance … LC-MS has been essential in identifying markers Pascal Tuszewski project manager thyssenkrup

Recycled plastic has gone through multiple stresses already during the recycling process – both during its initial processing and then in use which can alter its composition. ‘Again our instruments can give you an indication of the performance properties left in [used plastics]’ MacCreath says. ‘For example Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) can tell you about chain lengths as these degrade through various stresses over a plastics lifetime including during the recycling process itself so its performance will not be as good. This can be improved by including some virgin material or more additives but then you have to be careful to check for potential migrant compounds again. It’s a difficult balance.’ It’s one thing if the recycled plastic will be turned into an inexpensive plastic garden table where toxicity and performance are less important but it’s different if the plastic will be used for food contact personal care or critical structural applications.

The German multinational company thyssenkrupp produces steering systems for a variety of car manufacturers and as well as steel these include polyamide components. At its Liechtenstein facility the team is looking to recycle waste polymer offcuts from production as the design of some of the plastic components means the amount of waste can be significant. Pascal Tuszewski project manager says it is essential that the structure of the components remains perfect and some of their automotive customers specify that they cannot be made from recycled material for fear it will impact performance.

Thyssenkrupp started a project with Waters to quantify the impact that recycling has on the material. ‘We’re using techniques such as GPC MS TGA and DSC to characterise the regranulates’ Tuszewski says. ‘Importantly they can also translate this into mechanical performance. We’re also doing DMA mechanical testing for durability as well as static performance measures like using tensile probes.’ Since recycled polymers will typically have shorter chain lengths using GPC to measure the chain lengths and DSC for crystallinity is a key part of understanding how recycling affects the material’s durability. ‘The longer the chain the bigger the crystalline fractions are and the space between them … we can see in our testing rigs that longer polymer chains give better material performance’ says Tuszewski.

It’s not as simple as just looking at the polymer however. There are many other questions to consider: for example additives that were present in the original material might decompose during processing so do other additives need to be incorporated during recycling to restore the performance? These are the sort of questions they are now trying to answer. ‘We’re looking at the effects of different percentages of regranulate on performance’ he says. ‘LC-MS has been essential in identifying markers.’

[Our customers] are looking at the environmental impact of their laboratories Andrew Pastor director of sustainability Waters Corporation

Collaborations like this one between Waters and thyssenkrupp will be key to solving the plastics conundrum Onepe believes. ‘A lot of companies are going through these challenges’ he says. ‘Even though mechanical recycling dominates there are still challenges because the waste has to be clean – it is difficult to work with impurities.’ And the energy requirement for advanced recycling is another part of the sustainability conundrum – recycling plastic reduces waste and materials consumption but it can also reduce a company’s overall sustainability if it means an increased energy demand. ‘Companies want to minimise energy use as part of meeting their sustainability goals’ he adds.

Waters is responding to that goal as well – making analysis more sustainable by designing more energy efficient instruments for example. For Andrew Pastor director of sustainability at Waters Corporation this is an important aspect of the company’s scientific partnership with customers to help them meet their sustainability goals. ‘[Our customers] are looking at the environmental impact of their laboratories including their instruments’ power consumption and the laboratory infrastructure required to run them. And some are looking at the analytical methods and whether they could be modified to make them greener’ he says.

Pastor cites the example of the company’s new Xevo TQ Absolute instrument which sees a step gain in sensitivity for negative ions yet is smaller and quieter than comparable mass spectrometers from competitors and importantly consumes less power and nitrogen. The system also generates less heat which means the demands on air conditioning units will fall too helping in a reduced footprint as well as investment and running costs ‘As our customers go on this journey we’re doing our best to support them’ Pastor says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYm1hbmFnZXIuY29tL3NjaWVudGlzdHMtc3R1ZHktdG91cmlzdHMtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC1ncmVhdC1hcGVzLTI4NzUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scientists Study Tourists to Protect Great Apes,"Register for free to listen to this article

Researchers are protecting great apes from diseases by studying the behavior and expectations of tourists who visit them.

In the new study by an international team including the University of Exeter NOVA University Lisbon and Ugandan NGO Conservation Through Public Health almost 1000 tourists or potential future tourists completed an online questionnaire.

Willingness to comply with disease prevention measures like wearing a face mask varied depending on factors such as nationality expectations about the visitor experience and whether people thought specific disease-risk measures were effective.

The study was conducted in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when the researchers also created the Protect Great Apes from Disease initiative.

""We have developed visitor education and guide-training materials for use in African sites of great ape tourism"" said lead author Dr. Ana Nuno of NOVA University Lisbon and the University of Exeter.

""To do so we first explored what factors seem to affect visitors’ compliance with disease mitigation measures. This included asking them about their actions on previous visits their willingness to comply in future and exploring what factors should be promoted to increase their willingness to follow recommendations. To do so we adapted a tool from the health literature which is commonly used for understanding why individuals may or may not act in the face of a threat to health.""

Dr. Kim Hockings from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation on Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall added: ""Through this greater understanding of the visitors to wild African great ape tourism sites we were able to identify ways of improving measures to reduce disease transmission. This is important not only for COVID-19 but other infectious diseases too particularly at the early stages of future pandemics when information is generally limited but preventive action is required. In the face of growing threats from future pandemics we must minimize disease transmission while ensuring that tourism and research promote long-term support for the conservation of great apes and their habitats as well as maximizing benefits for local communities.""

The questionnaire was completed by 420 past visitors and 569 potential future visitors (from 58 countries in total) to wild great ape tourism sites in Africa.

When compared to other disease-mitigation measures visitors expressed less willingness to being vaccinated against COVID-19 (which at the time the survey was conducted had only just started being administered to very high-risk groups) wearing a facemask during trekking (although willing when viewing the apes) and quarantine after international travel before visiting great apes.

Believing that each specific measure was effective in preventing disease was key to respondents’ willingness to follow that specific recommendation.

The research team included the Helmholtz Institute for One Health (Germany) and the University of the West of England (UK).

Paul Levesque known as “Triple H” during his days in the ring was upped to chief content officer and Frank A. Riddick III is now president and chief financial officer.

Levesque is married to Stephanie McMahon who took over as the company’s Co-CEO along with Nick Khan after the departure of Vince McMahon who is her father. The former CEO who remains the company’s majority shareholder was found to have made payments of millions of dollars to multiple women to silence their claims of sexual harassment and misconduct.

WWE’s announcement of the promotions this morning signaled earlier in an SEC filing cited a 15% rise in viewership of Monday Night Raw on Levesque’s watch along with double-digit growth in social media engagement. In his new role Levesque will report to Khan and oversee creative writing talent relations live events talent development and creative services.

“Having spent my entire career in this business I’m confident that we have the right pieces in place to continue to grow our audience and deliver for our fans around the world” Levesque said.

Riddick had been CFO since joining the company last year in a prior shakeup of the executive suite and now has been given the additional title of president. He has been a board member of the company for more than 13 years. Riddick will jointly report to McMahon and Khan.

“I’ve had the great fortune of working closely with the talented people at WWE in a variety of capacities over the past 15 years” said Riddick. “Along with Steph Nick and Paul we look forward to executing our ambitious plans and delivering for our shareholders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVtaXN0cnl3b3JsZC5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvY2hhcmFjdGVyaXNhdGlvbi1hbmQtcHJvY2Vzcy1vcHRpbWlzYXRpb24tb2YtcmVjeWNsZWQtcmVzaW5zLWZvci10aGUtcG9seW1lci1pbmR1c3RyeS80MDE2MDgyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Characterisation and process optimisation of recycled resins for the polymer industry,"It is difficult to imagine a world without plastics. From the clothes we wear the items in our houses and the components in our cars to the way so many of the things we buy are packaged plastics are everywhere. But it is increasingly clear that useful as plastics are plastic waste is a massive and increasing problem.

Take plastic packaging. By its very nature it is likely to be thrown away once the product has been opened and used. But as the predominant application for thermoplastic resins the plastic packaging waste mountain is growing relentlessly. And as a major product of the petrochemical industry it is unsustainable at the start of its life as well as at the end of it.

Every part of the plastics value chain needs to adapt Els Verdonck senior applications scientist TA Instruments

Yet plastic is the obvious choice for packaging so many products. It’s lightweight and durable it provides safe and hygienic containment for food medicines and personal care products even reducing food spoilage and of course it is cost-effective. But despite efforts locally and nationally around the world recycling rates remain low.

If we are to continue using plastics then these recycling rates will certainly have to rise. Recycled resin is already finding its way back into every part of the supply chain from raw materials suppliers through polymer manufacturers masterbatchers and converters right through to reuse in end products. ‘This requires the plastics industry to innovate and develop new products’ says Els Verdonck senior applications scientist at the TA Instruments division of Waters Corporation. ‘Every part of the plastics value chain needs to adapt.’ And finding ways to make new virgin plastics from non-fossil fuel-based raw materials will also be essential in the drive towards a more sustainable future.

Mechanical recycling

The vast majority of plastic recycling is currently mechanical – essentially reusing the polymer in some way. This can be effective in reducing energy use and global warming impact compared to using virgin raw materials. But it also poses new challenges for plastics makers and users.

The variability and contamination in the plastic waste stream is inevitably a complicating factor for mechanical recycling and identifying exactly what is in the waste is going to be crucial to success. ‘All of a sudden the industry is moving from processing homogeneous virgin plastics to incorporating recycled content that can vary a lot from batch to batch’ Verdonck says. ‘Therefore proper fingerprinting and process optimisation becomes increasingly important.’

Waste plastic is delivered in bales to the mechanical recycling facility where it is first sorted and inspected by eye or with the assistance of infrared (IR) spectrometry and then washed before being chopped into small pieces. These flakes are fed into a sink–float tank where their relative densities mean polyolefins float while polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sinks. This helps to separate and decontaminate the waste stream although it is not infallible: a polyethylene bottle might have a polypropylene cap and both would float. Therefore another IR scanner might be used here too which might get the material up to about 98% pure.

However both these separation techniques tend to fail for multilayer films which might contain outer layers of polyethylene for food contact with further layers of polyamide to confer strength and other materials to give protection from oxygen. As these are all stuck together separating them is not simple.

After sorting and drying the polymer shards are melted and pelletised. These pellets can then be used to make new products.

The energy savings over using virgin resin are significant. Life cycle analysis from the US Association of Plastic Recyclers suggests that recycled PET for example cuts energy usage by about 80%. And the emissions of greenhouse gases can be reduced by as much as three-quarters too.

Checking for impurities

Despite the care taken to ensure the material that is mechanically recycled is as pure as possible analysing the reprocessed material is important and the results of this analysis can help guide reprocessing conditions. Both thermal analysis and rheology assessments have a great deal of value here.

Two techniques predominate for thermal analysis: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both give an insight into how variable waste plastic is which helps to decide how it might be processed more efficiently.

[Our] thermal and rheological instruments provide the most comprehensive analysis to polymer industries Terri Chen principal applications engineer TA Instruments

DSC measures how much heat is absorbed or released by a material sample during heating or cooling. This gives information about the material’s glass transition the temperature ranges of melting and crystallisation and even its oxidative stability. Only small samples are required – of the order of a few mg – and powders granules films and liquids can all be tested.

The technique can also be used to qualify and quantify organic contamination in recycled polymers which gives vital insight into how the polymer should be processed. Different polymers have distinct known glass transitions and melting temperatures so any unexpected peaks will indicate the presence of contaminants.

DSC can also assist in determining the best processing temperature for the resin as it allows the melting temperature range to be determined. The endset of the melting region will be the minimum temperature for processing because clearly the resin must be molten in order to be processed.

At the other end of the processing window TGA can be used to determine the maximum processing temperature. TGA measures how a material’s weight changes as a function of temperature or time which can be used to indicate the point at which a material begins to decompose as well as quantifying the volatiles present and it can even give some sense of the filler content within the resin.

Rheology – the science of flow and deformation of matter – can give further details about the polymer architecture such as molecular weight molecular weight distribution and long chain branching structure. ‘It provides a direct measurement of a polymer’s melt flow behaviour showing how stable the resin is at the processing conditions. A rheological analysis can also help to guide and optimise the processing temperature through measuring the melt viscosity change as a function of temperature’ says Terri Chen principal applications engineer at TA Instruments.

Advanced recycling and alternative inputs

While mechanical recycling is very sensitive to contamination in the waste stream advanced recycling can cope with less homogeneous plastic waste and can give much purer feedstock . This is achieved by chemically recycling the polymer in some way rather than simply reprocessing it. The downsides are that these techniques are less well developed than commercial technologies and can be a lot more energy intensive.

Depolymerisation is furthest advanced for polyesters (like PET) and polyamides. This takes the polymers back to their base monomers which are then repolymerised to make new resin. Conversion takes the concept a step further breaking the plastic down by gasification or pyrolysis into petrochemicals or even syngas returning it right to the start of the petrochemical chain. This is predominantly applied to polyolefins.

The other way in which the environmental impact of the plastics chain might be reduced is to use non-petrochemical sources as raw materials for the monomers and polymers. There has been a lot of interest in the potential of using bio-based raw materials instead of oil. This is still in its infancy but reasonable strides have been made in the polyurethane sector where bio-based polyols are already being used by shoe manufacturers for example. Capturing waste carbon dioxide streams might also be an option such as the EU Carbon4PUR project to convert off-gases from ArcelorMittal’s Marseille steelworks into monomers.

Even with mechanical recycling further work is required on better ways to sort waste into polymer types to facilitate recycling – and not all types of plastics can yet be recycled easily if at all. ‘How do you ensure the recycled plastic you receive is 100% pure – or at least has a higher level of purity?’ says Michael Onepe market development manager at TA Instruments. ‘And how can we design plastics so they can be recycled more easily?’

Indeed careful design of materials and products could greatly assist in ramping up recycling rates. Food packaging films for example might be made using fewer layers if this could be achieved without impacting performance and those layers might be made simpler to separate. Block copolymers might be added to immiscible recycled mixed polymers to enhance compatibility of the resulting plastic. Additives can also play an important role in recovering useful polymer resin. Antioxidant and antacid additives are generally included in virgin polymer systems but adding more to replenish those that are destroyed or degraded during processing can reduce damage to the polymer chains during reprocessing.

Scott Trenor principal scientist at Milliken cites the example of how the company’s DeltaMax® performance modifiers for polypropylene were able to help compatibilise plastic waste for a customer trying to incorporate recycled PP into an injection moulded garden seat. ‘They were having problems processing materials because of contamination mostly polyethylene in the recycling stream’ he says. ‘By using 1wt% of the additive they were able to increase the amount of recycled material from 40% to 90%.’ Further sustainability enhancements included a 20°C reduction in processing temperature and a 10% reduction in cycle time.

Fundamentally the introduction of recycled resins and alternative-sourced plastics into the supply chain will drive the need to reformulate both processes and products. Existing products will need to be updated so performance is maintained when recycled resin is incorporated for example. And there is also a need to look back upstream with polymer manufacturers designing resins that take into account future recycling. All this needs to be done while retaining the existing performance and – importantly – cost of virgin materials.

‘Whether working with recycled materials or looking to alternative polymer sources analytical characterisations will be a key contributor to success’ says Chen. ‘TA Instruments thermal and rheological instruments provide the most comprehensive analysis to polymer industries in product innovation troubleshooting and processing optimisation.’"

LaShawn Thomas who formerly represented Williams claimed to the Post that Williams was “left to die” by Schiller and her former business manager according to an Aug. 26 article.

“The real issue is that Wells Fargo through their adviser refused to grant Wendy access to her own accounts this includes the right to check her balance” Thomas said according to the Post.

“No bank should have the authority to do that” said Thomas who reportedly was responding to a recent online article that said Williams’ son had misused her American Express credit card. “No one attempted to gain access to any of Wendy’s accounts. The Wells Fargo adviser and [her former manager] were the only people with access. They left Wendy to die.”

The dispute between Wells Fargo and Williams has been going on since the winter. In February Wells Fargo claimed in a filing with the New York Supreme Court that Williams was incapacitated and needed a guardianship and in May a financial guardian was appointed to oversee her money according to reports.

A spokesperson for Wells Fargo Advisors declined to comment. LaShawn Thomas did not return a call on Tuesday morning to comment. It was not clear who currently represents Williams in the dispute.

Schiller has been registered with Wells Fargo Advisors since 2017 and is based in its midtown Manhattan branch according to her BrokerCheck profile. She is a wirehouse veteran and has previously worked at UBS Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.

In March Williams went on Instagram and claimed that Wells Fargo and Schiller were blocking her access to her cash as part of the guardianship battle.

The Chinese pharmaceutical firm is expected to win approval for the first phase of redevelopment of a 10-acre site at Estuary Business Park comprising a three-storey production facility.

Nearby retailer T J Morris which trades as Home Bargains hopes to build a 100000 sq ft warehouse on land east of Boulevard Retail Park in Speke. Both projects are tipped for approval by Liverpool City Council at its planning committee meeting on 13 September.

Beijing-headquartered Pharmaron Biologics operates from an existing facility on two Estuary sites it acquired from the previous occupier Allergan – part of US-based AbbVie – last March for $118.7m.

The building Pharmaron currently occupies with around 150 staff is called The Hub and sits on one side of Estuary Banks Road. This sits opposite a second building known as the NBC which has 10 acres of undeveloped land to the south. Pharmaron wants to develop this plot in three phases totalling around 400000 sq ft to expand its operations.

Under the first phase the company would build a 213000 sq ft production facility with offices laboratories and warehousing over three floors plus associated car parking. Liverpool City Council has recommended the planning application for approval on 13 September.

Later a second phase would see the construction of a multistorey car park with 350-400 spaces. The third phase would comprise a commercial warehouse and additional offices to consolidate operations from the Hub building on Leeward Drive onto a single site.

The first-phase application proposes a 16-metre-high production facility that is “appropriate for the setting and comparable to developments on similar sites elsewhere in the primarily industrial area” which comprises mainly single and two-storey purpose-built units council documents said. The car parking provision would include 20 electric vehicle charging points according to the plans.

Estuary Business Park is located five miles from Liverpool city centre close to the John Lennon international airport.

Also in Speke T J Morris is hoping to gain permission to build a speculative business unit totalling 100000 sq ft on a vacant five-acre site on the northern side of Speke Boulevard east of the Boulevard Retail Park which houses a Home Bargains flagship store and other retail units.

The site bounded by Pharmacy Road to the east and industrial or commercial uses within the Venture Point/Evans Road industrial area to the north used to be occupied by housewares company Rayware now based on Triumph Trading Park. The Boulevard site was left as a vacant development plot following the construction of the adjacent retail park in 2018 according to council documents.

Under the plans T J Morris’ business unit would comprise an 88000 sq ft warehouse 11000 sq ft of offices over two floors car parking a services yard and external works and landscaping.

Planning officers have recommended both projects for approval.

The T J Morris warehouse is planning application 22F/0849 and Pharmaron’s production facility is application 22F/1314 both with Liverpool City Council.",,,

That is because the Oct 21 2022 $25.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly options traders are pricing in a big move for Western Digital shares but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently Western Digital is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Computer- Storage Devices industry that ranks in the Top 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter while three analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.10 per share to 74 cents in that period.



Given the way analysts feel about Western Digital right now this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

Announced only in July this year Ultrastar DC HC570 22TB CMR HDDs can result in a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers and enterprise customers says the company.



“As India is witnessing massive data growth and therefore data centre expansion it is the right time to launch this 22TB CMR HDD in the country” Jaganathan Chelliah Senior Director – Marketing India Middle East & TIA Western Digital told Business Today. Additionally with the recently concluded 5G spectrum auction India is expecting the rollout of 5G services which will further amplify data and cloud usage to create huge demand for high-capacity drives to reduce TCO. Chelliah also said that this is the first of its kind innovation as the existing solution is available with a maximum of up to 20 TB capacity.



According to Western Digital this new 22TB CMR drive architecture extends capacity gains on proven ePMR technology and leverages industry-first technologies to deliver areal-density leadership on a mature 2.2TB/platter with ten disks. One of the new technology innovations is ArmorCache a feature uniquely enabled by OptiNAND that combines the performance of write cache enabled (WCE) mode and the data protection of write cache disabled (WCD) mode offering the best of both scenarios without compromise. When operating in WCE mode ArmorCache ensures that the DRAM cache will be safely written in event of an emergency power off (EPO) and no data is lost. When operating in WCD mode the drive will ensure that all user data in DRAM is safely written upon EPO and the drive will operate with WCE-equivalent performance. Performance and data protection are now identical across both WCE and WCD modes.



The company did not disclose the number of the new hard drives it intends to ship into the country but is hopeful of supplying the 22TB CMR HDD to the major hyper-scale data centres in India through its system integrators.

The KIOXIA XG8 Series is a client SSD that leverages the PCIe Gen4 NVMe 1.4 specification and is a direct successor to the company’s XG6 series. Featuring 5th-gen BiCS FLASH 3D TLC NAND KIOXIA is positioning the XG8 as a high-performance SSD for OEMs giving system builders a viable option for workstations gaming rigs and even light data center applications (e.g. server-boot caching and logging).

KIOXIA XG8 Series vs XG6/XG6-P Series

The XG8 is the second release in KIOXIA’s XG series. The biggest difference between the two Series is that the XG8 leverages the PCIe Gen4 interface versus the PCIe Gen3 in the XG6 which obviously means a significant difference in quoted performance:

XG6/XG6-P Series XG8 Series Capacity 256GB 512GB 1TB 2TB 512GB 1TB 2TB 4TB Sequential Read (MB/s) 3050 3100 3180 3180 7000 7000 7000 7000 Sequential Write (MB/s) 1550 2800 2960 2920 5000 5600 5800 5800 Random Read (KIOPS) 270 325 355 355 750 900 900 900 Random Write (KIOPS) 335 355 365 365 600 620 620 620

As you can see all capacities are quoted to deliver up to 7GB/s in sequential reads while potentially hitting up to 5.8GB/s in sequential writes. For random performance the XG8 is expected to reach 900K IOPS read and 620K IOPS write. KIOXIA also upped the capacity to 4TB in the XG8 and they now use the 5th generation BiCS FLASH.

KIOXIA XG8 Series Features

The XG8 series is available in the standard M.2 type 2280 form factor and comes with a range of optional security features that use the latest TCG Pyrite 2.01 and TCG Opal 2.01 standards. Moreover the XG8 Series is equipped with end-to-end data path protection and Power Loss Notification for improved data integrity and further peace of mind helping to keep your files safe against both forced and unexpected shut-downs.

The XG8 Series also features power consumption of 8.1W (or less) while in active mode and less than 3mW in standby mode the latter of which is noticeably less than drives like Kingston KC3000.

The 512GB – 2048GB capacities are single-sided M.2 SSDs while the 4TB model leverages a double-sided build.

The KIOXIA XG8 is available in capacities of 512GB 1TB 2TB and 4TB. We will be looking at the 2TB model for this review. Because KIOXIA has not mentioned warranty information for the drive it will likely be associated with the host system it is being sold with. Also there is no street pricing as this is an OEM offering only.

Testbed

As we migrate into testing newer NVMe Gen4 SSDs it required a platform shift in our lab to support the newer interface. We’ve also been migrating newer NVMe Gen3 SSDs to the same platform for better apples-to-apples comparisons between drive generations. For these reviews we leverage the Lenovo ThinkSystem SR635 server equipped with an AMD 7742 CPU and 512GB of 3200Mhz DDR4 memory.

NVMe is tested natively through an M.2 to PCIe adapter card in the edge-card slot while U.2 drives are loaded in the front. The methodology used better reflects end-user workflow with the consistency scalability and flexibility testing within virtualized server offers. A large focus is put on drive latency across the entire load range of the drive not just at the smallest QD1 (Queue-Depth 1) levels. We do this because many of the common consumer benchmarks don’t adequately capture end-user workload profiles.

For our added BlackMagic Disk Speed Test performed in Windows we use our self-built StorageReview desktop.

KIOXIA XG8 Performance

We are reviewing the 2TB version of the KIOXIA XG8 and will be comparing it to the following PCIe Gen4x4 drives:

SQL Server Performance

Each SQL Server VM is configured with two vDisks: 100GB volume for boot and a 500GB volume for the database and log files. From a system resource perspective we configured each VM with 16 vCPUs 64GB of DRAM and leveraged the LSI Logic SAS SCSI controller. While our Sysbench workloads tested previously saturated the platform in both storage I/O and capacity the SQL test is looking for latency performance.

This test uses SQL Server 2014 running on Windows Server 2012 R2 guest VMs and is stressed by Quest’s Benchmark Factory for Databases. StorageReview’s Microsoft SQL Server OLTP testing protocol employs the current draft of the Transaction Processing Performance Council’s Benchmark C (TPC-C) an online transaction-processing benchmark that simulates the activities found in complex application environments.

The TPC-C benchmark comes closer than synthetic performance benchmarks to gauging the performance strengths and bottlenecks of storage infrastructure in database environments. Each instance of our SQL Server VM for this review uses a 333GB (1500 scale) SQL Server database and measures the transactional performance and latency under a load of 15000 virtual users.

SQL Server Testing Configuration (per VM)

Windows Server 2012 R2

Storage Footprint: 600GB allocated 500GB used

SQL Server 2014

Database Size: 1500 scale Virtual Client Load: 15000 RAM Buffer: 48GB



Test Length: 3 hours 2.5 hours preconditioning 30 minutes sample period



Starting with SQL average latency the KIOXIA XG8 posted a decent 5ms which placed it in the middle part of the consumer NVMe SSD leaderboard.

VDBench Workload Analysis

When it comes to benchmarking storage devices application testing is best and synthetic testing comes in second place. While not a perfect representation of actual workloads synthetic tests do help to baseline storage devices with a repeatability factor that makes it easy to do apples-to-apples comparison between competing solutions. These workloads offer a range of different testing profiles ranging from “four corners” tests common database transfer size tests to trace captures from different VDI environments.

All of these tests leverage the common vdBench workload generator with a scripting engine to automate and capture results over a large compute testing cluster. This allows us to repeat the same workloads across a wide range of storage devices including flash arrays and individual storage devices. Our testing process for these benchmarks fills the entire drive surface with data then partitions a drive section equal to 1% of the drive capacity to simulate how the drive might respond to application workloads. This is different than full entropy tests which use 100% of the drive and take them into a steady state. As a result these figures will reflect higher-sustained write speeds.

Profiles:

4K Random Read: 100% Read 128 threads 0-120% iorate

4K Random Write: 100% Write 64 threads 0-120% iorate

64K Sequential Read: 100% Read 16 threads 0-120% iorate

64K Sequential Write: 100% Write 8 threads 0-120% iorate

Starting with 4K random read the KIOXIA XG8 showed a stable peak performance of 760K IOPS at 166.5 µs which was good enough for 4th place and right behind the WD drives.

The KIOXIA XG8 had a peak performance of 245K IOPS and 515.7µs for 4K writes placing 6th among the tested drive.

Moving onto sequential read 64K the KIOXIA XG8 has solid results peaking at 5.3GB/s (or 85K IOPS) with 377µs latency which was among the top performing drives (though the Kingston SSD was far ahead).

In sequential write 64K performance the KIOXIA XG8 posted very weak results showing a peak of 1.1GB/s (or 18K IOPS) at just 518µs latency.

Next we looked at our VDI benchmarks which are designed to tax the drives even further. These tests include Boot Initial Login and Monday Login. Starting with Boot the KIOXIA XG8 had a peak of 170k IOPS with a latency of 210.3µs which were solid results (placing 2nd).

Our VDI Initial Login showed some messy results across the board in our charts. It’s hard to see but the KIOXIA XG8 topped out at 48k IOPS (at 623.3ms) before it took then took a pretty serious spike in performance at the end.

Finally VDI Monday Login where results were pretty tough to determine unless you had the source files like us. That said the KIOXIA XG8 had solid results peaking at 34k IOPS with a latency of 274.7µs before for 2nd place among the tested drives.

KIOXIA XG8 Blackmagic Performance

Lastly is our Blackmagic transfer speed test where we measure transfer speeds inside our consumer test platform. Here the XG8 measured 5357.6MB/s read and 5174.2MB/s write.

Conclusion

The XG8 is another solid release from KIOXIA. Available in capacities up to 4TB and featuring 5th-gen 112-layer BiCS FLASH 3D NAND this OEM Gen4 client SSD will find itself inside a range of gaming content creation and professional systems. It also has important features to protect data against unexpected outages and shutdowns such as end-to-end data path protection and Power Loss Notification.

As far as its performance goes the KIOXIA XG8 produced great results and often found itself near the top part of the leaderboard in reads among the other TLC-based SSDs though write speeds were a little below par. Specifics include 760K IOPS in 4K random reads 245K IOPS in 4K random writes and 5.3GB/s (or 85K IOPS) in sequential reads. It did show fairly weak sequential write performance with a peak of 1.1GB/s (or just 18K IOPS). It also had decent results in SQL server performance posting 5ms in average latency.

Its solid performance continued during our VDI benchmarks tests that tax the drives even further. With our Boot profile the XG8 had a peak of 170K IOPS while initial and Monday login tests topped out at 48K IOPS and 34K IOPS respectively.

Overall the KIOXIA XG8 is another good addition to the OEM market posting above-average results in most of our tests particularly in read performance. System builders will likely find that the XG8 is well-suited for more performance-driven (yet affordable) workstations and pre-built rigs with power efficiency in mind.

Alber’s career at the specialty home furnishings chain which encompasses not only the namesake Williams-Sonoma stores but also Pottery Barn Pottery Barn Kids PBTeen West Elm and Mark and Graham began in 1995 as the senior buyer for the Pottery Barn catalog. She quickly moved up the ranks to director of the Pottery Barn catalog then president of Pottery Barn followed by president of Williams-Sonoma before taking on the CEO title and a spot on the board of directors 12 years ago.

During the height of the pandemic when businesses were closing their doors and laying off staff Alber took the bold step of keeping everyone employed as she related in a video interview for Saleforce’s Inflection Point series. And her decision paid off as not only did the company achieve a 300% increase in sales but also she witnessed the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit of associates who drove the company’s e-commerce business by pivoting to things such as online design chats with customers.

Today nearly 70% of the company’s business is via the direct-to-consumer channel. But Alber who takes a digital-first but not digital-only stance still sees a role for brick-and-mortar stores saying in the Inflection Point video: “Anybody who thinks it’s just online to build a brand I think is wrong. I think going to the store is the experience — the smell the people the help; some trusted expert who can help you decorate your home.”

As a working mother herself Alber continues to champion the role of women. Currently 55% of Williams-Sonoma’s executive positions are held by women and the majority of the board is now female. In August the company was named for the fourth consecutive year to Forbes’ list of America’s Best Employers for Women.

Leading in sustainability is another initiative Alber has put high on her agenda saying in the Inflection Point interview she wants the company to be No. 1 and noting Williams-Sonoma was the only home furnishings retailer on Barron’s 2022 Top 100 list of sustainable U.S. companies.

Among the company’s sustainability-related goals are reducing emissions across its value chain by 2030 with a goal of carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2025; planting 3 million trees by 2023; and engaging its vendor community to have 75% of products sourced from suppliers that offer worker well-being programs by 2030.

Correspondent

Ricky Williams is an enigma.

In his NFL days this was often intimidating to members of the sports media who all too often are seeking tidy narratives featuring flat predictable characters. But If you try to contain Ricky with your preconceived notions you’re likely to have just as little success as linebackers had in containing him on the gridiron.

At the University of Texas he won the Heisman trophy and smashed just about every school record imaginable. He then moved on to the pros where he ran for over 10000 career yards — despite multiple suspensions for cannabis use and the fact that many of his teammates were puzzled by his quiet philosophical personality.

Today he’s president and co-founder of Highsman a cannabis lifestyle brand. It's the latest chapter in a story where Ricky has consistently defied expectations of how an athlete is supposed to behave.

Highsman flower products hit shelves in Massachusetts dispensaries this month. For more information visit www.highsman.com.

You were recently in Massachusetts checking out the local cannabis scene. What were your thoughts?

Williams: I was excited about spreading Highsman to the East Coast but I realized I didn’t know much about the Massachusetts market. I spent some time in Boston but the majority of the time I was in the NFL’s drug program so I wasn’t part of the cannabis community there.

The first thing I was impressed with was the quality of the flower. I think sometimes we get full of ourselves in California we think we do everything best and we hear stories about people in other markets struggling to grow quality flower. It makes sense that if you get quality people growing the flower who have some experience they’re going to figure it out.

The next part was the thing I was probably the most shocked about. The guys decided we were going to landmarks that people would recognize and get some footage. We were walking next to Fenway and smoking a joint and there was this weird authentic moment where you could see how people’s brains work. People were walking down the street and they smell [the cannabis] and think “huh.” Then they see the cameras and they think “okay must be someone famous.” Then they see me and they’re like “Ricky Williams!”

I made a joke when I spoke at an event in Massachusetts that this was the first time being on stage in New England where I wasn’t being booed. We’re all on the same team.

There was probably no shortage of companies that Highsman could have worked with in Massachusetts. Why did Highsman choose a large company like TILT?

WIlliams: We have strategic conversations about going into each market. We decided that most of our energy is focused on the West so if we’re going to the East Coast let’s talk to some multi-state operators.

There’s people out there that are just in it for the margins. if you’re a publicly traded company you have to be to a certain extent. But every time we interacted with TILT they were saying all the right things — that they wanted to grow quality flower at scale that they wanted to be connected to the company. After I heard that time and time again and it kept checking out I decided I really wanted to work with TILT.

To create a sustainable business in cannabis it has to be attached to some kind of lifestyle that people can live their entire lives. Cookies are doing a wonderful job but it’s hard to imagine someone living that Cookies lifestyle their entire lives. It’s kind of something you grow out of. I feel like this idea of consuming cannabis and really going to that mental place where you think “how could I improve my life?” and then you come out and do something about it that’s something you can do your whole life.

Obviously you got into some trouble with the NFL for your cannabis use but did you ever have any close run-ins with law enforcement involving cannabis?

Williams: Yeah I was fortunate enough that it didn’t happen when cannabis was still a big deal.

A couple years ago I was in Harris County Texas — where cannabis is decriminalized. I was with a friend who was driving and I didn’t realize we had just left Harris County. We were pulled over for speeding and the cop saw a sack of cannabis on the floorboard. He asked whose it was and I thought it was decriminalized so I said “it’s mine!” [laughs]

The cop asked me to step out of the car and then put me in cuffs. I was so happy it happened because I’ve heard stories about how cannabis has been used as a weapon against communities. The cop told me “If I knew who you were I would have let you go.”

I was sitting there being booked and I saw a ton of people coming in for the same thing. Hearing them talk about how it was used to get people into the system I was like “Damn.”

I was lucky. It was during COVID and I had a beard so no one recognized me during booking.

No one recognized Ricky Williams in Texas?!?!

Williams: It didn’t even get to the news! The universe was looking out for me.

I reached out to a friend of mine who is connected in Houston and he got me a good attorney. When I got to court the judge happened to be the wife of one of my college teammates! [laughs]

I had to do community service and go through the process but I was fortunate. A lot of people don’t have the connection or resources but have my skin color aren’t as lucky.

What was your most memorable game in New England?

Williams: My first year in Miami we beat the Patriots in Miami and for the last game of the season we went up to play in New England. If we win the game we’re in the playoffs. I was in the running for leading rusher so if I had a good game and we won that would have been great.

I had a good game I think I had 183 rushing yards. We’re winning by like 14 with four minutes. We throw an interception they tie it and then they beat us in overtime.

It was this amazing year and it all came to an end in four minutes.

What do you think it would be like to smoke weed with Bill Belichick? Would he open up a bit?

Williams: Once he was over the taboo aspect of it and we were just sitting there talking I think it would be great. To me once you get comfortable with it I feel that cannabis can unlock certain insights or connections. So I’d love to sit with Bill and just talk about personnel.

I know Bill’s dad was an amazing scout and one thing about the Patriots is they get the most out of their talent. So I would love to smoke and talk to Bill about that.

Nearly three-quarters (70 per cent) of neurodivergent employees experience mental health issues a study from Willis Towers Watson (WTW) has found leading to calls for better employer support.

WTW’s Global Benefits Attitude Survey which looked at data from 4129 people employed by mid to large companies at the beginning of this year found that only a quarter (25 per cent) of neurodivergent employees felt financially secure and emotionally balanced while a third (36 per cent) felt they had good physical health.

Half (50 per cent) reported feeling burnt out at work compared to just 38 per cent of neurotypical employees. Three in five (59 per cent) neurodivergent employees had deferred healthcare compared to 29 per cent of other employees.

Becoming an inclusive employer of the future

“We’re supercharging the workplace with neurodiverse skillsets”

Why you need inclusive and diverse teams to create belonging

Deferred care includes that which has either been delayed or cancelled by the patient or the provider. It meant almost three-quarters (72 per cent) of neurodivergent employees had faced adverse healthcare from delaying or cancelling their treatment.

Lucy McGrath wellbeing expert at WTW highlighted a growing focus on the role of benefits in delivering inclusive care for employees and an increased list of healthcare providers that support assessment and diagnosis of neurodivergent conditions.

“There are varying levels of support and intervention that a company can engage with such as using insights and benchmarking and engaging in workshops to build an inclusive care strategy – but doing something is better than nothing” she said.

According to the study more than a third (39 per cent) of employees were looking for a greater focus on benefits that manage their emotional health and a similar percentage (38 per cent) would like more flexibility.

Neurodivergent employees also leant towards support for day-to-day finances: almost three in five (57 per cent) reported living payday to payday compared to only 34 per cent of neurotypical employees.

However two-thirds (67 per cent) of neurodivergent workers said employers have made progress in showing greater understanding around issues of inclusion diversity and discrimination.

Nearly three-quarters (71 per cent) had noticed greater visibility of inclusion and diversity as a business issue and two-thirds (67 per cent) said employers have become more open about these issues at work.

A separate survey from WTW which looked at responses from 173 employees in June and July this year found that a third (38 per cent) of companies had incorporated inclusion and diversity policies into their benefits offering.

Another WTW survey of 166 employers in January this year found that one in five (20 per cent) employers had already implemented benefits designed to support neurodivergent employees while a quarter (24 per cent) of employers were planning to do so.

Ngozi Weller director of Aurora Wellness who has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) said the findings were unsurprising and stressed there was a strong link between neurodiversity and mental health issues. “When the neurodivergent individual like myself doesn’t receive the kind of support they need then it is easy for that anxiety to be compounded by things like depression” she said.

She recalled her own experience after receiving her diagnosis the lack of understanding from her employer in terms of putting things in place to support her at work and said employers hoping get the best out of their workforce should put “safe avenues” in place for neurodivergent employees and focus on providing bespoke solutions for a variety of neurotypes.

Kirsty Garshong associate director at Harnham who is also neurodivergent said such employees should be treated as added value to a business and not as a challenge to employers. Hiring processes need to be improved to see a candidate's talents and how to bring out the best in people she added.

Language in interviews must be changed from asking poorly framed questions about ‘learning difficulties’ and ‘needing extra support’ to “asking how someone learns best or what equipment they might find helpful day to day such as a dictaphone”.

“It pays to be flexible… and to educate yourself on different neurological groups” she said.

Isabel Collins founder of Belonging Space said employers should focus on reaching out for the right talent and individualising support; some with ADHD may need additional support around breaking down tasks while those with dyslexia can benefit from simple voice tech.

Others may feel drained from social interaction and will need quiet working areas she said. “Social interactions may feel stressful and finding ways to include all members within a team will be reassuring and important [for employers]” she added."

The messages rolled in as I posted during and after Thursday night’s opener at the Encore Theater. “Marrying Simon LeBon was on my bucket list!” and “I was certain I was going to marry Simon LeBon in the ‘80s” and “It was Simon LeBon then John Taylor if Simon didn’t work out.”

Such widespread naivete is the byproduct of early 1980s MTV fame. Duran Duran ruled that network just after its inception. LeBon John Taylor Nick Rhodes and Roger Taylor might all be in their 60s now (well not might — they are) but can still rock to telegenic effect as they showed in their debut at Wynn Las Vegas.

The band returns Saturday and again Oct. 30 and 31 for Halloween-themed shows. The guys are filling the room and fast though LeBon makes it seems as if its not such a challenge. “Compared to the places we normally play” he said at the start of Friday’s show “this seems like a well-appointed bathroom.”

What was reinforced in the Encore lid-lifter was there is so much more to Duran Duran than their days cavorting through “Rio” “Girls on Film” and “Wild Boys.” The band is a powerhouse the riffs are rad and the volume is jacked up. There’s little debate that Duran Duran is worthy of its Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nod. That induction is coming in November.

The ballads scored too.”Ordinary World” was a moving dedication to the people of Ukraine. The high-ascending “Save a Prayer” showed LeBon at his finest a song that caused the crowd to sway.

And I have argued this point with James Bond fans for years: My favorite Bond theme is “A View to a Kill” with its wild synthesizer and Taylor’s rumbling low-end bass. They played this during “Live Aid” kids and are playing it again. The crowd roared through the “dance into the fire” refrain as if singing to a new Bond song.

And “Invisible” and “All of You” off the band’s latest release “Future Past” showed Duran Duran is not flagging some 40-plus years after forming.

The band displayed visual splash of course LeBon in silver slacks a bright-green leather jacket and a series of T-shirts (ending with “Union” over a snake so you are reminded of the title of that hit song). John Taylor is still whippet-thin and effectively tattooed. The platinum-maned Rhodes especially has not changed his look over the past 40 years.

As this was a weeknight in VegasVille many locals turned out in the sold-out audience. Seated around the venue were UFC President Dana White SPI Entertainment exec Alex Schechter Vegas bass virtuoso Steve Flora and the ever-rocking Todd Kerns (of Raiding the Rock Vault) who was seated to my right.

Different personality types for sure. But we stood the whole time and we all knew the words.

Sandra Douglass Morgan is one of us.

Her dad was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base and her mom was keno runner at some of the city’s most beloved properties the old Showboat and Imperial Palace.

Now she’s one of the guiding forces of the Las Vegas Raiders after being hired this summer as the team’s president.

It’s been a fast-moving two months on the job for Douglass Morgan who is no stranger to being in the public eye in her hometown.

The Eldorado High School graduate is a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission chairwoman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board board of directors member for Caesars Entertainment and commissioner for the Nevada Athletic Commission.

“My mother worked swing shift and worked holidays” Morgan said last month at a diversity town hall at Wynn Las Vegas. “We’d celebrate Christmas but usually before Christmas. As the daughter of someone who was a keno runner at casinos being appointed to the (Gaming Commission) was something that was a huge source of pride for my mother.”

Douglass Morgan touched on a variety of issues in her comments at the town hall including being the first Black woman to serve as an NFL franchise president. Here are some highlights:

Doing what’s best for the Raiders

Morgan doesn’t spend much time ruminating about how she’s a trailblazer in the league — though she’s constantly asked about it.

And it’s not the initial time she’s broken barriers.

She was also the first Black city attorney in Nevada history when in 2013 North Las Vegas hired her for that position. And at Caesars she was one of just a handful of Blacks serving on the board of directors of a major Strip casino company.

“You don’t want to be seen as this is the position you’re getting because of your race gender religion or orientation” said Morgan a graduate of UNR and the Boyd School of Law at UNLV. “You’re getting the position because you’re qualified; you just happen to maybe look a little different or come from a nontraditional sect but that doesn’t take away from your value with the position.”

With that said Morgan was aware of what she might represent for many.

“I don’t listen to it” Morgan said. “I just move forward and do a good job and do what’s best for the Raiders. My work will speak for itself but I also encourage people to be inclusive and be a good ally for people.”

Raiders history of inclusion

Decades ago former Raiders owner Al Davis the late father of current owner Mark Davis referred to a “Commitment to Excellence” that he expected people in the organization to have.

Morgan said the history of the team also included instances where the elder Davis and others publicly worked toward diversity and inclusion.

Morgan didn’t realize until after she accepted the job that Al Davis had supported a boycott of the 1965 American Football League all-star game in New Orleans after players arrived in the city because of racist acts they encountered.. The game was moved to Houston after the players and Davis then coach and general manager of the Raiders spoke out about the injustices.

Davis alsotapped Tom Flores as the team’s starting quarterback in 1960 the AFL’s inaugural year making him the first Latino to start at quarterback in a professional football league. Flores later went on to become a Hall of Fame coach for the Raiders.

In 1989 Davis hired the modern NFL’s first Black head coach Art Shell for what was then the Los Angeles Raiders.

“The Raiders have a rich history on diversity and inclusion” Morgan said. “For Al Davis to make that move in 1965 that was incredibly bold. Even though I never had a chance to meet him I think part of his legacy and that ‘Raider Way’ is also about giving people opportunities and maybe finding those non-traditional candidates.”

Don’t worry about checking the boxes

Morgan said she prides herself on taking positions that place her out of her comfort zone.

She said she noticed that women sometimes didn’t take the time to pursue a certain job unless they “check every box” of a job requirements listing.

“I tell people to go ahead and try it because they’ll learn from that experience” she said. “I had to challenge myself to try this job. I think we have to go into situations optimistic believing that it will work. There are studies that show women are less likely to apply for a position if they don’t hit all those boxes. I want to say don’t worry about hitting those boxes.”

Raising value

In her role Morgan doesn’t make player personnel decisions but rather is responsible for other aspects of the franchise’s business.

One of her main tasks in the role she said is to help increase the franchise’s value. According to this year’s annual Forbes report that lists the most valuable NFL franchises the Raiders are worth about $5.1 billion — the ninth most valuable franchise in the 32-team NFL.

It’s not likely the Raiders will catch the most valuable NFL franchise anytime soon — the Dallas Cowboys are valued at over $8 billion according to Forbes — but moving to Las Vegas in 2020 has raised the team’s profile on the balance sheet.

“We want to make sure we’re retaining fans in Oakland and Los Angeles and everywhere else but we also want people growing up in Las Vegas to know we’re here” Morgan said. “Of course I want to help increase the value of the team and increase revenue from events at the stadium. Personally I also want to make sure everyone in our organization and doing business with the Raiders knows that they’re partnering with an organization that believes in them and believes in Las Vegas.”

As for results on the field Morgan said the goal is clear.

“Hopefully we’ll be playing in the Super Bowl after this season in Arizona and in the 2024 Super Bowl in Las Vegas” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXN3ZWVrbHkuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy9nYWxsZXJpZXMvMjAyMi9zZXAvMDYvZHVyYW4tZHVyYW4tZW5jb3JlLXRoZWF0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duran Duran at Encore Theater,

Available here in Minnesota too under the name AC Rewards it allows the utility to control the temperature of your home during an emergency in exchange for an annual discount of $25 and an initial enrollment rebate of $100.

Last Tuesday a combination of soaring temperatures and lost capacity from a power plant going offline in the Centennial State led to an energy crunch. The thermostats were remotely locked for hours causing over 22000 customers to roast. Some said the mercury inside their house went as high as 88 degrees.

This was the first time an emergency was declared in Colorado since the service began. Roughly 45600 customers are enrolled in AC Rewards across the country overall.

California and other western states have suffered a range of problems under a persistent heat wave that continued into this week. California is begging customers to avoid charging electric vehicles during peak demand hours and asking everyone to turn their thermostats up to at least 78 degrees to help ease strain on the grid there.

About 22000 Xcel customers lost control of their smart thermostats for hours on August 30th Denver7 News reports. That led to backlash on social media as some people said the temperatures inside their homes reached as high as 88 degrees Fahrenheit. Outdoor temperatures climbed into the 90s that day across parts of Colorado as much of the western US grappled with sweltering heat.

All of the customers affected had enrolled in an energy-saving program called AC Rewards that’s meant to ease the strain on the power grid during heatwaves. Xcel can adjust those customers’ smart thermostats when demand gets so high that there might not be enough supply to meet it. Xcel offers a one-time $100 credit on electricity bills upon signing up and $25 a year afterward for participation.

Extreme heat is stressing out power grids across much of the Western US

When the utility adjusts a customer’s thermostat the customer typically has the option to opt-out. But “On rare occasions system emergencies may cause a control event that cannot be overridden” the company says on its website.

Last week was the first time Xcel barred customers from overriding their adjustments in the six years since the program started according to Denver7. High temperatures soaring power demand for air conditioners and an unexpected outage all contributed to last week’s energy emergency Xcel vice president Emmett Romine told Denver7. Xcel did not immediately respond to a press inquiry from The Verge.

Extreme heat is stressing out power grids across much of the Western US during a prolonged heatwave that started last week and is expected to linger well into this week. California’s grid operator has urged residents to conserve energy over the next several days to avoid blackouts.

Americans are facing growing power interruptions compared to the past in part because of more extreme weather. 2020 was a record year for power outages in the US. Punishing summer heat in Texas last year triggered a similar backlash from residents when utilities set customers’ smart thermostats to higher temperatures to limit power demand.

Such programs are part of a strategy called demand response that’s supposed to help power grids become more resilient to extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and severe as global temperatures rise. Energy providers are always managing a precarious balance between supply and demand that can quickly lead to power outages during demand peaks. Demand response can smooth out those peaks which typically spike when heatwaves drive up demand for electricity to power air conditioning. So while some customers might see their thermostats set to higher temperatures than they anticipated that’s supposed to help power stay on for their households and their neighbors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbG9sYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhcGl0b2wtbmV3cy1idXJlYXUvc2QtY3VzdG9tZXJzLXN0YXJ0LXRvLWZpZ2h0LXhjZWxzLXByb3Bvc2VkLXJhdGUtaGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SD customers start to fight Xcel's proposed rate hike,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.keloland.com/news/capitol-news-bureau/sd-customers-start-to-fight-xcels-proposed-rate-hike/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbG9sYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhcGl0b2wtbmV3cy1idXJlYXUvc2QtY3VzdG9tZXJzLXN0YXJ0LXRvLWZpZ2h0LXhjZWxzLXByb3Bvc2VkLXJhdGUtaGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcjcuY29tL25ld3MvY29udGFjdC1kZW52ZXI3L3hjZWwtbWF5LXVzZS1hLWMtY29udHJvbC1wcm9ncmFtcy1tb3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel may use A/C control programs more,"When the Denver metro hit 90 degrees last week Contact Denver7 received several emails from people upset about Xcel's Colorado AC Rewards program. Customers received a message on their smart thermostats letting them know their temperature was locked due to an energy emergency and they could not override the lock.

Since Contact Denver7's story aired we have been doing some digging into this and have been in close contact with Xcel about these concerns.

Shen Lisa Bledsoe's Greeley home hit 80 degrees last Tuesday afternoon she thought her air conditioner was broken and shelled out $99 for a service call.

""Then they came out and the guy just turned it right on. ""There's nothing wrong with this"""" she said. ""I felt so stupid until I saw the story you did. I realized maybe that's what happened.""

Bledsoe said she confirmed with Xcel that she is not on the AC Rewards program. However a decade ago she signed up for the Saver Switch Program which ""cycled her air conditioner"" for several hours on Saturday with no warning.

The story has been heating up on social media with thousands of shares and perspectives ranging from ""Oh good we're California now"" to ""You signed up for it."" But some Xcel customers said they did not sign up for the AC Rewards program.

""I've never signed up for that program. I've never gotten any rewards. And they still took control of my thermostat"" said Thomas Nunley who saw his thermostat locked last week with no notification. ""When I called Xcel they said they didn't have any supervisors on hand that could talk to me and that they would get back to me. And that never happened. That's been over a week.""

Xcel said customers on these load management programs voluntarily sign up to receive incentives. They also need to be aware that Xcel can have some control of their air conditioning. Also the option may be used more often.

""We've had a lot of hot summer this summer and we're going to see more opportunities for these programs to be used I think as heat continues so I think I think it's something to keep in mind"" said Emmett Romine Xcel's vice president of customer solutions and innovation. ""It's possible we'll see some additional events if the heat continues to rise.""

Many customers told Contact Denver7 that is fine if they know in advance.

""You need to be notified by the company. As the consumer that's only fair"" said Bledsoe.

Is Xcel going to be more proactive about notification?

""Yeah I think that's a terrific point"" said Romine. ""Anytime we run programs like this we're looking at opportunities to improve communications because communications is key... we want to make sure people know what's happening why that's happening and keep them informed.""

Dallas-based Ampex Brands on Tuesday gave a preview of a new prototype scheduled to open next year in the northeast U.S. — the company can’t reveal exactly where just yet. Ampex Brands a Yum Brands franchisee and 7-Eleven operator in 2021 acquired Au Bon Pain from Panera Brands and started growing the brand again.

Beth Collins Ampex Brands’ global chief marketing officer said the new Café of the Future design follows a campaign of “bringing it back to bright.”

Since most units are in commuter hospital or university settings the airy new look is designed to help guests get in and out quickly to get on their way.

“What we really wanted to focus on in this redesign is how our guests primarily use the brand and what our point of differentiation is” said Collins in an interview. “We are a commuter brand. People are catching trains catching planes getting to the office. They need to get in and out.”

The streamlined design puts grab-and-go options refrigerated goods and the coffee bar right up front for example. Mobile kiosks will allow guests to scan their items and pay to avoid standing in lines.

Sandwich makers are on site for guests who want their meal made fresh to order. An island offers soups to go and helps manage the flow of guests through the unit Collins said.

Created in partnership with the firm Rubber & Road the design embraces the brand’s signature yellow. Artwork aims to accentuate the brand’s French bakery roots with images that spotlight the brand’s bakers floor tiles that say “bonjour” and a neon sign saying “bon bon bon.”

“We want to make sure we own ‘bon’” said Collins. “We meet you we greet you and we set you on your way to do great things.”

The first unit will be about 2000 square feet but the design can be applied to formats as small as 900 square feet said Collins

The first new prototype is a new unit to be developed by an unidentified existing Au Bon Pain franchisee who also signed a 10-unit development agreement for the northeast region.

Collins said new units will begin incorporating some elements of the new design. And the company’s 43 company locations will begin a paced-out remodel process to bring those units up to the new look.

Operators of the chain’s 76 franchised locations of Au Bon Pain are “chomping at the bit” to get started with the new design said Collins.

In addition to Au Bon Pain Ampex Brands recently acquired the Texas-based brand Bellagreen. The operator also has more than 400 franchised Yum Brands locations and operates 7-Eleven convenience stores.
