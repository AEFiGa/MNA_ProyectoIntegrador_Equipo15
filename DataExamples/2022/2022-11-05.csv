Anti-Coca-Cola protestors on Sunday staged a protest in front of the company’s defunct plant at Plachimada on Sunday condemning the involvement of Coca-Cola in hosting the 27th Conference of Parties (COP 27) of the United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Egypt from Sunday.

Burning effigies of Coca-Cola the protestors demanded that the multinational beverage company be removed from the sponsorship of the COP-27. A bicycle rally was taken out from Palakkad town to Plachimada in the morning.

Although Coca-Cola stopped its operations at Plachimada following a series of agitations the company refused to pay any compensation as recommended by a high-level committee headed by former Chief Secretary K. Jayakumar.

During investigation the panel had found that the company caused extensive damage to people and their land at Plachimada. It also recommended a compensation of Rs. 216.26 crore.

Inaugurating the protest environmentalist C.R. Neelakandan demanded that the United Nations should intervene to seek damages from Coca-Cola for the victims of Plachimada. He said that allowing the firm which dumps crores of plastic bottle as waste every day to sponsor the climate change conference was unfair.

Presiding over the function Plachimada Anti-Coca-Cola Struggle Committee chairman Vilayodi Venugopal said that they would expose the true nature of Coca-Cola by joining hands with other environmental groups from different parts of the world. “Coca- Cola has cheated the people of Plachimada by denying compensation to them” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvY2EtY29sYS5jb20vYmQvZW4vbWVkaWEtY2VudGVyL2Nva2Utc3R1ZGlvLWJhbmdsYS1jb25jZXJ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coke Studio Bangla Concert: The night music won against pessimism,"Let us address the elephant in the room first: Coke Studio Bangla is obviously an elaborate advert for Coca Cola.

Messier 77 has an apparent magnitude of 9.6 and lies at a distance of 47 million light-years.

The galaxy was discovered by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain in 1780 who originally identified it as a nebula.

Méchain then communicated the discovery to his colleague French astronomer Charles Messier.

Messier believed that the highly luminous object he saw was a cluster of stars but as technology progressed its true status as a galaxy was realized.

At 100000 light-years across Messier 77 is one of largest galaxies in the Messier catalogue — so massive that its gravity causes other nearby galaxies to twist and become warped.

Messier 77 is also one of the closest galaxies with an active galactic nucleus. Such active galaxies are among the brightest objects in the Universe and emit light at most if not all wavelengths from gamma rays and X-rays all the way to microwaves and radiowaves.

It is also a Type II Seyfert galaxy characterized by being particularly bright at infrared wavelengths.

“A supermassive black hole obscured by cosmic dust powers the nearby active galaxy Messier 77” said Dr. Gary Hill an astrophysicist in the Department of Physics at the University of Adelaide and a member of the IceCube Collaboration.

“Neutrinos which rarely interact with matter could provide information on the galaxy’s active core.”

“We searched for neutrino emission from astrophysical objects using data recorded with the IceCube neutrino detector between 2011 and 2020.”

In 2018 IceCube found the first ever source of neutrinos emitted by TXS 0506+056 — a blazar located off the left shoulder of the Orion constellation and 4 billion light-years away — from which super-massive black hole-powered particle jets pointing straight at Earth emit neutrinos.

This led to the joint observations over a short time period of neutrinos and gamma-rays.

Messier 77 is about 100 times closer and around 80 neutrino events have so far been identified from the active galaxy.

In contrast to the TXS 0506+056 blazar Messier 77 is oriented relative to Earth in such a way that a direct view of the central emitting region is obscured by dust. Gamma-rays are absorbed but the neutrinos can escape uninhibited from these regions.

“After the excitement in 2018 of the discovery of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 it’s even more thrilling to find a source producing a steady stream of neutrinos that we can see with IceCube” Dr. Hill said.

“The fact that neutrinos can escape from within these otherwise-obscured regions of the Universe means they are also hard to detect.”

“This requires large detectors like IceCube which is the current leader in the field with an instrumented volume of a cubic kilometer of deep South Pole ice.”

Many neutrinos pass clear through the Earth but some interact in the ice near the detector and create muons which emit flashes of light that are picked up by IceCube’s more than 5000 basketball-sized optical sensors spread over 86 strings deployed into holes drilled to nearly 2500 m depth and now permanently frozen into the deep ice.

The patterns of light are used to infer the arrival directions and energies of the particles.

“One of the best aspects of my research journey so far has been the time I have spent at the South Pole over many summer seasons working on the installation teams deploying the detector strings into the ice” Dr. Hill said.

“The enormous size of IceCube required many years of effort from hundreds of people around the world to complete construction and understand the response to high energy particles.”

“In a few years we’ll be back to the South Pole to put more instruments into the ice as part of an effort to further improve the detector.”

The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Science.

NASA

The two large spiral galaxies visible in this image – which flank a smaller unrelated background spiral galaxy – appear connected by a luminous bridge. This elongated stream of stars and interstellar dust is known as a tidal tail and it formed by the mutual gravitational attraction of the two foreground galaxies.

This observation comes from a project which delves into two galleries of weird and wonderful galaxies: A Catalogue of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations compiled by astronomers Halton Arp and Barry Madore and the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies compiled by Halton Arp. Each collection contains a menagerie of spectacularly peculiar galaxies including interacting galaxies such as Arp 248 as well as one- or three-armed spiral galaxies galaxies with shell-like structures and a variety of other space oddities.

Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys scoured this assortment of eccentric galaxies in search of promising candidates for future observations with the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and Hubble itself. With the wealth of astronomical objects to study in the night sky projects such as this which guide future observations are a valuable investment of observing time.

Defense pivotal for Corning

Corning countered Ithaca's big-hitting outside hitters with sparkling defensive play to beat the Little Red 25-18 25-12 28-26 and earn its first sectional title since 2016.

The Hawks' offense benefited from a combination of finesse and power in beating Ithaca for the first time in three tries this season. The Little Red (12-2) won by scores of 3-2 and 3-0 during the regular season to earn the Southern Tier Athletic Conference West Division crown.

Ithaca's bid to extend Saturday's match was denied after Corning rallied from a 19-13 hole to capture the final set.

What's Next: Corning (13-4) will play the Section 9 champion in a sub-regional at 5 p.m. Nov. 9 at Corning-Painted Post. The regional final is scheduled for 4 p.m. Nov. 11 at John Jay Cross River High School in Westchester County.

Vestal adds another title

Vestal added a Section 4 title to the Southern Tier Athletic Conference tournament championship the Golden Bears claimed last week with a win against Ithaca. Vestal earned its second straight sectional championship.

The Golden Bears took the first two sets by scores of 25-22 and 25-15. Union-Endicott bounced back for a 27-25 win in the third set before Vestal closed out the match 25-15.

What's Next: Vestal (13-3) will face the Section 9 champion in a sub-regional at 5 p.m. Nov. 9 at Vestal High School. The regional final against the Section 1 champion follows at 1:30 p.m. Nov. 11 at John Jay Cross River.

M-E ends Owego's title streak

On the brink of seeing its season come to an end in the fourth and fifth sets Maine-Endwell closed the match with four consecutive points and denied Owego Free Academy's bid for an 11th consecutive sectional championship.

The Spartans trailed 24-21 in set No. 4 before rallying to win by a 28-26 score. Owego led the fifth set 13-11 before the Spartans surged to a 15-13 victory.

Maine-Endwell opened the match with a 25-21 win. Owego (14-2) took the next two sets by scores of 25-8 and 25-18.

What's Next: Maine-Endwell (9-4) will take on the Section 9 champion in a sub-regional at 5 p.m. Nov. 9 at Owego Free Academy. The regional final against the Section 1 champion is set for 11 a.m. Nov. 11 at John Jay Cross River.

In fact the San Diego chip maker will apparently enjoy an influx of increased revenue until 2025 but that still does not mean Apple will completely sever its relationship with the company.

Qualcomm Was Earlier Reported to Only Supply Apple With 20 Percent of the Latter’s Overall 5G Modems for iPhones in 2023

Apple started development work on its own 5G modem in 2020 but even after acquiring Intel’s modem chip business the technology giant has been unable to get positive results. We reported earlier that Qualcomm would be the sole supplier of the chips found in the iPhone 15 series arriving next year but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman states that the company may enjoy this exclusivity three years from now.

“Qualcomm now believes it will supply the majority of Apple’s modems in 2023. In fact the company implied it might do so until 2025. That means Qualcomm will continue to get a solid revenue stream from Apple’s large iPhone volumes. It also suggests Apple’s in-house initiative is running behind.”

Apple and Qualcomm previously entered into a legal battle but eventually the situation quelled and both entered into a six-year deal back in 2019. Given that Qualcomm develops the very best in cutting-edge 5G modems Apple will have little choice but to stick with the supplier regardless if it gets livid over having to pay a premium to use those chips in current-generation and future iPhone models.

A previous report stated that Apple’s in-house solution will not be ready until 2025 and even if it does it is unclear on what percentage of iPhones will those 5G modems be used. Having an in-house solution mass-produced does not mean Apple will immediately cut off its business partnership with Qualcomm as we foresee the latter continuing to supply iPhone chips in the future albeit in a lower quantity.

Developing an in-house 5G modem has more complexities than an A-series or M-series SoC such as working properly on a variety of networks and at different frequencies. This is just the tip of the iceberg and was ultimately the reason why Apple had nothing to gain from resuming its legal skirmishes with Qualcomm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ29yZG9ua2VsbHkvMjAyMi8xMS8wNi9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTUtcHJvLW1heC11bHRyYS1xdWFsY29tbS1hcHBsZS1tb2RlbS1mZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Supplier Confirms iPhone 15 Component Plans,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ29yZG9ua2VsbHkvMjAyMi8xMS8wNi9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTUtcHJvLW1heC11bHRyYS1xdWFsY29tbS1hcHBsZS1tb2RlbS1mZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF29120B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones have traditionally used Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipsets which were available in select markets such as the US while other markets get the Exynos variants.

According to Android Central chief financial officer Akash Palkhiwala during Qualcomm’s recent investor call confirmed that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S23 models would be powered by Snapdragon chipsets globally.

Palkhiwala also pointed out that 75 per cent of the Galaxy S22 models on the market were powered by Snapdragon chips.

Qualcomm’s President and CEO Cristiano Amon backed Palkhiwala saying that future flagship Galaxy phones worldwide will use Snapdragon chips.

“In handsets we entered into a new multiyear agreement with Samsung expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premium Samsung Galaxy products globally"" Amon was quoted as saying.

Samsung and Qualcomm have signed a multiyear agreement that calls for Snapdragon chipsets to be used in upcoming Galaxy flagship models according to the report.

An unlocked US version of the Galaxy S23+ running on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor appeared on Geekbench shortly after Qualcomm announced its partnership with Samsung.

As per the benchmarking results the phone packs at least 8 GB of RAM and runs on Android 13 reports Android Central.

Segal who died on Nov. 4 at age 89 didn’t quite come from rags but his ability to turn them into riches became legendary.

Peerless Clothing Inc. under his stewardship grew into one of the largest suppliers of high-end men’s suits in North America holding the license for such labels as Ralph Lauren Calvin Klein and Michael Kors.

Segal was also a leading spokesman for the Canadian apparel manufacturing industry helping shape government policy.

His wealth allowed him to become an outstanding philanthropist. His family’s $24-million donation in 2005 to the Jewish General Hospital for the creation of the Segal Cancer Centre was one of the largest of its kind at the time.

But he will probably be best remembered for his rescue of the Saidye Bronfman Centre—now the Segal Centre for Performing Arts—a couple of years later motivated largely by Segal’s infatuation with Yiddish theatre.

Segal has been called a visionary entrepreneur and one of the most knowledgeable people in employing technology to produce fine apparel. Segal’s foresight served him and the struggling garment industry in Canada most spectacularly in his recognizing what a boost free trade with the United States would be opening up a market 10 times the size of that in Canada.

Segal was named a member of the Order of Canada in 2002 (promoted to officer in 2010) for his “pivotal role” in advising Ottawa during the negotiations that led to the 1989 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and later the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A native of Albany N.Y. 18-year-old Segal realized he was not university bound and came to Montreal in 1951 to work in his stepfather’s clothing factory. He started at the bottom toiling on the floor.

Even after he rose to chairman and chief executive officer of Peerless Segal never lost his sweet unassuming persona—at least outside business. Within he was known as one tough customer.

Numerous condolences speak of his kindness constant smile and loyalty as a friend. According to his family his motto was: “Don’t look back you’ll only get a crick in your neck.”

In his 2017 memoir My Peerless Story: It Starts with the Collar Segal recounts how he transformed a small family business from “the collar down and from the ground up” relying heavily on intuition. Improving fabrics and modernizing machinery to make the “engineered suit” led to Peerless becoming the main source of designer labels for major department stores.

When the FTA came into effect Segal seized the opportunity to enter the American market and eventually almost all of his company’s clothes were exported to the U.S.

Segal became president of the Canadian Men’s Clothing Manufacturers Association.

Following a company tradition Segal said he donated his first paycheck at Peerless to Combined Jewish Appeal and “I haven’t looked back since” when it came to charitable giving.

The Jewish community Israel and Montreal in general have been beneficiaries of the Alvin Segal Family Foundation especially in the arts health care and education. It has made large donations to McGill University Health Centre Concordia and McGill Universities (notably to its Jewish teacher training program) Centraide of Greater Montreal the Jewish Public Library and the Governor General’s Performing Arts Awards.

He was chairman of the Segal Centre for Performing Arts board for many years playing a hands-on role in its welfare and creating an endowment for it.

Besides the Order of Canada Segal was inducted into the National Order of Quebec and named a Great Montrealer.

In a statement the Segal administration said that thanks to his support the centre has “thrived and become a leading player in the development of Canadian theatre. Simply put we would not be here without him…”

“Nothing brought him more joy than the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre. He would show up with danish pastries and pizza in hand for our volunteers and took pride in the personal recordings of the productions” said Segal executive and artistic director Lisa Rubin.

Segal once said “Art brings people together and is a positive force in society. My passion is to make this a cultural centre like you’ve never seen in Montreal.”

Friend Arthur Roskies said “My one outstanding memory of him was sitting beside him at a play at the Segal Centre and he was mouthing and virtually anticipating by a second what the actors were about to say on the stage. He confided to me that it was the sixth time he had seen the play and that he sees all the productions more than once. It showed me how dedicated he was to his centre—it was his baby.”

“Together with the board of directors we mourn the passing of a visionary who personified the importance of philanthropy for the arts in paving the way for the timely art institution that the Segal Centre is today. We are honoured to carry on his work and legacy” stated board president Sylvi Plante.

Segal is survived by his wife Emmelle his children Joel Barbara and Renee and their families.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdHdpbmZpbml0ZS5uZXQvZ3VpZGVzL2hvdy10by1nZXQtcG9sby1yYWxwaC1sYXVyZW4tY29zbWV0aWNzLWluLWZvcnRuaXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get Polo Ralph Lauren Cosmetics in Fortnite,"If you’re looking to really upgrade your style in Fortnite a new collaboration certainly has your back.

GPD is finally preparing to launch the Win 4 a gaming handheld that it began teasing in mid-September. Subsequently the company revealed numerous details about the Win 4 and compared it several times to the Steam Deck. Setting that comparison aside the GPD Win 4 features the AMD Ryzen 7 6800U and Radeon 680M iGPU which it complements with 16 GB or 32 GB of LPDDR5-6400 RAM.

Additionally the Win 4 has a 6-inch display that operates at 1920 x 1080 pixels and which slides up to reveal a small backlit keyboard. Moreover the gaming handheld has a 45.62 Wh battery 1 TB or 2 TB of PCIe 4.0 storage.

Whether you're a dyed-in-the-wool Radeon fanboy or just a general PC gamer you've got to be looking ahead with some excitement to the release of AMD's Radeon RX 7900 series graphics cards in mid-December. AMD's presentation left us with some questions but Frank Azor AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions & Marketing took some time to speak with us as well as a few other outlets and answered many of those questions.

One of the first big questions was ""where were the comparisons against NVIDIA?"" AMD is normally not shy about comparing its new products to its competitors where both NVIDIA and Intel typically prefer to compare against their own previous-generation products. We could write reams about why this is but apparently the reason AMD didn't compare itself to NVIDIA this time around is because the GeForce RTX 4080 isn't out yet and that's the card that the red team was targeting with its product.





Speaking to PC World and responding to a question from the livestream audience  Frank Azor also noted that AMD's FSR3 frame-generation technology is ""not a reaction ... to DLSS3"" and that the company has been working on it for ""a while."" He says it's not ready for prime time yet because AMD wants to make FSR 3 continue the tradition of openness that has carried through FidelityFX Super Resolution. In other words he wants to make it available on older and competitor GPUs not just on RDNA 3 Radeons.





Of course boost clocks will be higher than the nominal clocks and AMD isn't disclosing ""max boost"" numbers instead preferring to give ""game clocks"" that it thinks will more accurately represent what gamers will see while gaming. According to Jarred Walton for Tom's Hardware the maximum boost could be quite a bit higher than that. Speaking on a livestream  Walton stated that AMD told him the GPU was ""designed ... to scale to up to 3GHz."" Whether this means that the standard Radeon RX 7900 XTX will hit 3GHz or instead that partner cards with higher power limits can hit 3 GHz—or whether Walton misinterpreted something—we don't know.









That makes some sense given the $900 and $1000 price points for the Navi 31-based GPUs. NVIDIA's preliminary pricing on the GeForce RTX 4080 16GB model—which is now the only 4080 model —puts it at $1200 so if AMD's product is competitive it will certainly have a place in the market. However AMD could have compared its GPU against NVIDIA's previous-generation parts which are still technically current-generation below the GeForce RTX 4090—especially if the claims of drastically-improved ray-tracing performance are to be believed.Many details about RDNA 3 were leaked before the launch of the cards and most of those details were accurate but one area where leakers really scored a miss is on the topic of clock rates. Rumors had pegged RDNA 3 GPUs at easily over 3GHz and in some cases as high as 4GHz . Meanwhile the actual cards that AMD is selling top out at 2.5 GHz at least for their nominal clock rates.We should have the usual reviews of the new Radeons ready for you as soon as possible so sit tight and keep your eyes on HotHardware to find out whether AMD's new boards are boom or bust for the red team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk2NTY4LWFtZC1hZG1pdHMtZG9lc250LWhhdmUtcnR4LTQwOTAtY29tcGV0aXRvci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD admits it doesn't have an RTX 4090 competitor,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.techspot.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/96568-amd-admits-doesnt-have-rtx-4090-competitor.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF11573D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk2NTY4LWFtZC1hZG1pdHMtZG9lc250LWhhdmUtcnR4LTQwOTAtY29tcGV0aXRvci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

A 78-year-old woman also was wounded in the encounter.

The Hays County sheriff's office said deputies initially had responded to the 1300 block of Trinity Hills Drive in the Belterra subdivision where a disturbance between a man and a wrecker truck driver was reported.

""A short time later deputies responded to the 100 block of Victoria Court for a follow-up investigation related to the disturbance"" the sheriff's office said in a statement Saturday. That's when a man identified by the sheriff's office as 28-year-old John File came out of the residence on Victoria Court which is also in Belterra and rushed at deputies with a knife authorities said.

One of the deputies fired several rounds and shot File. A 78-year-old woman at the residence was shot in the arm according to the sheriff's office. Authorities did not say how she was related to File.

Both File and the woman were taken to the hospital where File was pronounced dead at 1:58 a.m. The woman was being treated for her injuries authorities said.

The Texas Rangers are assisting in the shooting investigation which is standard policy when a deputy has used lethal force according to the sheriff's office.

Serum levels of the disease-causing TTR protein were reduced by at least 90% at day 28 with a single infusion of NTLA-2001 at two different doses with reductions sustained across 4 to 6 months' follow-up.

NTLA-2001 was generally well-tolerated and the results were similar in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-III heart failure.

""These data further support and extend the early findings demonstrating the promise of CRISPR-based in vivo genome editing in humans"" said Julian Gillmore MBBS MD PhD who is leading the study at University College London.

""More specifically the deep TTR reductions observed in patients with ATTR amyloidosis in this study provide a real possibility of genuine clinical improvement in a condition that has hitherto been ultimately progressive and invariably fatal"" he said.

The results were reported in a late-breaking session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2022.

Mutations in the TTR gene and age-related changes in the stability of the TTR protein can cause misfolding of the TTR protein resulting in amyloid deposits in skin and myocardial tissues.

An estimated 50000 people worldwide are thought to have hereditary ATTR and up to 500000 to have wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. Amyloid cardiomyopathy is underdiagnosed and fatal in 3 to 10 years without treatment. Current treatment options only slow progression and require lifelong administration he said.

Results reported last year from the polyneuropathy arm of the study were hailed as a breakthrough and further proof-of-concept that CRISPR could be used to treat other diseases.

CRISPR gene editing has shown success for example in β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease but involved stem cells extracted from patients' bone marrow edited in the lab and then replaced.

NTLA-2001 (Intellia Therapeutics/Regeneron) is an in vivo treatment that uses lipid nanoparticles containing messenger RNA for Cas9 and a single-guide RNA targeting TTR in the liver where it's almost exclusively produced.

The new analysis included 12 patients with heart failure: 3 in NYHA class I-II and 6 in NYHA class III who received a single dose of NTLA-2001 at 0.7 mg/kg while the remaining 3 patients in NYHA class I-II received a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg.

During follow-up out to 6 months TTR reductions averaged:

93% in the 0.7 mg/kg NYHA I-II group at 6 months

94% in the 0.7 mg/kg NYHA III group at 4 months

92% in the 1.0 mg/kg NYHA I-II group at 4 months.

Eight patients reported mild or moderate adverse events and 2 patients experienced transient infusion reactions including one grade 3 reaction in the 0.7 mg/kg NYHA class III group that resolved without clinical consequence. This group was expanded to 6 patients per study protocol. No additional treatment-related adverse events higher than grade 1 were reported and no further dose escalation was undertaken Gillmore reported.

There were no clinically relevant laboratory findings; 1 patient had a transient grade 1 liver enzyme elevation.

One disadvantage of CRISPR is the potential for off-target effects but Gillmore said in an interview that the drug developers went through a ""very rigorous process when selecting the guide RNA which is what really targets the specificity of the TTR gene.""

""That's a really really important point"" he said. ""When they did various studies using for example primary human hepatocytes they found no evidence of off-target editing at concentrations of NTLA-2001 threefold greater than the EC 90  the concentration at which one knocks down the protein by 90%. So what we can say at the moment is the specificity of NTLA-2001 for the TTR gene seems to be absolute.""

In terms of other challenges going forward Gillmore added ""I think that it's really to see whether the knockdown that is being achieved is going to translate into greater clinical benefit.""

Invited discussant Kevin M. Alexander MD Stanford University in California said therapies that stabilize or reduce TTR have recently emerged that have improved ATTR amyloidosis outcomes including tafamidis and patisiran.

Nevertheless there has been an unmet need to develop therapies that can halt or reverse disease are effective in advanced ATTR and have an improved route or frequency of administration given that this is a chronic disease he said.

Alexander noted that the reductions of greater than 90% were achieved with higher doses than used in the polyneuropathy arm reported last year but were well tolerated in patients that for the most part had wild-type ATTR (83%) and reflect the wild-type ATTR population in practice. ""The data support consideration for subsequent efficacy trials for this compound.""

Unanswered questions in ongoing ATTR trials are whether TTR reductions translate into improved clinical outcomes the long-term safety of TTR lowering and the efficacy of NTLA-2001 particularly in higher-risk patients such as those in NYHA class III and those with hereditary ATTR Alexander said.

During a media briefing earlier in the day invited discussant Kiran Musunuru MD University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia pointed out that in the recent APOLLO-B trial of patisiran patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy had an average 87% TTR reduction but need intravenous infusions every 3 weeks for the rest of their lives.

""In contrast gene editing is a one-and-done proposition"" he said. ""You receive a single treatment that turns off the TTR gene permanently and the effects are durable and likely last a lifetime.""

Musunuru noted that patients who received patisiran also had significantly and substantially better functional capacity and quality of life compared with those who received placebo. ""Based on today's results we can expect in future clinical trials for gene editing to have the same beneficial effects and possibly a mortality benefit as well.""

Today's study is also important because it is part of the first wave of putting CRISPR into the body for an array of diseases he commented.

""TTR gene editing stands out because it's the very first CRISPR trial to show unequivocal success — you see that with a greater than 90% reduction in TTR"" Musunuru said. ""So in my view that makes it a milestone for modern medicine.""

Dosing at 55 mg corresponding to a fixed 0.7 mg/kg dose is ongoing in the dose-expansion portion of the trial with enrollment across both arms expected to be completed by the end of 2022 Intellia Therapeutics reported.

The study was funded by Intellia Therapeutics and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Gillmore receives consultancy fees from Alnylam Ionis AstraZeneca Pfizer Intellia ATTRalus and Novo Nordisk and has received grant support from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals reports. Alexander reports serving on advisory boards for Almylam and Arbor Biotechnologies; has consulted for Eidos Ionis Novo Nordisk and Pfizer; and has received grants from AHA Alnylam Eidos and the National Institutes of Health.

In a clinical trial a single intravenous infusion of NTLA-2001 a novel gene-editing therapy based on CRISPR/Cas9 significantly reduced abnormal levels of the protein transthyretin in patients with ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy a progressive and fatal cause of heart failure.

Circulating TTR protein which accumulates in the heart and causes progressive cardiomyopathy was rapidly and profoundly reduced by more than 90% in all patients after 28 days.

The gene-editing therapy was generally well-tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild.

CHICAGO Nov. 5 2022 — A single IV infusion of NTLA-2001 a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy significantly reduced circulating transthyretin (TTR) protein levels in patients with ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy a progressive and fatal cause of heart failure according to late-breaking research presented today at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2022. The meeting held in person in Chicago and virtually Nov. 5-7 2022 is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.

Transthyretin is a protein that is produced by the liver and transports retinol also known as vitamin A and the thyroid hormone thyroxine in circulation through the body. Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is caused by accumulation of fibrils composed of misfolded transthyretin protein in organs including the heart. The fibrils disrupt normal organ function and lead to progressive organ failure.

“Despite the availability of TTR protein stabilizers as a treatment option for people with ATTR amyloidosis it remains a progressive and universally fatal disease” said lead study author Julian D. Gillmore M.D. Ph.D. a professor at the University College London Centre for Amyloidosis in the U.K. “Recently clinical trials investigating therapy with gene-silencing agents targeting mRNA have found that lowering TTR protein levels results in cardiac benefits.”

Researchers evaluated the safety tolerability and efficacy of NTLA-2001 which precisely knocks out the TTR gene in the liver of people with ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. A single IV dose of NTLA-2001 is designed to minimize production of the abnormal TTR proteins.

The study included 12 participants with ATTR amyloidosis and varying levels of heart failure requiring treatment. Patients received a single infusion of NTLA-2001. Levels of TTR protein concentration in the bloodstream were measured at the beginning of the study and also at periodic intervals - two four and six months - after the single intravenous NTLA-2001 dose.

The results found that circulating serum TTR proteins were rapidly and profoundly reduced by at least 90% in all patients 28 days after administration of a single intravenous dose of NTLA-2001. These benefits were sustained through to the last study visit conducted between four and six months after receiving the therapeutic infusion. In addition NTLA-2001 was generally well-tolerated (meaning that there was only one serious adverse event which resolved) and the majority of adverse events such as infusion-related reactions were mild.

The primary limitation to interpretation of this study is that it is an original Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy Gillmore said.

“This is the first-ever human trial of gene editing in vivo or in the body and our study proves that gene editing in the human body is possible and also safe in the short term. We were impressed by the significant and consistent reductions in patients’ serum TTR protein levels” Gillmore said. “These results indicate that IV NTLA-2001 is a potential new treatment option that may stop disease progression in patients with ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy or even bring about improvement. However further research is needed to establish long-term safety of NTLA-2001 and to continue to monitor and evaluate the potential effects of markedly reduced TTR levels on patients’ clinical outcomes.”

By Rick Pezzullo—

A trio of trustees in Tarrytown are running unopposed for new two-year terms on Nov. 8. Robert Hoyt Thomas Mitchell and Paul Rinaldi will all be on the ballot on Election Day.

resident will be serving a ninth term on the seven-member board.

“I would like to continue to keep Tarrytown a place where residents can enjoy its beautiful natural resources that Tarrytown has to offer the Tarrytown Lakes and the Hudson River Waterfront” Hoyt said. “Additionally to enjoy and participate in all the beautiful walking trails and recreational facilities. One of my major concerns in keeping Tarrytown a beautiful Tree City USA Village and its walkability transit-minded community is the importance not to over develop our precious Village.”

“Traffic continues to be a problem on our already strained roadways and we must continue to monitor that as we move forward before considering any possible development in the future” Hoyt added. “I am always very mindful on how the village controls its budget. I would like all families to be able to afford to stay in this wonderful village and all it has to offer.”

Rinaldi a Clinical Psychologist with a specialty in addiction will be serving his third term. He has

lived in Tarrytown for 23 years and previously served on the Village Ethics Committee for more than a

decade. He could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile Mitchell who was appointed last year by Mayor Karen Brown to fill a vacancy after she was elected will be serving his first full term.

Mitchell served on the village’s Comprehensive Plan Management Committee and until recently was Chief Operating Officer of a private multilingual independent school in Manhattan.

“It has been a pleasure to work with the other trustees staff and volunteers who make Tarrytown the very special place that it is” Mitchell said. “I will continue to serve the people of Tarrytown and always aim to make Tarrytown a great place to live visit dine enjoy and foremost to be a safe and affordable village.”

During his time on the board Mitchell cited some accomplishments the board achieved including: saving the village more than $200000 a year on debt refinancing; keeping the village’s tax rate low; reviewing and providing solutions to decrease the damage forecasted from rising tidal impacts on Tarrytown waterfront; approving cannabis dispensaries; and working with New York State and the village’s CPMC.

“We received a grant for a new “map app” to help direct people to have key landmarks attractions parking and places of interest around the village. Once completed it will be a useful navigation tool for villagers people who work in Tarrytown and tourists” Mitchell said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3VrLXJlc2VhcmNoZXJzLWN1cmUtbWFuLXdoby1oYWQtY292aWQtZm9yLTQxMS1kYXlzLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK researchers cure man who had COVID for 411 days,"CNA – British researchers announced yesterday that they cured a man who was continually infected with COVID-19 for 411 days by analysing the genetic code of his particular virus to find the right treatment.

Persistent COVID-19 infection – which is different to long COVID or repeated bouts of the disease – occurs in a small number of patients with already weakened immune systems.

These patients can test positive for months or even years with the infection “rumbling along the whole time” said physician Dr Luke Snell who specialises in infectious diseases at Guy’s and St Thomas’ National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust.

The infections can pose a serious threat because around half of patients also have persistent symptoms such as lung inflammation Dr Snell told AFP adding that much remains unknown about the condition.

In a new study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases a team of researchers at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London describe how a 59-year-old man finally overcame his infection after over 13 months.

The man who has a weakened immune system due to a kidney transplant caught COVID-19 in December 2020 and continued to test positive until January 2022.

To discover whether he had contracted COVID-19 numerous times or if it was one persistent infection the researchers used a rapid genetic analysis with nanopore sequencing technology.

The test which can deliver results in as little as 24 hours showed the man had an early B.1 variant which was dominant in late 2020 but has since been replaced by newer strains.

Because he had this early variant the researchers gave him a combination of the casirivimab and imdevimab monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron. Like most other antibody treatments the treatment is no longer widely used because it is ineffective against newer variants such as Omicron.

But it successfully cured the man because he was battling a variant from an earlier phase of the pandemic. “The very new variants that are increasing in prevalence now are resistant to all the antibodies available in the United Kingdom (UK) the European Union (EU) and now even the United States (US)” Dr Snell said.

The team crushed up two antiviral treatments not previously used together – Paxlovid and Remdesivir – and administered them to the unconscious patient via a nasal tube according to a non-peer-reviewed pre-print study on the website ResearchSquare.

“Miraculously he cleared and perhaps this is now the avenue for how we treat these very difficult persistent infections” Dr Snell said emphasising that this treatment may not translate for normal COVID-19 cases."

Cement companies are planning to hike the price between Rs 10 and Rs 30 per bag in November after a increase of about Rs 3-4/bag last month said Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.

Emkay Global in a recent sectoral report said the average pan-India cement price increase was about Rs.3-4/bag in October 2022.

On a month-on-month (MoM) basis prices rose by 2-3 per cent in the East and South and about one per cent in the West; while declining 1-2 per cent in the northern and central regions the report said.

""Cement companies are attempting price hikes of Rs10-30/bag across regions in November 22. Absorption of these price hikes will be uncovered over the next few days"" said Emkay Global.

Industry volumes likely to have declined by a high single-digit YoY and a low double-digit MoM in October 22 owing to a high base as the festive season was spread across October-November last year.

According to the report a delayed exit of monsoons and labour shortage owing to festive holidays impacted demand in October 22.

The demand is expected to improve in upcoming weeks with all major festivals ending and given the onset of a busy construction season.

The cost pressure is expected to ease in coming quarters for the industry players and the industry margins are expected to bottom out in Q2 with peaking of costs higher exit of cement prices and pick-up in construction activities in coming quarters said Emkay Global.

The international petcoke prices are down by about 30 per cent from the peak of $195/tonne. Further the dip in the fuel prices are expected to provide cost savings of at least Rs 150-200/tonne from Q3FY23 Emkay Global said.

Rocha mainly backed by teachers other unions

By Tamara L Seward & Allen D. Payton

In the race for Antioch School Board Area 5 Trustee Mary Rocha leads in fundraising with $19159 in contributions over challenger Dominique King whose reports show a total of $11095.02 raised including loans from herself of $2759. Those figures are according to their Form 460’s as of close of reporting on Oct. 22 and Form 497 late contribution reports as of Nov. 2. King raised most of her funds inside Antioch. While Rocha spent almost twice as much as King during the reporting period the challenger shopped local with most of her expenditures made inside the city.

While individuals and other political committees can contribute a maximum of $4900 political action committees can contribute more. Campaigns must report the details for any amount of $100 more in contributions or expenditures.

Rocha Mainly Backed by Teachers Other Unions

For her re-election campaign Rocha started with $119.74 from her previous run in 2018 which gave her a total of $19278.74 to spend. MRocha ASB 2018 460 0701-092422 MRocha ASB 2022 460 0925-102222 MRocha ASB 2022 497 102622 MRocha ASB 2022 497 110222

Several unions contributed to Rocha’s campaign with $6000 from the Antioch Education Association Political Action Committee the local teacher’s union PAC $4900 from Dignity CA SEIU Local 2015 $1500 from the I.B.E.W Local Union 302 $1000 each from Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association Local #104 Political Action Committee and the Operating Engineers Local Union #3 Alameda Ca. Code: OTH and $500 each from the Laborers International Union of North America Local #324-AFL-CIO and Plumbing Industry Consumer Protection Fund United Association Local #159.

Rocha’s latest Form 460 report includes two mistakes showing the $1500 from I.B.E.W. listed three times resulting in an overstatement of her contributions received by $3000. Her grandson Ruben Rocha serves as her treasurer and son Louie is assisting on her campaign. Louie said Ruben corrected the report as of Sunday evening Nov. 6.

In addition the incumbent received $1000 each from LE03-Awin Management Inc. of Phoenix Arizona which is a subsidiary of Republic Services the garbage company that serves Antioch.

Her only reportable individual contributions from outside Antioch totaling $1100 were $1000 from former Antioch Police Chief Allan Cantando of Brentwood and $100 from Deputy D.A. Mary Knox of Walnut Creek.

Rocha received $425 in contributions of $100 or more from Antioch sources including $325 from her son Louie and $100 from former Antioch Councilman Ralph Hernandez. The incumbent also received a total of $1134.00 in contributions of less than $100.

Rocha’s expenditures which total $11471.91 were mostly spent outside of Antioch. They include $5625 to Mesa Outdoor of Danville for Highway 4 digital billboard ads $4521.92 paid to JB Services of Martinez for mailers and $485.34 to My Legacy Matters Inc. of Vallejo for lawn signs.

She only spent $615 inside Antioch with $500 paid to the Antioch Historical Society for a fundraising event and $115 to the Antioch Herald for advertising.

Rocha’s latest Form 460 report shows an ending cash balance of $4906.83 which was overstated by $3000 and she had an outstanding debt of $1875 owed to Mesa Outdoor. With the additional $5900 in additional contributions reported on two Form 497’s on Oct. 26 and Nov. 2 that leaves her with $5931.82 to spend during the final week of the campaign.

King Mainly Backed by Thorpe Antioch Residents

King raised $8336.02 in contributions with over half from Mayor Lamar Thorpe and the majority from three Antioch politicians. The mayor contributed the maximum of $4900 from his Stop the #Karen Recall of Mayor Thorpe 2022 campaign committee.

King received the majority of her individual contributions of over $100 from Antioch totaling $1778.79. They include $515.88 from Daniel Hernandez $309.43 from Beatriz Hernandez $300 from David Asfall $250 from Antioch School Board Area 1 Trustee Antonio Hernandez and $100 each from four individuals including District 1 Antioch City Councilwoman Tamisha Torres-Walker.

Her individual contributions of over $100 from outside of Antioch totaled $1203.48. The largest was $500 received from political campaign consultant Melody Weintraub of Lafayette followed by $300 from Larhonda Crosby-Johnson of San Leandro plus $303.48 from three individuals in Pittsburg Berkeley and Vallejo.

She also received a total of $353.75 in contributions of less than $100.

King had only spent $5099.27 as of Oct. 22. She shopped local with the majority of her expenditures over $100 inside Antioch totaling $3024.13. They include $819.29 at La Plazuela restaurant for a fundraiser $795.95 with Crystal Clear Logos $756.79 with FastSigns and $506 paid to Vincent Cecilio for professional services.

The challenger also spent a total of $1874 outside of Antioch including $1059 at Copyworld Inc. in Berkeley and $715 on slate mailers.

King ended the period with $5995.75 cash on hand and $2759 in outstanding debt for the loans giving her campaign a net $3236.75 left to spend during the remainder of the campaign unless she doesn’t repay herself. If not whatever amount King doesn’t repay becomes a contribution.

The election is Tuesday.

Lewandowski blasted his seventh-minute spot-kick against the upright during a frustrating first half at the Nou Camp.

Pique playing his final game for the club forced goalkeeper Fernando Martinez into an early second-half save but Ousmane Dembele’s 48th-minute strike finally broke the deadlock.

Frenkie de Jong doubled the lead 14 minutes later to ensure the Catalan giants top LaLiga at least until Monday’s clash between Rayo Vellacano and Real Madrid.

Javi Sanchez and Roque Mesa scored either side of half-time as Real Vallodolid beat Elche 2-1 with Josan replying for the visitors.

Chimy Avila’s first-half double was enough to secure a 2-1 win for Osasuna at Celta Vigo despite Iago Aspas’ equaliser.

Getafe’s Gaston Alvarez and Portu and Cadiz’s Luis Hernandez were all sent off and the home side’s Enes Unal hit the post in stoppage time as a 0-0 draw came to a dramatic conclusion at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez.

Eric Choupo-Moting scored twice in as many minutes to edge Bayern Munich to the top of the Bundesliga table after a five-goal thriller at Hertha Berlin.

Choupo-Moting struck in the 37th and 38th minutes after Jamal Musiala had given the visitors the lead but Dodi Lukebakio’s finish and Davie Selke’s penalty dragged Hertha back into it before the break although they could not prevent Bayern from claiming an eighth successive win in all competitions.

Borussia Dortmund are just three points worse off in third after a 3-0 home win over Bochum.

Again all the goals came in the first half with Youssoufa Moukoko finding the back of the net twice either side of Giovanni Reyna’s 12th-minute penalty.

Half-time substitute Ansgar Knauff was Eintracht Frankfurt’s match-winner as they came from behind at Augsburg to win 2-1.

Mergim Berisha’s first-minute opener got the home side off to the perfect start but Sebastian Rode levelled before the break to set up Knauff to claim the points after it.

Christopher Nkunku scored twice in RB Leipzig’s 3-1 win at Hoffenheim while Patrick Wimmer Maximilian Arnold and Ridle Baku were on target for Wolfsburg in a 3-0 victory at Mainz.

Goals from Niclas Fullkrug and Marvin Ducksch eased Werder Bremen to a 2-1 win over bottom-of-the-table Schalke who scored a minute from time through substitute Dominick Drexler.

Serie A leaders Napoli had to come from behind at second-placed Atalanta to establish a six-point gap at the top of the pile.

Ademola Lookman had fired the home side ahead with a 16th-minute penalty after Victor Osimhen was deemed to have handled but the striker made amends within seven minutes when he headed the visitors level before setting up Eljif Elmas to win it.

Olivier Giroud scored a dramatic late winner and was sent off for his celebration as AC Milan edged past Spezia 2-1 to go second.

Giroud picked up a second yellow card for removing his shirt while celebrating his 89th-minute decider after Daniel Maldini had dragged the visitors back into it following Theo Hernandez’s 21st-minute goal.

Substitute Daniel Ciofani snatched a point for struggling Cremonese at Salernitana as they fought back twice to draw 2-2.

David Okereke had earlier cancelled out Krzysztof Piatek’s opener and Lassana Coulibaly’s finish proved insufficient to claim victory as Ciofani struck seconds after missing a penalty.

Tommaso Baldanzi handed Empoli a 1-0 win over Sassuolo.

In France goals from Wesley Said and Facundo Medina wrapped up the points despite Miha Blazic’s late header as Lens cemented second place in Ligue 1 with a 2-1 victory over basement club Angers.

Ten-man Ajaccio staged a remarkable fightback to beat Strasbourg 4-2.

Trailing to early goals from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Kevin Gameiro they responded in fine style through Mounaim El Idrissy Youcef Belaili’s double from the spot and Riad Nouri before half-time and managed to hang on despite Clement Vidal’s 79th-minute dismissal.",,,,,,,,,

“I can think of no one better to be the Godmother of this incredible ship than the G.O.A.T. herself – Simone Biles” said Jason Liberty President and CEO of the Royal Caribbean Group the parent company of Celebrity Cruises.

“This ship’s beauty power and resilience sets the standard by which all others will be measured. Simone’s determination progressive nature empowered attitude and grace in the face of challenges make her such an inspiration to so many around the world. All of these attributes are why Simone Biles is perfectly suited to watch over Celebrity Beyond’s journey” he added.

“I’ve been waiting for this day to arrive for a long time and I am ‘Beyond’ excited to be able to share her with our guests. She is the gold standard by which other ships are built and embodies the meaning of relaxed luxury” said Lisa Lutoff-Perlo Celebrity Cruises President and CEO.

“She is ‘FULL’ of wonder and excitement and our guests will undoubtedly feel reconnected to the world around them as they visit new destinations and immerse themselves in culinary experiences and wellness amenities not found anywhere else at sea.”

Alongside Liberty Lutoff-Perlo and other Celebrity Cruises executives Simone Biles officially named Celebrity Beyond in a ceremony attended by 2500 guests and media capped by a live performance from singer and songwriter Leona Lewis.

“It is an honor to be selected as Beyond’s Godmother and to join such a distinguished group of strong barrier-breaking women who have been named as Celebrity’s Godmothers before me” said Simone Biles.

“I appreciate the important message this designation holds in recognizing our accomplishments as empowering women and I am honored to share the stage today with fellow brave boundary-breaking leaders like Lisa-Lutoff Perlo and Captain Kate McCue” she added.

According to Celebrity the arrival to the U.S. of the Celebrity Beyond ushers a “new era of cruising” coming on the heels of a new brand campaign that aims to “define what a relaxed luxury resort at sea is.”

Simone Biles teams up with Celebrity Cruise

Biles joined a list of celebrities including Reshma Saujani of Girls Who Code and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai who named the company’s earlier ships. Saujani was dubbed godmother to Celebrity Apex while Yousafzai named Celebrity Edge.

Celebrity Cruise officials on Friday said that the most decorated gymnast of all time was the deserving candidate to join the list of empowered women. Jason Liberty CEO of the Royal Caribbean Group Celebrity's parent company said:

""I can think of no one better to be the godmother of this incredible ship than the G.O.A.T. herself - Simone Biles.”

Simone Biles expressed her joy at being named the godmother of a cruise ship. The athlete pointed out that she appreciated the recognition as an empowering woman. She also hailed Capt. Kate McCue the first American female cruise ship captain. Biles said:

""It is an honor to be selected as Beyond's godmother and to join such a distinguished group of strong barrier-breaking women who have been named as Celebrity's godmothers before me. I appreciate the important message this designation holds in recognizing our accomplishments as empowering women and I am honored to share the stage today with fellow brave boundary-breaking leaders like Lisa-Lutoff Perlo and Capt. Kate McCue.""

Earlier in May Biles released a statement claiming that she was honored to get the designation from the cruise company.

Simone Biles said:

""I have a lot of great memories of cruising with my parents while growing up so I am beyond excited to serve as godmother of Celebrity Beyond… I am honored to join such a distinguished group of game-changing women and appreciate the important message this designation holds in recognizing our accomplishments and hopefully inspiring the next generation of women.""

Simone Biles received the Presidential Medal of Freedom

She recently became the youngest recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The highest US civilian honor was conferred to her at a ceremony on July 7. While giving her the award Joe Biden commended her for a successful athletic career and for using her platform to advocate for better mental health and for speaking out against sexual harassment.

For context Biles withdrew from the finals of the 2020 Summer Olympics citing deteriorating mental health. The gymnast’s move started a global conversation around the need to focus on better mental health for athletes.

Announcing her decision to pull out of the competition Bile said:

""I say put mental health first. Because if you don't then you're not going to enjoy your sport and you're not going to succeed as much as you want to. So it's OK sometimes to even sit out the big competitions to focus on yourself because it shows how strong of a competitor and person that you really are — rather than just battle through it.""

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2phY2tzb24tcmVlZC1sYXdzdWl0LWlzcmFlbC1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1zZXR0bGVtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,D.C.'s largest high school to show alternate Palestinian film after suit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2phY2tzb24tcmVlZC1sYXdzdWl0LWlzcmFlbC1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1zZXR0bGVtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF15F7FA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2phY2tzb24tcmVlZC1sYXdzdWl0LWlzcmFlbC1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1zZXR0bGVtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbGJlcnRzb25mdW5lcmFsaG9tZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wZXRlci1sYXR1cm51c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter S.

The retired teacher who lives in Oberlin continued those classes for several months and this fall had 10 of her pieces displayed in the Beth K. Stocker Art Gallery 1005 N. Abbe Road in Elyria.

Dakos’ art was part of the REFRESH exhibit that showcased the work of several Center for Lifelong Learning art students and instructors.

One of her watercolor paintings – her favorite of a blue heron – sold at the exhibit’s opening night.

“My daughters are thrilled that I’ve continued taking classes” Dakos says. “And it was incredible to be exhibited as an artist in the gallery.”

Another student artist featured in the gallery was Cheryl Burkhardt of Lorain.

Also a retired educator Burkhardt has been taking classes ranging from art to tai chi at LCCC for years.

Doing so has helped her remain social which she says contributes to a healthy lifestyle after retirement.

“It’s just as important as exercise and eating well” Burkhardt says. “The Center for Lifelong Learning at the college is a really special program that lets us take part in something and enhance our lives.”

“Within the classes I’ve taken it almost becomes a family” Dakos says. “We bring in vegetables that are extra at home and share different kinds of desserts. It’s just fun.”

Burkhardt who also sold a painting at the gallery opening says art has always been an interest of hers although she never made it into a career.

Instead Burkhardt followed her passion for education – one that is clearly still alive today – to LCCC’s campus where she earned her bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Ashland University in the mid-1980s.

Burkhardt attended the earliest iteration of today’s University Partnership.

“Ashland University had just opened a branch here and I thought I’m going to give that a try” she says. “And that is truly what I was meant to be – a teacher.”

Both Burkhardt and Dakos say the positive impact art has had on the students they taught for decades has done the same for them in retirement.

“What excited me most about teaching is the fact that your brain is constantly being active” Burkhardt says.

“And art does that too” Dakos adds. “It just pulls on a different part of the brain and that helps keep it sharp.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMDYvd29vZGxhbmQtbmVpZ2hib3JzLWNvbWUtdG9nZXRoZXItdG8tcmVub3ZhdGUtYmxpbmQtd29tYW5zLWhvbWUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlkZW1vY3JhdC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wNi93b29kbGFuZC1uZWlnaGJvcnMtY29tZS10b2dldGhlci10by1yZW5vdmF0ZS1ibGluZC13b21hbnMtaG9tZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodland neighbors come together to renovate blind woman’s home,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dailydemocrat.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/11/06/woodland-neighbors-come-together-to-renovate-blind-womans-home/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCEFED4940>, 'Connection to www.dailydemocrat.com timed out.

Foster College on Thursday.

Michael Grant said the book “might be the best book ever written on Jamaica’s athletics because a lot of it reads like a spy novel some of it reads like an adventure story some of it reads like a romance (and) some of it reads like a thriller. It’s the kind of thing you kind of can’t put down because what we have done is to allow each of the races to have its own personality. Each of the races has its own life story and so far from just being a description from who won what when it goes beyond that to get into the heads of our athletes into the heads of our rivals administrators and a lot of people who are surrounding the races.”

Regarding the G.C. Foster documentary Finding Foster Grant said: “He was a lot better of a sprinter than I thought when I started the project because the information just wasn’t out there and I don’t think he boasted a lot about it when he was finished on the track so when we searched and realized that he won so much and beat so many big names it really made the project have a different color all together.

“We were looking at a genuine bona fide superstar the first one so he turned out to be a very assuming character but no less of a hero.”

He also said the research was extensive and covered many countries.

Lawrence spoke about some of the athletes in the book. “1991 Ottey gets gold in the 4×1 the woman who turned a sprinter to a marathon. That’s how they captured on the IAAF. So we have captured that and what it meant to Jamaica and Ottey. Deon Hemmings win in 1996. Those types of turning point moments are captured in the book so a new generation can pick it up and get excited about it.”

Hemmings-McCatty Jamaica’s first Olympics female gold medalist spoke about her 400m hurdles gold in 1996 “It’s a really good feeling. I had put in the work. I remember when I was in Texas training the group of athletes on the other end normally say to me why you always running around the track? And to know where I came from how hard I worked when I was in college before I got to college I was not one of the top junior athletes but I got in and I took advantage of the opportunity I worked hard and I was victorious and I am really happy that I put in the work and it paid off so if you work hard you can do well. I can attest to that.”

She spoke about the state of Jamaica’s track and field at this time “we are doing well. I think there’s a lot more work to be done but we are getting there and we are working on it and I am pretty proud of what’s going on so far.”

According to Gibbs Williams vice principal of G.C. Foster College “when Kingston Communications approached us to partner with them in launching the book 50 Days Afire (and premier Finding Foster) we felt obliged to accept we felt honored as a matter of fact. Remember G.C. Foster the man this institution was named after him and so we thought that it would be a win-win situation for us it would give the college the sort of mileage that we are looking for and also to bring this event to the home of athletics.” He also said he was pleased to host three of G.C. Foster’s granddaughters who attended the event.

The grandchildren Heather Chin Andre Roberts and Debbie Jardine were pleased with the reception and respect given to their grandfather.

“We are totally honored to be here very proud of our grandfather and feel honored to be his granddaughter” said Chin while Roberts said “I too am very proud of him and really feel honored to be his granddaughter and we are learning a lot from you people too.”

For Jardine “it is just really amazing to us that you guys have kept his legacy alive. It says a lot for the school that they have kept his name.”

A savvy photographer captured an unexpected last-minute entry into a surf contest: a great white shark terrifyingly close to a surfer.

Jordan Anast a California-based photographer was taking pictures of the San Onofre Surf Club Contest when he captured the shocking image of the shark seemingly just yards away from surfer Tyler Warren in the foreground.

Anast took the remarkable photo on October 22 at around 11 a.m. he told CNN. At first he didn’t realize exactly what he had captured. He had shot dolphins before “surfing in the water” and from afar the animal looked like it might be another dolphin he said.

“I didn’t know until I looked closely after and saw the structures of the fins” he explained. Then he “realized it was a great white shark.”

But he wasn’t alarmed by the discovery he said. “They’re always out there everywhere in California” he said.

He captured a total of six images of the great white shark breaching he said. He attributed the once-in-a-lifetime shot to a combination of luck and his 400 millimeter telephoto lens which he typically uses for photographing sporting events from afar.

The photo’s online popularity has been “crazy” he said. “Today’s been the craziest day ever. It doesn’t stop going. [The photo] has its own legs now.”

Great white sharks are found across America’s coasts though the exact population in US waters is unknown according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The sharks can be as long as 21 feet as adults and weigh more than 4000 pounds.

The sharks are listed as “vulnerable” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are protected internationally under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb29kLXN0YW1wcy1zY2hlZHVsZS1vaGlvLWRpcmVjdGlvbi0xMTMwMjA1NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food Stamps Schedule: Ohio Direction Card SNAP Payments for October 2022,"Milan_Jovic / iStock.com

As in most states Ohio residents who qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP) benefits receive their payments according to the same schedule every month including October. In Ohio the program is administered by the state’s Department of Jobs and Family Services (DJFS).

Food Stamps: States Extending SNAP Emergency Allotment Money Through October 2022

Inflation Relief Checks: When Will You Get Yours?

Benefits are deposited monthly into SNAP accounts linked to your Ohio Direction Card the state’s version of Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards. Cards can be used anywhere you see the Ohio Direction Card sticker such as most grocery stores certain other retail locations and participating farmers’ markets.

After making a purchase with your Ohio Direction Card a receipt will show your purchase amount and the amount of benefits you have left in the account. If you need to know your balance but don’t have your last receipt call the toll-free number (866-386-3071) on the back of your Direction Card. You can also access your information online at the ConnectEBT site.

SNAP formerly known as food stamps is a federal program that provides food-purchasing assistance to low-income households. Although it is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture the program is administered at the state level.

As previously reported by GOBankingRates the USDA’s cost-of-living adjustments for SNAP benefits will go into effect on Oct. 1 2022 providing an increase in food aid to Ohio families. For individuals the program’s maximum monthly food allotments will increase to $281 from $250. For couples it will increase to $516 from $459 and for four-person households it will increase to $939 from $835. The minimum monthly allotment will increase to $23 from $20 according to the DJFS.

SNAP recipients can use their Direction Cards to purchase certain food items:

Fruits and vegetables

Meat poultry and fish

Dairy products

Breads and cereals

Snack foods and non-alcoholic beverages

Seeds and plants which produce food for the household to eat.

Among the items you can’t buy with SNAP benefits are alcoholic beverages tobacco products vitamins medicines supplements live animals pet foods cleaning supplies paper products and cosmetics. In Ohio you also can’t use SNAP to purchase hot meals because it is not among the states that operate a Restaurant Meals Program through SNAP.

You can apply for SNAP benefits online at Benefits.Ohio.gov or submit an application to your county Department of Job and Family Services office. You can also file a SNAP application through your local Ohio Benefit Bank website.

Southwest Airlines/Screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk

Do you find yourself breathing a little more deeply these days?

The evenings are getting ever darker the pressure of work ever more intractable.

You need to be somewhere different. You need to experience different people different places and different smells.

You want in essence to get away.

Yet cheap convenient flights aren't so easy to find.

Airlines see no slackening of demand. Their executives are salivating at the image of packed flights and even the temptation of overbooking.

This will surely make passengers wonder as they desperately try to find a holiday flight -- and then the money to pay for it -- why isn't holiday flying quite what it used to be?

Helpfully Southwest Airlines decided to tell them.

Also: In-flight Wi-Fi is a nightmare but fixes could be on the way

Well not exactly tell passengers but tell the financial community why Southwest isn't making even more money than it already is.

As it presented its very fine third-quarter results -- record revenues a record number of passengers -- the airline's CEO offered a little nuance. Speaking to CNBC he mused in an if only kind of way that his airline wasn't able to offer say a record number of flights.

In the fourth quarter he said the airline is ""looking for up revenues again on even down capacity.""

I reached for my abacus and worked out that this might just mean flights will cost more. How else will the airline make more money from fewer seats?

When asked where the problem really lay Jordan was succinct: ""It's really pilots.""

Was he blaming the pilots -- who aren't so happy with Southwest currently -- for the lack of more capacity? Goodness no. He was blaming the lack of more pilots for the lack of more capacity.

Also: The best travel VPNs

""We are short of pilots to fly all our aircraft"" he said. ""Our classes are full we are getting pilots we're getting great pilots but our training centers are full.""

But how long might this situation last? ""We won't catch the aircraft until probably late 2023"" Jordan admitted. So this pilot shortage may not have been a pure pandemic thing but something that'll last rather longer?

What does that mean in terms of Southwest's capacity to offer seats to the desperate who just want to get away?

""If we had all the pilots we needed"" said Jordan ""We could probably fly 5 to 8% more ASMs (available seat miles).""

Perhaps you well up in sympathy. You realize that hiring has been difficult over the last year or two. And naturally I want to well up with you.

I merely have a single thought woodpeckering inside my head.

When the pandemic struck airlines begged for our money -- via the government that is. They received tens of billions in bailout funds.

One of their next steps was to offer buyouts to staff -- including what do you know pilots. It was clear that headcount was being reduced. Yet the bailout money was supposed to keep the band together. It was supposed to keep airlines fully staffed for the inevitable post-pandemic rush.

Also: Starlink RV review: Changes the game for digital nomads

You're experiencing that woodpeckering too aren't you? You're imagining that some of this bailout money may have gone to paying for staff buyouts.

Naturally I wouldn't dream of such cynical logic. However the House Oversight Committee recently asked the Treasury Department whether oh no airlines may have used your money to get rid of headcount. Including pilot headcount.

Oh you know that passengers can't do anything about all this. Equally passengers know how enraging cancellations -- and higher fares -- have been over the last long while.

I wonder how many people's plans will be altered specifically because Southwest can't increase its capacity by 5 to 8%.

I hope you've already made your holiday plans. And please look forward to next year. Maybe just maybe supply will meet demand.

Maybe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZ29vZ2xlLWZsaWdodHMtdHJhdmVsLWFycm93LWhhY2stMTc1NTg5ODAucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A simple travel hack for finding the cheapest airfare online,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/google-flights-travel-arrow-hack-17558980.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZ29vZ2xlLWZsaWdodHMtdHJhdmVsLWFycm93LWhhY2stMTc1NTg5ODAucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdW5pdGVkYWZhLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvNS93aGF0LXdhcy10aGUtYWlybGluZS1kZXJlZ3VsYXRpb24tYWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Was The Airline Deregulation Act?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='unitedafa.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/2022/11/5/what-was-the-airline-deregulation-act/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1D907F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdW5pdGVkYWZhLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvNS93aGF0LXdhcy10aGUtYWlybGluZS1kZXJlZ3VsYXRpb24tYWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Rachel used a vintage swing from the strongside pin going crosscourt to shallow five for kill No. 1568.Rachel finished with 10 kills 15 digs and four aces on her historic night.hit .357 with 13 kills and seven digs whileadded 10 kills on .421 hitting.enjoyed a terrific performance in the middle hitting .750 on 9-0-12 with four blocks.Emma Berran picked her spots well piling up 38 assists and directing the offense to hit .377 with 54 kills.rounded out the offense with seven kills on .500 hitting.anchored the defense with 15 digs while adding a pair of aces.Reflecting onrecord-breaking moment… ""That was a lot of fun. Marci and I were chatting on the bench and she said it's just pretty incredible. A young lady comes in and does this for four years helps turn a program around – with a lot of other good players as well – she's the model of consistency. Takes care of her body makes good decisions is a really great teammate just checks a lot of boxes. She's been really fun to coach and work with. She's very low maintenance. Sometimes you get players who are a little selfish out there but Linsey is just the opposite of that. She hardly ever asks for anything – just a fantastic athlete.""""The team we faced tonight just wasn't putting as much pace on the ball when they hit – it was a lot more offspeed stuff that was a bit of a challenge. We hadn't seen a lot of that stuff recently having played a stretch of Northern Duluth Concordia Southwest – so it was good for us to see some of that. Now we have to gear up for teams that are going to swing a little bit harder attack the block some more. I thought Mary did a good job of hitting around our blockers so it was a little different team out there that way.""""If we can put up numbers similar to this in the conference tournament we'll be very successful. If we hit .300 three matches in a row block a little bit and play some defense we can put ourselves in a position to be very successful. We have to be efficient we have to put good swings on the ball and limit errors – that was key for us tonight. If you make teams have to score 18 points a set at this level that becomes very difficult. We have to be a little cleaner make better decisions cover a little bit better so our hitters can attack the block but overall a pretty good job.""Looking ahead to the conference tournament… ""Some of is to just keep doing what we're doing. We're trending in the right direction – limiting errors decisions we're making keeping balls in play. We've had some hitters and servers who at times have made errors in bad spots – I thought we looked much better in that regard this weekend putting ourselves in better positions that way.""St. Cloud State will enter the 2022 NSIC Tournament as the No. 5 seed matching up with Southwest Minnesota State on Friday November 11 at 5:00 p.m. CT at the Ganglehoff Center in St. Paul.Information regarding single game and season tickets can be found at scsutickets.com.

The Mississippi Legislature approved a $246 million incentive package Wednesday for Steel Dynamics Inc. to build a state-of-the-art low-carbon aluminum flat-rolled mill near its Columbus steel mill on Airport Road and a biocarbon production facility on Artesia Road near the International Paper pulp mill. The company’s total capital investment will be $2.5 billion and the two facilities will create about 1000 jobs with an average annual salary of $93000.

Part of that incentive package is $25 million in state funds for improvements to Charleigh Ford Jr. Drive and Artesia Road as well as an $18 million loan from the state that Lowndes County will repay over 10 years after the plants are operating.

Golden Triangle Development LINK CEO Joe Max Higgins said Friday that $18 million will go toward land acquisition buying out farming contracts on some properties and “soft costs.”

Other than roadwork for which the county will use about $2.5 million of the state loan and power needs – which Higgins said the Tennessee Valley Authority has committed to provide – the infrastructure is already in place.

“Water is already around the site and sewer and wastewater treatment are sufficient to what they need” Higgins said.

The biocarbon plant is slated to begin construction this year and is expected to be complete by late 2023. The aluminum plant will begin construction some time next year with expected completion in 2025.

Procuring the land

The aluminum plant would occupy about 2100 acres west of Golden Triangle Regional Airport – with Charleigh Ford Jr. Drive bordering it to the west and Artesia Road to its south.

Almost 1100 of those acres are the Infinity Megasite which TVA certified in 2016 for industrial development. The Lowndes County Industrial Development Authority gifted another 305 acres to the project.

GTRA is swapping 144 acres of property intended for a cross runway Higgins said for a strip of roughly 236 acres immediately to the east that is contiguous with the airport and would allow for a future parallel runway. That swap is pending Federal Aviation Administration approval.

About 65 acres at the corner of Charleigh Ford and Artesia Roads is 16th Section land the county school district has agreed to swap for 84 acres of farmland on Motley Road southeast of the Mississippi Sheriffs’ Boys and Girls Ranch. County supervisors the Mississippi Development Authority and the Secretary of State’s office must all sign off on this exchange Higgins said.

The LINK has options to purchase privately held land for the balance of the planned aluminum plant site which Higgins said will be assigned to SDI to execute. He did not divulge the cost of the options or the agreed upon purchase price for those properties citing the owners’ request for privacy.

For the biocarbon plant LCIDA has gifted 130-plus acres at Artesia Road and Manufacturers Drive.

Building the roads

About 1.6 miles of the southern portion of Charleigh Ford Jr. Drive which is now gravel will be paved at an estimated cost of $4.5 million Higgins said. The remaining three miles of that road that runs north and east to Airport Road is already paved.

The largest road project estimated at $17.3 million is building a wider stronger roadway along 3.77 miles of Artesia Road – from Charleigh Ford to Manufacturers Drive. While already paved that stretch is only rated for 57000 towing pounds Higgins said. Once finished the project will bump that to 80000 pounds.

There also will be an addition to the west side of Manufacturers Drive that Higgins said will “separate” IP and the biocarbon plant and also allow delivery trucks and employees a way out around the nearby railroad tracks.

Future project

A third “future project” for SDI listed in the incentive package has not been specified but LCIDA has reserved the space for it to be developed.

The development authority has 300 acres immediately north of SDI’s steel mill from which SDI can choose 200 to develop for the future project. The company must close that deal and meet some other criteria by the end of 2024 to get that property for free.

“They have to also commit to investing $200 million to develop the site” Higgins said.

This is a 2U active heatsink.

Dynatron J10 for 2U AMD EPYC Genoa

The AMD EPYC Genoa is a new platform with an absolutely massive footprint. The Socket SP5 heatsinks like the Dynatron J10 and J12 are larger than previous generations. Just for some sense of scale here is the six screw (up from four on SP3) retention mechanism and the J10 next to a 13th Gen Intel Core a 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids and an AMD EPYC 7773X (“Milan-X”) processor:

Something we noted on the J12 review was the challenge we had with the Dynatron quality specifically the packaging quality that left the fan mounting brackets broken. The J10’s that we received were a different story. The pre-printed Shin-Etsu 7762 thermal paste looked like the printer or stencil was out of alignment. Both had thermal paste that looked off but this one was particularly not great looking.

The units themselves are 2U with five heatpipes. Dynatron says that this design has the same 320W TDP (we have seen other references saying these are 300W coolers) as the 3U J12 with fewer heatpipes less metal and a smaller fan. This unit is only 510g.

The fan here is also notable. It sits on the unit just like other older generations of 2U active heatsinks we have seen.

This 60mm fan unit at 100% duty cycle pushes about half the volume of air as the 3U 80mm one and is generally less efficient. That is why we were surprised to see both rated for 320W on Dynatron’s website.

Given the J12 weighs 56% more and has a more powerful fan we would assume that has more thermal headroom than the J10 but both are currently listed at 320W. The unit is actually quite similar to the older A38 for SP3 in many ways.

Final Words

Hopefully you enjoyed this quick weekend piece. The Dynatron J10 2U heatsink and fan combo comes from a lineage of Dynatron coolers that STH has used for many years. Still we purchased eight heatsinks and more than half of them had easily identifiable quality issues like the pre-printed thermal paste on these J10’s. Hopefully ours were anomalies and this is fixed later in production but seeing two slip through Dynatron quality control was not confidence-inspiring.

Stay tuned to STH as we will be able to bring you more on AMD EPYC Genoa come launch day.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Helium Mobile pairs the Helium 5G decentralized network with coverage from T-Mobile’s nationwide 5G network.

Decrypt’s Art Fashion and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Decentralized crypto-fueled wireless network Helium recently voted to move from its own platform to Solana a leading layer-1 blockchain network. Now that alliance is set to get even stronger with Helium and Solana bringing their respective mobile initiatives together.

At Solana’s Breakpoint conference in Lisbon today Helium and Solana Labs announced a partnership to bring the upcoming Helium Mobile service—a smartphone carrier powered in part by T-Mobile—to Solana’s crypto-centric Saga smartphone. Both are due to launch in early 2023.

The Android-powered Saga phone will come with a free 30-day trial for Helium Mobile in the United States offering unlimited voice and text use during that span. The Saga phone will not be exclusive to Helium Mobile however: a Helium representative clarified to Decrypt that Solana Labs’ smartphone can be used with other carriers instead.

Boris Renski GM of wireless at Nova Labs—the startup that represents the founders of and core contributors to the Helium network—told Decrypt that the partnership is a “natural fit.”

""Not only will this partnership ultimately drive usage to the Helium Network” he said “but Saga customers who sign up for Helium Mobile will be able to have a seamless and integrated user experience and could earn crypto rewards for using their cell service.”

Announced in September Helium Mobile is the first crypto-fueled wireless carrier created in partnership with major wireless service T-Mobile. Helium Mobile pulls its coverage both from the decentralized Helium 5G network—with users running their own 5G nodes to share coverage in exchange for crypto tokens—and T-Mobile’s nationwide 5G service.

Helium’s 5G network currently spans just over 6700 antennas deployed by individual users. It’s worth noting that Helium’s developers have clarified that while the network is capable of supporting 5G radios the early devices available on the market are limited to slower 4G LTE.

Nova Labs has said that Helium Mobile will offer plans as cheap as $5 per month. Furthermore users can opt into earning crypto tokens by sharing location data with the network as they’ll help Helium Mobile stabilize its coverage in the process.

Solana’s Saga smartphone was revealed in June and delivers high-end Android hardware at a price point of $1000.

In total the company is reducing its headcount by 14 per cent a move that will bring the company’s number of employees to 7000. The correspondence with staff came across as genuine and the Irish-born co-founders of Stripe appear to have gone to great lengths to provide additional financial and future support to those affected.

The brothers also explained the decision in detail outlying the many factors hurting Stripe – as well as a host of other major technology multinationals – at present.

Patrick Collison said the company “overhired” during the pandemic and was “too optimistic” about the near-term growth of e-commerce. When the pandemic arrived Stripe experienced a massive surge in business as consumers gravitated toward e-commerce.

This led to Stripe increasing headcount at a breakneck pace – according to LinkedIn data Stripe’s employee base more than doubled over the past two years.

The number of staff employed by the Irish-headquartered group of subsidiary companies nearly doubled to 1048 last year. The fastest growth in headcount was sales followed by engineering and user operations. It is unclear yet how many Irish jobs will be lost.

Hiring decisions were easy to justify during the pandemic. As Collison outlined on Friday both revenue and payment volume have since grown more than three-fold since.

However the world has again changed something Collison acknowledged. “We are facing stubborn inflation energy shocks higher interest rates reduced investment budgets and sparser startup funding” he wrote adding that many parts of the world seem to be heading toward recession.

The layoffs are sad but not surprising. When Stripe was last valued in a funding round in March of 2021 it was valued at $95 billion. This was at a peak of market and valuation exuberance. Things have changed radically since so much so that Stripe investors the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund cut the value of its Stripe holdings to $23.04 a share as of June 30 a 64 per cent reduction from the end of last year. In July Stripe took the step of reducing its internal valuation to $29 per ordinary share. That was a drop of 27 per cent from the peak.

Stripe is a massive success and a brilliant company. But like many other technology multinationals over the past two years it battled extensively in the war for talent essentially hoarding staff to fuel anticipated growth.

As Nat Friedman the former chief executive of Github put it on Twitter last week: “Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed and everyone who’s paying attention already knows this.”

This was something Sean wrote about in investing his column last week when he explained the hiring spree during the pandemic. In 2020 and 2021 during the lockdowns there was a spike in demand for digital products of many kinds. Valuations surged and companies working on the expectation that the pandemic trends would accelerate further kept on hiring.

As Sean put it:

“Looking at skyrocketing revenues and stock prices technology firms went on a hiring spree. Meta and Alphabet were already huge companies in April 2021. Since then they’ve grown headcount by 33 and 38 per cent respectively — 47000 employees for Alphabet and 24000 for Meta. Note that headcount has kept growing in recent quarters long after it was clear that the slowdown was happening.”

And the slowdown has been apparent for a number of months as evident in the downbeat recent quarterly warnings by the likes of Amazon and Meta.

There are other reasons for the tech slump – Sean highlighted last week how Apple’s dominance had forced rivals into risky pivots while in a separate piece he also outlined the fundamental malfunctions within Twitter that Elon Musk has inherited.

Twitter of course was another company to announce heavy job cuts last week along with the likes of Lyft CloudKitchens OpenDoor and Dapper Labs.

Not all have operations in Ireland.

However the ongoing tech slump really matters for Ireland – our industrial model after all is based on securing foreign direct investment from big US multinationals. If they are in retreat the investment will most likely slow down or recede.

We have known about this risk for years and the recent announcement of the €6 billion National Reserve Fund is an acknowledgment of this. The importance of corporate money was highlighted yet again in the tax returns for October published last week.

The state reaped €16.6 billion in corporation tax for the 10 months to the end of October. This was a whopping €6 billion – or 69 per cent – ahead of the same period last year. Receipts for October alone were €2.3 billion which was €800 million up on the same month last year. The tax is expected to break the €20 billion barrier this year.

We know that some of this is one-off in nature. The Department of Finance said last week that the increase related to profits in a small number of companies in the multinational sector “which are unlikely to be repeated next year”.

Instead the excess corporation tax is likely the result of multinationals onshoring intellectual property to Ireland in a tax optimisation scheme known as the Green Jersey.

However many of the companies struggling at present are significant employers here and pay a significant amount of regular recurring corporation tax.

This is what makes the current slide so potentially dangerous for Ireland. As of now the money is rolling in. In the past it has allowed us to cover overruns in the health service and nurse the economy through the pandemic.

However it must now be used strategically to help Ireland expand its industrial model beyond luring and seducing multinationals something Stephen has written about extensively in the past.

Policymakers and commentators have long talked about the concentration risk in relation to corporation tax. While it has not filtered through to our tax take yet we saw last week how quickly the tide can turn for tech companies – no matter how big they are.

Here’s how he may build value,"Business: Crown Holdings is a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and sale of packaging products for consumer goods and industrial products. They operate in three segments: Beverage which accounts for roughly 70% of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization; Transit Packaging and Food both of which collectively make up the other approximately 30% of EBITDA. Their consumer packaging solutions primarily support the beverage and food industries through the sale of aluminum and steel cans. Their packaging for industrial products includes steel and plastic consumables and equipment paper-based protective packaging and plastic film consumables and equipment which are sold into the metals food and beverage construction agricultural corrugated and general industries.

Activist Commentary: Carl Icahn is the grandfather of shareholder activism and a true pioneer of the strategy. While he is not slowing down at all he has reached an agreement with his son Brett Icahn to rejoin the firm as the eventual successor. Brett plans to employ his father's favored approach of pushing companies to make changes designed to boost their stock prices though he hasn't ruled out friendly bets too. This is not a departure from the strategy Carl has succeeded with for many years. He can be friendly (i.e. Apple Netflix) or he can be confrontational (i.e. Forest Labs Biogen) often it depends on the response of management. Brett is an impressive activist investor in his own right not because he is Carl's son but because he has demonstrated a long track record of extremely successful activist investing. The Sargon Portfolio he co-headed at Icahn at one time totaled around $7 billion and included extremely profitable investments in companies such as Netflix Inc. and Apple Inc. The Sargon Portfolio significantly outperformed the market with an annualized return of 27%. However prior to that Brett started in 2002 with Icahn as an analyst and was later responsible for campaigns like Hain Celestial (280.3% return versus 46.7% for the S&P500) Take-Two Interactive (81.5% versus 64.5% for the S&P500) and Mentor Graphics (106.4% versus 79.4% for the S&P500).

Crown operates in a consolidated global market that only has four scaled players globally and high barriers to entry – regional monopolies due to shipping costs long-term contracts and training and experience to operate plants. They have an accelerating growth profile which is catalyzed by sustainability trends and changing consumer preference: About 75% of new products go into cans today versus approximately 30% in 2014. They also enjoy the downside protection of a non-cyclical product.

Crown grew EBITDA during the pandemic when demand for aluminum cans spiked since restaurants and bars were forced to close and consumers were buying canned cocktails and beer to consume at home. The company has underperformed its peers including its main competitor Ball. Last week they saw a steep drop in the stock price from $85.01 on Oct. 24 to $70.69 on Oct. 25 following their most recent earnings release. They attributed their lowered financial outlook to inflation high interest rates and unfavorable currency translation. This underperformance is also due to shuddered demand for canned beverages that exploded during the pandemic leading to an overage of inventory.

The opportunity to create shareholder value here is relatively simple: sell non-core businesses buy back shares and focus on the pure-play beverage business. The company announced its acquisition of Signode a transit packaging business for $3.9 billion in 2017 and might be reluctant to sell it for less than that now. However there is a lot of value to selling that business the least of which is the amount of proceeds they receive (within reason). There is more value in how they use those proceeds (i.e. buying back stock in an undervalued growing business). There is also tremendous value in freeing up management to focus on the core business and there is value to being a pure play business and getting a market multiple closer to their pure-play peer Ball. So management should not be as focused on what they can get for Signode as in what a sale allows them to do in the future. Crown also runs an aerosol and food-packaging business that manufactures cans for household products and snacks and still owns a minority stake in the European food-can business. Icahn believes that the company should sell all these non-core assets and focus on the beverage can business which has secular tailwinds and is undervalued relative to its pure-play peer. Using cash flow to strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock ahead of this would enhance shareholder returns as Crown closes this valuation gap.

Icahn is not the only activist with a position in Crown. Impactive Capital first disclosed a stake in Crown in their first quarter 2020 13F filing and has advocated for the company to pursue the same opportunities that Icahn is advocating for – divesting non-core assets and share buybacks. Shortly after Impactive took its position Crown announced a strategic review of its portfolio and capital allocation priorities. This resulted in the 80% divestiture of the company's European food can business in 2021. But there is clearly more portfolio simplification that can be done here. Impactive always has an environmental social and governance thesis in their investments and looks for situations where positive ESG improvements can drive value. This situation is no exception. Focusing on the growing aluminum can market as a replacement for plastic and glass is not only good for Crown but good for the environment. Because aluminum's inherent properties don't change through use or recycling cans are 100% recyclable repeatedly.

It is important to note that there is a ton of value here regardless of who is on the management team. I would not assume that Icahn or Impactive want to see a change in management here. But if management is not up to the task that is always a possibility. On a recent conference call Crown CEO Timothy Donahue said: ""You never like to say we're caught off guard but I think we were really."" When you are a CEO who has been caught off guard the last thing you want to see is Carl Icahn show up in your stock.

Apparently blackmail is the way to make it in Victorian England. Dr. Flint manufactures a cure-all “elixir” and has received a letter advising that a bottle has been poisoned. When tested the bottle did contain a toxin from a plant called the “angel of inferno.” The letter demands money or another bottle will be poisoned. The deadline in the letter has already passed by the time Flint brings it to Eliza.

Flint is rude patronizing and insists that she sign a confidentiality agreement before taking on his case but he also offers a fat roll of cash up front. She agrees.

It turns out Flint came to Eliza so late because he has been shopping his case to other detectives; she was the cheapest. Eliza learns this after following a man who has been watching her to Nash and Sons the firm of detective Patrick Nash—who has no sons as Eliza likes to point out. Nash has been compiling a file on Eliza. At first he found her amusing but has since come to see her as a rival—and he wants her to work for him.

Eliza knows Nash uses blackmail to solve cases and he tries the same tactic on her when she refuses his job offer. He can’t have her undercutting his prices so he’ll give Flint his services for free to put her out of business. They’ll just have to compete to see who can solve the case first.

Scotland Yard is also home to some shady practices. When the police commissioner pays a visit and discovers his son Fitzroy on administrative duty—Fitzroy’s request granted by William—he demands that Fitzroy go back to detective work and make inspector by the end of the year. Superintendent Munro orders William to transfer Fitzroy to another detective even though he knows Fitzroy isn’t up for the work yet. He’s trying to protect both his and William’s careers.

The next time William sees Fitzroy his face has been bruised by his father. When William hears Fitzroy’s new commander yelling at him before a raid on a dangerous gang William pulls Fitzroy to help him with a case saving him. When Munro finds out that William again disobeyed him he warns William that he is a dangerous enemy.

Eliza continues to encounter blackmail-like bargaining as she investigates. At the Royal Botanical Society which grows the tropical angel of inferno in a members-only section she poses as a prospective member. The curator Humphries is willing to let Eliza skip the line to join the society if she’ll have dinner with him. But she just wants access to the membership list and nearly gets it through some clever acting until she is interrupted by the arrival of the “police”: Nash. Humphries gives Nash the list to survey and Eliza has to leave.

Ivy used to swear by Flint’s elixir and remembers that it used to be called “Flint and Doyle’s.” Eliza sets off to speak to Flint’s assistant Doyle. When she arrives at his office she finds Flint being examined by a Dr. Stanhope—Flint is in poor health. He and Stanhope leave and Doyle explains that Flint met his father in India while looking for restorative herbs. His father moved to England changed his name to Doyle and became Flint’s partner but Flint removed Doyle’s name from the product when he died.

Suspecting that Doyle harbors some resentment towards Flint Eliza follows him—to an event at the Royal Botanical Society. But a woman runs into her plants a purse in her pocket and then gets her arrested for stealing—all as Nash looks on smiling.

Eliza was supposed to bring details of the case to William by the end of the day—he insisted as a matter of public security after she complained about the case. When she doesn’t he visits her home and invites himself in to wait obliviously crashing Ivy’s dinner with her new friend the mortuary clerk Potts. Eliza disapproves of this “dalliance” but has been trying to leverage it to make Potts help her in cases by promising to put in a good word about him to Ivy. Potts is therefore placed in an uncomfortable position as William complains about Eliza and Ivy defends her. Potts tries his best to swallow his distaste and agree with Ivy.

Eliza is bailed out not by William but the journalist Basil Sinclaire. Anytime he runs stories about the “lady detective” his newspaper sells well so he wants to write about her latest case. And if she doesn’t agree he’ll simply make Nash the hero instead—blackmail again.

Eliza returns to the Botanical Society and asks Humphries about the previous day’s event. He explains that it was a book sale to raise funds for a charity called the Woolidge Trust that provides medicine to the poor. The book has a chapter on the angel of inferno and its special poisonous and luminous properties but Nash bought the last copy so Eliza has to find one at a bookstore.

William insists that Eliza share her case file with him and when she tells him she was trying to impress him with her work before sharing it he agrees to let her work the case with him. Fitzroy does research and explains that Flint recently outbid the Woolidge Trust on land it had been promised for a hospital for the poor in order to build another factory. Doyle attended a Woolidge Trust fundraiser had access to the angel of inferno via the Botanical Society and had reason to resent Flint: he must be the blackmailer.

Alas William and Eliza arrive at his office to find him poisoned but still alive. Flint has received another blackmail letter but he refuses to open it now that Doyle has been hurt: Doyle is the closest thing he has to a son. Dr. Stanhope who is attending Doyle tells Eliza he thinks Flint should simply pay the blackmail.

Eliza calls Basil to her office. She has solved the case: Humphries is the blackmailer. His typewriter matches a malformed “x” in both blackmail letters. When Eliza arrives to arrest Humphries however Nash is already there—with Basil. Nash is a big advertiser in Basil’s newspaper and he enlisted the journalist to help him beat Eliza.

But Eliza knew of the double-cross as she tells Flint after Nash leaves with Humphries so she made Basil think Humphries was the suspect. In fact all typewriters of that make have such a malfunction. The culprit is instead Stanhope who knew the exact blackmail amount even though the second letter had not yet been opened. He’s the chairman of the Woolidge Trust and on the board of the Botanical Society. The blackmail money was to go back to the Trust to help it recover after losing the hospital land.

It will get the land anyway: relieved that Doyle is recovering Flint makes him an equal partner in the business and agrees to his request that they donate the land back to the Trust—in Doyle’s father’s name.

Eliza gloats to Nash that Basil’s story identifying Humphries as the culprit will run and sully Nash’s reputation plus possibly initiate a lawsuit from Humphries. But Nash still wants Eliza to work for him and will use any means to achieve his goal. Perhaps there’s something about Moses he can use to blackmail Eliza.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15c21hcnRwcmljZS5jb20vZ2Vhci9nYW1pbmcvZ2FtaW5nLWZlYXR1cmVzL2d0YS1nYW1lcy1leHBsYWluZWQv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlzbWFydHByaWNlLmNvbS9nZWFyL2dhbWluZy9nYW1pbmctZmVhdHVyZXMvZ3RhLWdhbWVzLWV4cGxhaW5lZC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GTA Games Explained: From GTA Vice City to GTA V Every Major Games from Rockstar In Chronological Order,"The GTA franchise has had a chokehold on the industry for the last couple of decades in a way that perhaps no other franchise in the history of games. From the moment the Houser brothers arrived on the scene with 2 unabashedly violent and almost-exhibitionist games in Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 the industry was put on notice.

While the first couple of games didn’t quite have the polish or the quality to stand the test of time – Rockstar Games would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were here to stay as they made one heck of a statement with GTA III. Since that point Rockstar has gone from strength to strength releasing an unbelievably successful string of games rarely ever faltering in their 2 decade-long run.

The publisher has confirmed GTA 6 as being in development and while we wait for the next game to arrive sometime in the next couple of years or so – it’s time to take a look at each mainline entry in the series and see what makes each of them special.

Every Single Mainline GTA Game Explained

GTA 1 and 2

The first two games in the series developed by DMA Design (later rebranded to Rockstar North) did just well enough for Rockstar and their publishers and parent company Take-Two Interactive to greenlight a sequel. The games themselves aren’t really all that polished and going back to them now only further solidifies how much the franchise has grown beyond its narrow scope and scale.

The first game featured six levels split between 3 main cities – San Andreas Liberty City and Vice City. This would go on to form the foundations of the series heading forward and it seems to have been the game’s biggest contribution to the franchise. Both games feature a very skeletal plot that only serves as a way to drive the game forward and introduce new levels to the player.

The gameplay here constitutes simply running and gunning all over the city and occasionally popping into vehicles and causing all sorts of general mayhem across the city. The games were criticized for their reckless abandon in their approach toward violence and graphic content in games. While the games weren’t all that great themselves the media storm they kicked up would provide Rockstar with all sorts of notoriety that allowed them to push the boundaries even further and carve a place in the mainstream.

GTA III

The game that really set the world alight and had droves of players lining up for a copy of the game outside stores Grand Theft Auto III couldn’t have made a bolder statement on arrival. Ditching the top-down perspective Grand Theft Auto III featured a rather large 3D open world the likes of which hadn’t been seen before. Also new for the franchise was an actual plot that followed our protagonist’s life of crime in Liberty City.

The game kicks off with our protagonist Claude pulling off a robbery with his girlfriend Catalina. As the pair were escaping Claude is gunned down and betrayed by Catalina leaving him for dead as the police arrest him. On the way to prison the transport is attacked by members of the Colombian Cartel which allows Claude and his new friend 8-Ball to escape.

Following the escape Claude finds himself allying with the Leone Mafia family as he completes several jobs for them across the city – including hits robberies and extortion. In his time as a gun for the mob he earns the respect of Don Salvatore Leone who enlists him in a war against the Triads and the Colombian Cartel. Leone’s wife Maria eventually convinces Leone of an affair between her and Claude which prompts Leone to send hitmen after the pair.

As the pair escape and find themselves under the threat of three rival factions – the Mafia the Yakuza and the Cartel now led by Claude’s former girlfriend Catalina. Claude barely escapes death and finds retribution against Catalina by gunning her down and freeing a captive Maria. The game ends with the pair walking away as Maria complains about the kidnapping.

GTA Vice City

The next game in the series was not a numbered title but was in fact a full-fledged sequel to 2001’s GTA III. Vice City was a game set in the 80s years before the events of Grand Theft Auto III. This time around the game followed a brand-new protagonist Tommy Vercetti as he attempts to climb the criminal ladder in Vice City a fictionalized version of Miami.

The gameplay was a significant step up from the 2001 game and featured a number of improvements to movement and traversal that greatly impressed fans. While the combat remained as clunky as ever fans appreciated the significant step-up in presentation as well as the quality of storytelling.

The story begins with our protagonist Tommy Vercetti fresh out of prison and sent into Vice City to complete a drug deal. Unbeknownst to Tommy his sole purpose in Vice City is to lay the groundwork for the Forelli family in Vice City and eventually give way to Sonny Forelli the head of the crime family to take his place. The deal however goes horribly wrong as both the money and the merchandise are stolen.

This leaves Tommy to track down the parties behind the setup – leading him to Ricardio Diaz a local drug kingpin. Tommy enlists the help of Lance Vance someone who was also wronged by Diaz and the pair plot a plan to eliminate Diaz and take his place as kingpins of Vice City. The pair are successful but as Tommy grows in power Lance grows increasingly resentful of Tommy.

Tommy Vercetti eliminates all threats to his empire and becomes the most dangerous man in all of Vice City in the process. Towards the end he is betrayed by Lance as Sonny comes into town to take Tommy’s place. In a Scarface-like showdown at Tommy’s manor our protagonist comes out on top and eliminates Sonny’s and Lance’s forces.

GTA San Andreas

Perhaps the most beloved entry in the series Grand Theft Auto San Andreas featured perhaps the most ambitious open world in the history of the franchise – blowing everything else that came before out of the water. The game featured not one but three cities in the state of San Andreas – Los Santos Las Venturas and San Fierro.

The game featured a variety of new mechanics including a new RPG-like system of stats such as Muscle Stamina and Fat. This introduced a whole bunch of new side activities such as the Gym Fast Food restaurants and even Dating. The game is still the best-selling game on the PS2 and it is easy enough to see why. The game’s ambitious open world polished mechanics and the increasingly hilarious and wacky story made for some of gaming’s best moments ever.

The story follows our protagonist Carl “CJ” Johnson returning to his hometown Los Santos for his mother’s funeral. He finds that his mother’s death was the result of a gang drive-by as he discovers his former gang Grove Street Families is in complete disarray and without direction. CJ reluctantly comes into contact with a corrupt CRASH officer Officer Tenpenny (voiced by Samuel L Jackson) as he completes various assignments for him.

Along the way he discovers the true culprits behind the attack on his mother as he discovers his childhood friends and gangmates “Big Smoke” and “Ryder” were behind the attack. Following a sprawling adventure throughout the 3 cities that feature all sorts of wackiness with the Triads and government agencies – CJ emerges victorious as he puts down Big Smoke Ryder and Officer Tenpenny.

GTA IV

Grand Theft Auto IV is a major outlier in the franchise and a huge departure from the rest of the series. To this day by far Grand Theft Auto IV is the darkest entry in the series and its rich deep undertones of commentary and satire continue to impress fans. The game came out in 2008 and still stands as the most well-reviewed game in the series.

The game was not without its detractors as many still hold critiques against the game for its snail-like pace and lack of mission variety. GTA IV might not have been the most outright “exciting” game in the series given its darker storyline – it still holds high regard in player’s minds for its commitment to storytelling.

The game kicks off with Eastern-European immigrant Niko Belic arriving on the shores of Liberty City to reunite with his cousin and help him in his “flourishing” business. He is later confronted with the truth that his cousin’s business is failing and that Niko will have to dip his toes back into a life of crime he had long abandoned.

His struggle to survive in Liberty City has him working for the Russian mob in LC and somehow finding a way to keep himself and his brother alive. The game quickly takes a darker turn as it is revealed that Niko arrived in LC with the sole purpose of revenge as he hunts down his former CO from his time in the army. This cold-blooded revenge tale sees Niko going up against some of the most powerful people in LC while trying to keep things together.

GTA V

The last entry in the series was in many ways the magnum opus that Rockstar had been working towards with previous titles. The game featured not one but three protagonists – Michael Trevor and Franklin. All 3 characters had unique personalities and playing as each one provided a whole new perspective of the story.

Players could freely switch between the 3 characters which made for a refreshing change of pace. The game was built on the latest iteration of the RAGE engine which provided one of the best-looking games of its generation. The polished cover system and gunplay went a long way in making GTA V one of the best games of all-time which is reflected in its position as one of the highest-selling games of all-time.

The story initially followed Michael De Santa formerly known as Michael Townley who faked his death during a bank robbery to escape the clutches of the law by cutting a deal with an FIB agent. Several years later a retired Michael is set upon by Franklin who attempts to “reposesses” a vehicle from Michael’s house. Michael then mentors Franklin as he teaches him the ways of robbery and the two become a formidable pair.

The news of Michael pulling off heists reaches Trevor a raging drug kingpin who reconnects and with Michael in LS. The trio then pull of several heists across Los Santos in a bid to stay alive and get rich while doing it. The trio are hunted down by various crime factions including a mercenary group and government agencies.

Silicon Valley is one of the largest and most prominent tech hubs in the world. It accounts for about one-third of America’s national investment capital and it houses the headquarters of over 30 companies in the Fortune 1000.

Given its world-class reputation it’s the dream of many tech workers to land a job in a Silicon Valley company. But what’s the best route for getting there?

While there is certainly no clear-cut path one way to try and answer this question is by looking at the universities and colleges that Silicon Valley employees graduate from.

This interactive map by ​Stephanie Cristea shows the top feeder schools to some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley.

A Look at The Top 30 Schools

The data for this graphic comes from a study by College Transitions which looks at the top feeder schools for 12 different companies with employees in Silicon Valley including Twitter Alphabet DocuSign Meta and eight other large businesses.

Using publicly available data from LinkedIn the study looked at more than 70000 entry level engineers and IT employees at these 12 different companies and identified where they received their undergraduate degree.

Here are the findings of the top 30 feeder schools across all 12 companies:

Rank (Total) Institution # Employed Top Employer 1 Carnegie Mellon University 1356 Google 2 University of Southern California 1252 Google 3 University of California Berkeley 1212 Google 4 Georgia Institute of Technology 1094 Microsoft 5 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 877 Google 6 University of Washington 876 Microsoft 7 University of California San Diego 795 Google 8 University of Waterloo 793 Google 9 University of California Los Angeles 704 Google 10 Stanford University 661 Google 11 Columbia University 651 Google 12 University of Michigan 632 Google 13 Cornell University 612 Google 14 Northeastern University 604 Google 15 University of Texas at Austin 578 Google 16 University of California Irvine 482 Google 17 San Jose State University 470 Google 18 Purdue University 469 Microsoft 19 University of Toronto 466 Google 20 New York University 464 Google 21 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 405 Google 22 University of Pennsylvania 352 Google 23 University of California Davis 333 Google 24 North Carolina State University 329 Google 25 University of Maryland 309 Google 26 Duke University 304 Google 27 Harvard University 260 Google 28 University of Wisconsin Madison 249 Google 29 University of Virginia 244 Microsoft 30 Brown University 236 Google

While this research is far from exhaustive it provides a glimpse of where 12 of the largest companies in Silicon Valley source their talent and what it takes to make it into the big leagues.

Adjusted Proportional Rankings

Next let’s look at the ranking after being adjusted proportionally for each school’s undergraduate enrollment numbers (so smaller schools can be fairly represented in the data):

Rank (Adjusted) Institution # Employed Top Employer 1 Carnegie Mellon University 1356 Google 2 Columbia University 651 Google 3 Stanford University 661 Google 4 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 405 Google 5 California Institute of Technology 78 Google 6 Harvey Mudd College 72 Google 7 Georgia Institute of Technology 1094 Microsoft 8 University of Southern California 1252 Google 9 Rice University 235 Google 10 Harvard University 260 Google 11 Duke University 304 Google 12 Cornell University 612 Google 13 Northeastern University 604 Google 14 University of California Berkeley 1212 Google 15 University of Pennsylvania 352 Google 16 Princeton University 170 Google 17 Brown University 236 Google 18 Santa Clara University 180 Google 19 Northwestern University 226 Google 20 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 877 Google 21 Swarthmore College 36 Google 22 University of California San Diego 795 Google 23 University of Washington 876 Microsoft 24 Yale University 115 Google 25 Washington University in St. Louis 183 Google 26 Johns Hopkins University 143 Google 27 University of Chicago 156 Google 28 University of California Los Angeles 704 Google 29 University of Waterloo 793 Google 30 University of Michigan 632 Google

Interestingly when looking at the adjusted figures only two of the top 10 feeder schools are Ivy League institutions: Columbia which comes second on the list and Harvard which just makes the cut at number 10.

Carnegie Mellon takes first place with over 1300 hired graduates across all 12 companies. While the Pittsburgh-based university is not an Ivy League school it still has a great reputation—in a recent study by U.S. News & World Report it ranked as one of the best universities in America.

Even with its excellent reputation Carnegie Mellon’s acceptance rate is relatively high at 17% especially when compared to its Ivy League counterparts like Columbia (6%) and Harvard (4%).

It’s worth mentioning that while Ivy League didn’t dominate the top 10 list all eight schools made it into the top 30. So while this data shows that Silicon Valley isn’t exclusively hiring from Ivy League schools it does indicate that these prestigious institutions have a seat at the table.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy10cm9sbHMtaXRzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1tY3JpYi1mYXJld2VsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's McRib 'Farewell' Isn't a Real Goodbye,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/mcdonalds-trolls-its-customers-mcrib-farewell on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy10cm9sbHMtaXRzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1tY3JpYi1mYXJld2VsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vZS52bmV4cHJlc3MubmV0L25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL3NoaXBwaW5nLWZpcm1zLXNhaWwtcGFzdC1hbm51YWwtcHJvZml0LXRhcmdldC1pbi05LW1vbnRocy00NTMyNzg0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shipping firms sail past annual profit target in 9 months,"Many shipping firms have earned profits surpassing their annual target in the first nine months of the year riding a wave of high demand and high freight rates.

The Petrovietnam Transportation Corporation recorded after-tax profits of nearly VND390 billion ($15.7 million) in the third quarter more than 2.5 times year-on-year. Its pre-tax profits of over VND1.035 trillion in the first nine months exceeded 72% of its annual plan.

The Hai An Transport and Stevedoring Joint Stock Company saw its Q3 after-tax profit increase by over 2.7 times year-on-year to VND270 billion. The firm’s profit in the first nine months was 1.5 times bigger than its yearly plan.

Similarly Gemadept Corporation’s profit in the third quarter surged by over 76% to nearly VND290 billion. Its after-tax profit rose nearly 84% realizing 94% of the annual plan.

The Vietnam Ocean Shipping Jsc Earned gained pre-tax profits of VND566 billion in the first nine months a 38% year-on-year increase and exceeding the annual plan by 45%.

While it saw a fall in Q3 profit the Vietnam National Shipping Lines posted profits of over VND2.77 trillion in the first nine months a year-on-year increase of more than 30% and more than 10% of the annual plan.

Many shipping firms attribute the bigger profits to high demand and high freight charges. A manager with the Petrovietnam Transportation Corporation said freight charges had increased in the third quarter resulting in bigger revenues.

Over 77.8 million tons of cargo was transported by sea in the first nine months up 27.5% over the same period last year according to the General Statistics Office.

According to data from Freightos one of the world’s largest freight booking platforms Feightos Baltic Index the global container shipping index fell from $6577 to $4060 in the third quarter. However the rate was still 2-3 times higher than the average of $1800-2000 in the same period last year. Compared with the third quarter of 2019 the rate was nearly 3.5 times higher.

In Vietnam the sea freight index increased nearly 5% in the third quarter and rose over 11% in the first nine months.

Brokerage firm SSI Securities has predicted that the global index will gradually return to normal due to weaker demand and bigger supply of container ships in the last months of this year. Freight charges may decrease sharply next year if supply chain disruptions die down and China reopens to the outside world it said.

In Vietnam charges may remain at their peak in 2023 as the market is still undersupplied as most of the Vietnamese fleet is leased to foreign markets under long-term contracts according to SSI Securities."

The 2024 election could see a rematch of Trump versus Joe Biden. Current president Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2022 election.

A return of Trump to the Oval Office could greatly impact several U.S. business sectors. One sector that could be impacted is the automotive sector with Biden and the Democratic-led Congress supporting the growth of electric vehicles. Trump has not been a strong advocate of EVs.

What Happened: An ongoing feud between Trump and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has escalated in recent years with name-calling increasing after Musk publicly supported Ron DeSantis who would be a potential opponent of Trump for the Republican nomination.

Musk said at the time that Trump would be “too old to be chief executive of anything let alone the United States of America.”

Musk said Trump should instead “sail into the sunset” and stop his political aspirations.

Trump has called Musk “sloppy” and suggested he was on drugs. Trump also referred to Musk as an idiot after learning he had supported DeSantis.

The escalation increased as Musk has both supported and made fun of Truth Social a social media platform owned by the Trump Media & Technology Group.

“It (Truth Social) is essentially a rightwing echo chamber. It might as well be called Trumpet” Musk said of Truth Social.

Trump Media & Technology Group is in the process of merging with Digital World Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:DWAC).

Although there have been moments of agreement between Trump and Musk as the former president praised the acquisition of Twitter by Musk. The praise by Trump could come as Musk has publicly said that he might overturn the ban of Trump on the social media platform.

Musk also shared a since-deleted picture of himself Trump and Kanye West who acquired Parler as the three musketeers with the respective social media networks they own.

Here’s a look at how Tesla has performed against the S&P 500 since Trump announced he was running for President of the United States and who had the last laugh.

Investing in Tesla: Trump formally announced his presidential candidacy on June 16 2015 at the Trump Tower in New York City.

Trump running for office and ultimately beating Hillary Clinton to be elected president was expected to be negative for a company like Tesla that had benefitted from some form of clean energy support from President Barack Obama.

Tesla shares did not fall under Trump’s time in office and instead have been one of the best-performing stocks since 2015.

Tesla shares hit a split-adjusted high of $16.75 on June 16 2015. A $1000 investment could have purchased 59.70 shares of Tesla on the heels of Trump’s announcement. That $1000 investment would be worth $12474.32 today representing a return of 1147.4%.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) hit a high of $210.35 on June 16 2015 the day of Trump’s announcement. A $1000 investment could have purchased 4.75 shares of SPY. That $1000 investment would be worth $1787.62 today representing a return of 78.8%.

As you can see the investment in Tesla significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

Sometimes politicians and those in charge of countries and policies matter less than a company’s financials and growth.

Why Did Tesla Remove Sensors From Its Cars?

Did you know that Tesla vehicles have long come standard with a series of ultra sonic sensors that help detect objects and proximity? These are getting removed in 2023 vehicles.

In an interview between Andrej Karpathy and Lex Fridman there was a discussion of why Tesla removed its ultra sonic sensors from its vehicles. This will cause Tesla vehicles to rely solely on vision with cameras.

Andrej talks about this and thinks that one would think the sensors are an asset to you. If you consider the entire product the sensors are a liability. They require a supply chain they can have problems they are part of the supply chain they require integration and teams to write firm ware to use them. There is bloat that comes with using them.

Elon Musk is really good at simplifying things. He understands the entropy that occurs in organizations when you have extra parts. When you think about the totality of the cost and maintenance of the sensors it is a liability. In this case vision can give you everything the sensors can.

Bloat in the Data Engine

Lex and Andrej talk about the data engine and the ultra sonic sensors. The sensors require additional code and storage and bloat everything. It can be very distracting if you want to get just vision to work. If you are making progress yet still have to support sensors you have extra code that is needed and that bloats the system.

Simplifying the system in the long run seems to be the right solution. This applies generally across most systems. Lex asked about Lidar and if it is needed. Andrej is confused by the debate. He thinks the debate is really do you have a fleet to collect data or not and that is more important than whether you have Lidar or not.

Similar to the discussion of radar Andrej thinks that Lidar doesn't offer much extra information. It adds cost bloat creates entropy and is similar to the ultra sonic sensors in the extra cost and bloat it adds. Andrej thinks that other companies are going to eventually drop Lidar.

Lex asked if you can build a big fleet that can collect data and have Lidar be part of that collection process. Andrej looks at it that vision is necessary and that the world is designed for human eyes and consumption. Vision gives you all the data you need to drive you car. You would have to be really sure to add an additional sensor of any kind.

In the end Andrej says the answer is no to extra sensors. When asked about high definition maps and geo-fencing Andrej said that that is not scalable. Pre mapping the environments is not going to work because you have to remap the environment. A vehicle most be able to adapt to the world around it. If you need to maintain a centimeter accurate map of earth that is a huge dependency that you are taking on. Do you really need this? Humans don't need it...

Over the course of that time they've put quite a few miles on it all while putting it through the paces in a number of ways. Regardless of how it performed in various tests the important part here is that the editors at Edmunds got to learn precisely what it's like to live with the most popular Tesla model. Now it's time for them to let us know what they learned.

Edmunds' 2020 Model Y is the range-topping dual-motor all-wheel-drive Performance model with the free Performance Upgrade package. It started at around $61000 when they bought it though they paid $2500 to upgrade the paint color and $5000 for Tesla's Full Self-Driving Capability package.

The editors at Edmunds have been driving the Tesla SUV for two years now during which they've racked up 25000 miles. We've been following their articles and videos about the electric crossover quite closely. Along the way it has seemed as though they like many aspects of the car though they have also shared plenty of complaints.

With all of that said Edmunds aims to set the record straight in this video letting us all know what it's been like to live with the Model Y how they feel about it as a whole and whether or not it lives up to the hype. Heck this Tesla electric SUV may end up being one of the best-selling cars in the world this year so it'll be nice to know if it's because it deserves such an honor or if it's simply a ""fad"" or ""bandwagon"" situation.

At any rate Edmunds admits it experienced many Model Y quirks and it was certainly unhappy with the crossover's build quality. Moreover the publication bought the FSD package hoping to be able to take advantage of it but knowing full well it may not materialize on a timeline even close to Elon Musk's optimistic outlook.

Edmunds also admits that regardless of any of the issues or concerns it raised about the Model Y it honestly liked its time with the car overall. This is because all cars have their fair share of flaws and while the Tesla did work to irritate them on occasion it also proved just as many positives.

Since you're not really here to read words on the page we'll leave you to click on the video above and take it all in for yourself. Edmunds provided the following simple topics with timestamps just in case you want to focus in on something specific. However the video is relatively short and we found it worthwhile to watch it in its entirety.

Given the wealth of topics relevant to embedded systems how much emphasis should I place on assembly language?

A single 15-week semester isn’t long enough to accommodate a complete treatment of all relevant topics on the subject of embedded systems. In developing the curriculum for my course I have tried to prioritize the practice of marketable skills (to some extent) but a university course should also provide more depth than a tech boot camp. Nevertheless every time we progress to the unit of the course where we revert for a few weeks from C language to assembly language I approach Google and ask:

“Should I learn assembly language for embedded software development?”

In this article I'll try to objectively support or refute the typical answers to this question that are found on software development forums and other web outlets. Ultimately my aim is to help you the reader decide whether or not your specific situation warrants learning or teaching how to program in assembly language.

Does Assembly Language Make Debugging Software Easier?

This is theoretically true; however the debugging advantage afforded by knowing assembly language rarely materializes in practice. Many microcontroller development boards are equipped with in-circuit debuggers (Figure 1) allowing the developer to set breakpoints pause execution and run their code line-by-line in their integrated development environment (IDE).

Figure 1. Like many other development boards the MSP-EXP432P4111 LaunchPad from Texas Instruments (TI) includes an in-circuit debugger.

When the execution is paused the debugger also allows the user to peek at the contents of the central processing unit (CPU) and peripheral registers for the microcontroller.

The line-by-line execution of code almost always maps to lines in the user’s C code. Though technically a proxy for line-by-line execution of machine code this allows a developer to sift through their software in search of runtime bugs without ever having to actually look at and interpret the compiler-generated assembly code (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Line-by-line execution of C code in TI Code Composer Studio [click to enlarge].

Despite that there are certainly cases where a runtime bug has led me to look in the disassembly view of my code (where the IDE maps assembler mnemonics to machine code); however those instances are extremely infrequent. Furthermore I can’t remember a time when I looked at the disassembly view and discovered my bug through that process; more often I discover my error in plain view in my C code after walking away to get coffee and then coming back. My conclusion from personal experience is that the power of assembly language knowledge in debugging embedded software is significantly diminished by the effectiveness of line-by-line in-circuit debugging in C code (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Line-by-line execution of assembly code in disassembly view in TI Code Composer Studio [click to enlarge]

Is Assembly Language Needed For Embedded Development Jobs?

Annually IEEE Spectrum releases survey results showing the most popular programming languages for that year. This year 2022 when listed according to job postings assembly language ranked 30th on the list (behind even Cobol!) while C and C++ ranked 6th and 7th respectively. These rankings are across all industries so it’s no surprise that C/C++ should rank so highly and assembly so low. However sifting through job postings in the realm of embedded software and IoT (Internet-of-Things) device development confirms that C experience is more often listed as a required skill than assembly language.

Despite its lower skill ranking in recent job postings it can often depend on the specific career path you choose. For example in offensive and defensive cyberwarfare assembly language or code can help boost your resume. In an accompanying article to those IEEE Spectrum survey results it is mentioned that many job listings in cybersecurity and cyberwarfare call for assembly language experience.

This implies that there are careers where assembly language programming is an important skill; though those jobs may not be in embedded systems development. Another web search for jobs in compiler engineering and design however reveals an industry where assembly language experience is a must. Novel architectures are being developed every year for specialized purposes such as rendering video running neural networks and edge computing. Developers are being hired to write efficient compilers targeted to these architectures and applications.

Furthermore there are several communities of developers working on open-source compiler tools (ex. Gnu Compiler Collection or the LLVM Project). Assembly experience is required to make meaningful contributions to those projects too. So if you are interested in pursuing that type of work then learning to program in assembly language is not only a good idea it’s mandatory. However if you want to get a job in embedded software development the benefit of learning assembly is more nuanced. You might be better off honing your C skills.

Are Programs Written in Assembly Language Faster and Smaller Than C?

For this answer to carry weight we must be designing a system with speed or space constraints that are so great that we would sacrifice development time code portability and code maintainability to meet them. That is rarely the case. Manufacturers sell devices now with abundant program memory and processors are so speedy they can run a Python interpreter right on board. Some of these issues can be addressed using assembly language in embedded development and are most easily solved in the device selection stage of hardware design. In other words if your compiled C code isn’t going to fit or run fast enough use a bigger or faster device.

Moreover it’s only partly true that assembly programs are faster than those compiled from C. Compilers are not as inherently inefficient as they once were because it’s in the best interest of the companies creating the compilers—often the chip manufacturers themselves—to distribute the most efficient tool possible. If your compiled code is slow the bottom line suffers. While it’s possible for a programmer to know little tricks to shave off clock cycles in assembly language the compiler knows many of its own tricks and it never forgets to use them. Therefore even though there are specific cases where writing directly in assembly language produces faster programs than compiled C the size and speed of available hardware combined with the development tools can nullify these benefits of writing embedded software in assembly language.

Assembly Language Teaches You About Past Microprocessor Programming

Often to know where the future of electronic design is heading it's necessary to understand the past. In this case understanding how microprocessors were programmed in the past can be compelling since I am nostalgic by nature. Plus I love learning about the history of computing and electronics. However if a hands-on history lesson is a goal writing assembly code for an Atmega328P or the ARM core in a Raspberry Pi won’t be nearly as satisfying or authentic as learning to write code for say the MOS 6502 (which you can do here). An example device using the MOS 6502 is the Commodore 64 shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Commodore 64 is one of the many devices powered by the MOS 6502 microprocessor. Image used courtesy of Evan-Amos on Wikimedia Commons

Of course if you really want to write assembly for your Raspberry Pi there are books for that too (see Raspberry Pi Assembly Language Programming: ARM Processor Coding by Stephen Smith for example). Learning to program in assembly language for the joy of the experience is a great reason but programming in assembly language is not common practice in modern embedded software development. And this does not make a compelling reason for an instructor to include assembly language programming in their curriculumn.

Assembly Language Helps Programmers Understand Processors

Finally the most compelling reason to me for learning assembly language is because it allows a programmer to better understand what the processor is actually doing at the lowest level. In my course I prioritize depth of coverage over quantity of marketable skills. If you want to know what is really going on at every step of execution learning assembly language is the best way to achieve that goal.

Assembly knowledge also allows you to explore what your compiler does to convert high-level conditional statements and loops in C to machine code. As much grumbling as I witness from students in the process I know they are gaining a unique understanding of the execution of code that they can only achieve by programming in assembly.

Conclusion—There is No One-size-fits-all Answer

This article gives a fairly comprehensive survey of the reasons given online for learning assembly language each with its own merits. However when deciding whether or not to learn or teach assembly language each person’s specific context and goals matter. Someone looking to add marketable skills to their resume might be better served by practicing C development for a different microcontroller than they are used to. Another person might be genuinely curious about the topic and therefore motivated to learn something new. There is no harm in that!

I decided to teach assembly language for a few weeks in my embedded systems course because I want students to better understand what a computing device actually does and how that differs from their assumptions based on the code they have written in C.

Locomotor activity of uninfected female An. gambiae in the absence of human odour (Supplementary Figs. 1a and 1c) significantly declined with age post-blood meal when assessed in Drosophila activity monitors (χ2 1 = 5.86 p = 0.02; Fig. 1ab). This age effect was not observed following infection with P. falciparum (χ2 1 = 0.83 p = 0.35; Fig. 1b; Supplementary Figs. 1a and 2a). In the presence of human odour the age-dependent reduction in locomotor activity was observed in both uninfected (χ2 1 = 21.12 p < 0.001) and P. falciparum carrying mosquitoes (χ2 1 = 5.73 p = 0.02; the GLMM:lmer model was constrained by age and the random effect of experimental replication; Fig. 1b; Supplementary Figs. 1b and 2b). The infection load increased with age post-blood meal and was consistent across replicates (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Figure 1 HYPERLINK ""sps:id::fig1||locator::gr1||MediaObject::0""Plasmodium falciparum infection stage differentially affects mosquito locomotor activity. Schematic design of the locomotor assay (a) used to assess the activity of female Anopheles gambiae 7 days post-infection (dpi) and 14 dpi with P. falciparum compared to age-matched uninfected females (days control dc) in the presence (with human odour) or absence of human odour (w/o human odour). Individual locomotor profiles (n = 384) assessed for variation using a redundancy analysis demonstrated a differential effect of age post-blood meal (the mixed model was build based on the effect of age as a main fixed variable combined with the random effect of the other variables; β-lmer ± SE = age + experimental replication|1); (b) infection (the model demonstrated the effect of the main fixed variable of infection including the rest of the variables as random variables ; β-lmer ± SE = infection + experimental replication|1); and (c) on locomotor activity in the presence and absence of human odour. (d) Diel locomotor activity profiles of 7 and 14 dpi females along with age-matched controls demonstrated effects of both age post-blood meal and infection in the presence and absence of human odour during informative activity periods (photophase Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 0–11; dusk ZT 11–12; scotophase ZT 12–23; and dawn ZT 23–34) over a 24 h period (the mixed model estimated the effect of all four main fixed variables including age infection time human odour as well as the random effect of the experimental replication combined with the interactions among all these variables; β-lmer ± SE = age + infection + time + human odour + experimental replication|1). Significant effects were determined using GLMM models (lmer). Bars represented by β-estimation generated by the mixed model ± SE (β-lmer ± SE); asterisks denote significant differences (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns non-significant). Letters indicate the pairwise comparisons between infected and uninfected groups; a = p < 0.001 b = p < 0.01 c = p < 0.05 d = non-significant). Full size image

Infection status significantly affected the activity of mosquitoes when comparing the overall locomotion profiles of 7 dpi and 14 dpi individuals with age-matched uninfected females in the presence and absence of human odour (β-estimated = weighted mean value based on all variables plus the random effect of the replication ± SE; presence of human odour: χ2 1 = 18.06 p < 0.001; absence of human odour: χ2 1 = 5.73 p < 0.01). In the absence of human odour 7 dpi females were less active compared to age-matched controls (χ2 1 = 8.21 p = 0.004; Supplementary Fig. 1) whereas 14 dpi females were as active as their age-matched controls (χ2 1 = 2.27 p = 0.13; Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1c). A continuous temporal activity analysis which provides a sliding moving average of a single variable i.e. locomotion (Supplementary Fig. 1) supported the overall GLMM statistical model which combines multiple variables as well as their interaction (Fig. 1) and the overall finding of this experiment. However the continuous temporal activity analysis also identified a discrepancy in which 14 dc females appeared to be more active than 14 dpi females during scotophase (Supplementary Fig. 1ac). This emphasises the statistical power of using multi-variable models for studying complex ecological interactions. The presence of human odour differentially altered the locomotor activity. While there were no significant differences between 7 dpi and age-matched females in the presence of human odour (χ2 1 = 0.12 p = 0.73; Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1b) the salivary gland sporozoite-infectious 14 dpi mosquitoes were more active than age-matched uninfected females (14 days control; 14 dc χ2 1 = 8.80 p = 0.002; Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1d).

Mosquito locomotor activity varies temporally in response to host odour and P. falciparum infection

To assess the diurnal effect on the locomotor activity of mosquitoes26 with P. falciparum infection and their respective controls a mixed model analysis was used (lmer model: constrained by two main explanatory variables infection status and period of time as well as the random effect of replication; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In the absence of human odour the diurnal locomotor activity profile of uninfected mosquitoes confirmed the high activity at dawn (ZT 23–24) with the younger cohort being more active during scotophase with a peak at dawn (Supplementary Fig. 1a) whereas the older control females displayed an increased activity at dusk and scotophase (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 27.43 p < 0.001; ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 4.58 p = 0.049; ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 4.33 p = 0.03; ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 32.32 p < 0.001 Fig. 1d Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 1c). In the presence of human odour the locomotor activity of the younger uninfected cohort increased at dawn and remained at this activity level until dusk (Supplementary Fig. 1b) while the older females only displayed an increase in activity at dusk (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 17.54 p < 0.001; ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 7.67 p = 0.005; ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 15.21 p < 0.001; ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 18.25 p < 0.001 Fig. 1d Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 1d).

The time-of-day and the stage of P. falciparum sporogony differentially affected the locomotor activity of the vector (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1). In mosquitoes with parasites undergoing sporogony there was no effect of age post-blood meal on locomotion throughout the 24 h period in the absence of human odour (ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 1.71 p = 0.18; ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 0.31 p = 0.57; ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 3.49 p = 0.06 Supplementary Table 2) except during photophase in which salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) mosquitoes demonstrated lower activity than midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) individuals (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 21.97 p < 0.001). However in the presence of human odour the salivary gland sporozoite-infectious cohort (14 dpi) was more active at dawn (ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 15.40 p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 1d) while being less active than the younger mosquitoes throughout the rest of the diurnal period (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 9.35 p = 0.002; ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 20.02 p < 0.001; ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 9.73 p = 0.001 Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 1b). While the continuous temporal activity analysis supports the overall GLMM statistical model and the overall finding of this experiment it also identified a discrepancy in which 14 dpi females appeared to be more active than 7 dpi females throughout scotophase (Supplementary Fig. 1bd).

Individual locomotor profiles of mosquitoes at 7 dpi and 14 dpi differed significantly from that of age-matched uninfected controls (Fig. 1d). Infection significantly reduced the locomotor activity in 7 dpi females in the absence of human odour when compared with their uninfected counterparts during most time periods (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 8.49 p = 0.03; ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 1.008 p = 0.31; ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 7.84 p = 0.005; ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 13.78 p < 0.001 Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 1a). Mosquitoes carrying the transmissible stage of the parasite (14 dpi) displayed a lower locomotor activity than the uninfected counterparts throughout photophase and scotophase (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 5.92 p = 0.01; ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 11.87 p < 0.001 Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 1c) but not at dusk and dawn (ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 2.68 p = 0.10; ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 2.20 p = 0.10; Supplementary Fig. 1c). In the presence of human odour the midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) females showed lower activity than age-matched controls at dawn (ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 7.29 p = 0.006 Supplementary Fig. 1b) while the inverse activity pattern was observed during photophase (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 12.28 p = 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 1b). The salivary gland sporozoite-infectious mosquitoes (14 dpi) exhibited a significantly increased locomotor activity at dawn (ZT 23–24: χ2 1 = 23.78 p < 0.001) and during scotophase (ZT 12–23: χ2 1 = 25.42 p = 0.001) while there was no difference in activity of the salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) and uninfected females during photophase (ZT 0–11: χ2 1 = 2.26 p = 0.13) with a significant reduction in dusk (ZT 11–12: χ2 1 = 16.06 p < 0.001 Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 1d).

Plasmodium falciparum modulates antennal transcript abundance

Paired-end sequencing of each of the libraries constructed from antennal RNA with a total of 2400 antennae generated an average mapping of 26399740 million cleaned reads per library. Out of the 13832 coding genes annotated in the genome of An. gambiae (Agam4.10) a total of 10115 transcripts were reliably detected above 1 transcript per million (TPM) mapped reads in the antennae among all experimental and control groups demonstrating an adequate level of coverage.

A principal component analysis of the antennal transcripts was conducted to demonstrate the overall variation among the antennal transcriptomes (midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) and age-matched uninfected conditions; 4 replicates each; Fig. 2a). The principal component analysis identified that 49.8% of the variation among the libraries was based on the relative infection status in each age group (principal component 1; PC1) while 15.3% of the variance was dependent on age post-blood meal and infection status relative to the controls (PC2; Fig. 2a). All of the biological replicates of the same age and infection status clustered tightly together in the principal component space except for the salivary gland sporozoite-infectious samples (14 dpi) demonstrating that variation in the libraries due to handling and processing was successfully minimised. The separation of the four libraries of the 14 dpi samples into two clusters correlates with demonstrated differences in parasite load of the mosquitoes (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 3).

Principal component analysis (a) of the overall transcript abundance in the antennae of midgut oocyst-infected (7 days post-infection dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) mosquitoes compared to age-matched uninfected mosquitoes (7 days control dc and 14 dc).

Antennal transcripts were significantly differentially regulated between the two age-matched cohorts (6187) of which 3 465 were differentially abundant only between 14 dpi and 14 dc whereas in 7 dpi and 7 dc 850 were differentially abundant (Fig. 2b). In total 4807 transcripts were significantly differentially regulated between the two age-matched control groups and the two groups carrying P. falciparum parasites of which 1071 transcripts were shared between them (Fig. 2c). Within the age-matched control groups 2614 transcripts were uniquely regulated whereas 1122 were uniquely regulated within the two groups carrying P. falciparum parasites (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall differentially abundant transcripts were not condition-dependently regulated except those regulated post-infection during both the midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) stages (1872) of which more than 80% of the transcripts were down-regulated post-infection compared with the antennal transcripts of the uninfected age-matched post-blood meal females (Fig. 2b).

To characterise the functional ontology of the differentially abundant genes in the antennae of midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) mosquitoes with their age-matched controls a gene ontology (GO) analysis of molecular function (level three) was conducted (Fig. 3). Of the 3 685 differentially abundant transcripts between the two uninfected control groups the majority (> 75%) were functionally classified as structural constituent of cuticle (GO: 0042302) and enzyme inhibitor activity (GO: 0004857; Fig. 3a). Both of these classes were more abundant in older compared to the younger individuals. None of the age-dependent GO terms identified in the uninfected cohort comparison (Fig. 3a) were detected in the pairwise comparisons of the antennal transcriptomes among midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) and their age-matched controls. The three most represented functional classes in the pairwise comparisons between the midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) groups with their age-matched controls as well as between the midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) antennal transcriptomes were heterocyclic compound binding (GO: 1901363) organic cyclic compound binding (GO: 0097159) and ion binding (GO: 0043167; Fig. 3b). Two functional classes were regulated differently in the antenna of mosquitoes with a P. falciparum infection odorant binding (GO: 0005549) and carbohydrate derivative binding (GO:0097367). The number of genes in the functional class odorant binding were regulated in both midgut oocyst-infected (7 dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite-infectious (14 dpi) samples while those in the carbohydrate derivative binding class were differentially regulated only in infectious samples (Fig. 3b).

A level 3 gene ontology analysis of molecular function of Anopheles gambiae antennal transcriptomes comparing those of 13 and 19 days post-emergence females (7 days control dc and 14 dc respectively) (a) as well as those of 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) females along with age-matched controls (b). Gene ontology classes that were included comprised greater than 1% of the total number of differentially abundant genes identified. Those with less than 1% are grouped together in “other”.

A detailed analysis of the major chemosensory gene families associated with the odorant binding functional class Ors Irs Grs Csps and Obps was conducted. As the mosquitoes aged post-blood meal 34% of the chemosensory genes were significantly regulated in the antennae of uninfected females with chemosensory receptors demonstrating higher abundance in the older females while the binding proteins were both up- and down-regulated (Fig. 4). Following P. falciparum infection the abundance of 18 Obps reduced with age post-blood meal while only one chemosensory gene Ir41a demonstrated an increased abundance in the antennae of older females (Fig. 4). The differential abundance of these 18 Obps along with three others appear to be a result of an increased abundance at 7 dpi compared to the age-matched controls. The other chemosensory gene that was regulated at this age Ir7u was down-regulated upon infection.

Figure 4 Antennal chemosensory transcript abundance in female Anopheles gambiae is affected by Plasmodium falciparum infection stage. Chemosensory transcripts demonstrating reliable expression (> 1 TPM) in the antennae of midgut oocyst-infected (7 days post-infection; dpi) and salivary gland sporozoite - infectious (14 dpi) female mosquitoes along with their age-matched controls (7 days control; 7dc and 14 dc) were analysed in pairwise comparisons displayed as log 2 fold change in abundance. Chemosensory genes are arranged into gene families odorant binding proteins (OBPs) chemosensory proteins (CSPs) odorant receptors (Ors) ionotropic receptors (Irs) and gustatory receptors (Grs) in descending order of abundance (grey gradient bar log 10 TPM). Significant differences in abundance (fold change > 2; FDR-corrected p < 0.05) are indicated by black dots. Full size image

The post-blood meal age-dependent regulation of chemosensory genes was affected following P. falciparum infection as 73% of those genes that were up-regulated with age (Fig. 4 column 1) were shown not to increase in abundance post-infection (Fig. 4 columns 2 and 3) resulting in a higher abundance of these transcripts in the controls compared with those at 14 dpi (Fig. 4 column 4). The only exception to this was Ir7u which was down-regulated at 7 dpi exacerbating the decreased abundance observed at 14 dpi. Interestingly when the 7 dpi mosquitoes were compared to 14 dpi the abundance of the above-mentioned Obps were reversed returning to pre-infection levels (Fig. 4 column 2).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMi0wNTM2Ni040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Androgen deprivation restores ARHGEF2 to promote neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer | Cell Death ...,"RNA-seq and pathway analysis

To examine the direct effect of AR signaling on gene transcription the cells were perfused with charcoal-dextran stripped fetal bovine serum (CD-FBS) for 3 days and then treated with 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or DMSO for 24 h. Deep sequencing of rRNA-depleted total RNAs was performed in biological duplicates on LNCaP cells. To examine the biological effect of ARHGEF2 in PCa cells 22RV1 cells were transfected with siARHGEF2 (#1 and #2) and SCRAMBLE siRNAs for 48 h. RNA high throughput sequencing was performed by Cloud-Seq Biotech (Shanghai China). Briefly total RNA of each sample was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA of each sample was quantified and qualified by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Palo Alto CA USA) NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 1% agrose gel. 1 μg total RNA with RIN value above 6.5 was used for the following library preparation. The poly(A) mRNA isolation was performed using Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module or rRNA removal Kit. Next generation sequencing library preparations were constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA libraries were constructed by using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs Inc. Massachusetts USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were controlled for quality and quantified using the BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies Inc. USA). Library sequencing was performed on an illumina Novaseq 6000 instrument with 150 bp paired-end reads. After 3′ adaptor-trimming and low-quality read removing by cutadapt software (v1.9.3) the high-quality clean reads were aligned to the reference genome (UCSC hg19) with hisat2 software (v2.0.4). Then HTSeq software (v0.9.1) was used to get the raw count and the edgeR (v3.32.1) Bioconductor package was used to perform normalization then differentially expressed mRNAs were identified by p-value and fold change. 189 genes were downregulated in 22RV1 siARHGEF2 cells (Fold Change cut-off: 2.0; P-value cut-off: 0.05) which were further analyzed for enriched pathways. Pathway analysis is a functional analysis mapping gene to KEGG pathways. The Fisher p-value denotes the significance of the pathway correlated to the condition that was enriched (P-value cut-off is 0.05.) GSEA analysis was performed in the 22RV1 siARHGEF2 and 22RV1 si-NC groups to explore the biological signaling pathway [28]. The MAPK_Pathway with significant enrichment results was demonstrated on the basis of enrichment score (ES) and p-value.

Human prostate cancer specimens

Tissue microarrays (TMA) for prostate cancer (PCa) specimens were obtained from the second hospital of Tianjin Medical University acquiring the due consent from the patients and mandatory approval from the Institutional Review Board as described previously [29].

Animal model

TRAMP (Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate) [C57BL/6] mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories repository. Mouse-tail DNA was collected from the litter and subjected to PCR as described previously [30]. Whole murine prostates were micro-dissected from mice at the indicated age imaged weighed and then fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Sections were then transferred to 70% EtOH solution and paraffin embedded and sectioned.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining

IHC for AR (ab9474 Abcam) FGFR1 (9740 CST) P-ERK (4370 CST) SOX2 (3579 CST) CHGA (ab45179 Abcam) SYP (ab52636 Abcam) and ARHGEF2 (ab155785 Abcam) was performed using PV-6000 system (ZSGB-BIO China). Briefly the slides were immersed in 1X Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) buffer (Solarbio China) and placed in a microwave oven for 10 min on high heat and then adjusted to medium-low heat for 10 min to restore the antigen. 3% H 2 O 2 was added to remove endogenous peroxidase in tissue samples. Cover the tissue on the slide with the primary antibody place it in a humid box and incubate overnight at 4 °C. After rewarming at room temperature for 30 min horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO PV-6000 China) was added to the specimen and incubate the slides at room temperature for 30 min. After being stained with the DAB solution the slides were immediately placed in water to stop dyeing slides were subsequently counterstained with hematoxylin. The tissue is then dehydrated and preserved with neutral balsam (OriGene ZLI- 9555 China).

Immunostaining

Immunostaining was performed as described before [31]. Briefly cells were grown on cover glasses and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 10 min. Then cells were incubated with a blocking buffer (PBS with 5% BSA). Primary antibody was applied at the specified dilution in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The following morning cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (in blocking solution) for 30 min in the dark. Coverslips were then washed three times with PBS mounted with DAPI and examined under Olympus FV1000D microscope. The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: ARHGEF2 (ab201687 Abcam) CHGA (ab45179 Abcam) and AR (ab133273 Abcam).

Cell lines

All the prostate cancer (22RV1 LNCaP PC3 and DU145) cell lines were obtained from American Type Cell Culture (ATCC) and maintained as per guidelines. Briefly cells were cultured in the recommended media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) and 0.5% Penicillin Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in cell culture incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplied with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. LNCaP-AI was generated as described before and cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped serum (CD-FBS; Gibco) [29]. For certain experiments different cell lines were used based on their characteristics and potential significance. Briefly the LNCaP cell line is an AR positive and androgen sensitive human PCa cell [32 33]. The LNCaP-AI cell line is an AR positive and androgen independent human PCa cell generated from LNCaP cells [29]. PC3 and DU145 cell lines are negative for AR expression and show androgen-independent responses [32 34 35]. 22Rv1 cells harbor the H874Y mutation in the AR and are resistant to castration [32 36].

Androgen stimulation and deprivation

For androgen stimulation cells were starved for 72 h in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% CD-FBS (Gibco) followed by stimulation with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Sigma-Aldrich) at the indicated time points and indicated concentrations. For anti-androgen treatment LNCaP and 22RV1 cells were hormone-starved for 48 h using RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% CD-FBS (Gibco) followed by treatment with enzalutamide (cat. HY-70002 MedChem Express) for 48 h in complete medium.

Transfections

Transfections with siRNAs (purchased from GenePharma China) were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific USA) with cells at 50% confluence cultured in 6-well plates. The siRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. To achieve the maximal inhibition effect two siRNAs were mixed together and transfected into cells. LNCaP-AI and 22RV1-shARHGEF2 cells were generated using lentiviral shRNA against ARHGEF2 or SCRAMBLE (SWS Biotechnology Tianjin China). Overexpression of ARHGEF2 was generated using lentiviral mediated vector (SWS Biotechnology Tianjin China) and empty vector was used as control. After infection cells were selected with puromycin (1 ug/ml) for 3 days to remove uninfected cells and then maintained in puromycin-containing complete medium.

RNA analysis

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen USA) as the standard RNA isolation procedure. About 5 μg of total RNA with oligo (dT) primers was reverse-transcribed in a 20 μL volume using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) followed by the manufacturer’s protocol. For regular PCR all reactions were set up as follows: 10 µl 2× Taq PCR MasterMix (with dye) 0.4 µl forward primer (10 nM) 0.4 µl reverse primer (10 nM) 1 µl cDNA and 8.2 µl ddH 2 O for a total reaction volume of 20 µl. The reaction system was preheated at 94 °C for 3 min and then performed using the following thermal cycle program: 94 °C for 30 s 55 °C for 30 s 72 °C for 30 s and 40 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min. DNA products were analyzed in 1% agarose gel. For quantitative PCR all reactions were set up as follows: 10 µl FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche) 0.2 µl forward primer (10 nM) 0.2 µl reverse primer (10 nM) 1 µl cDNA and 8.6 µl ddH 2 O for a total reaction volume of 20 µl. The reaction system was preheated at 95 °C for 10 min and then performed using the following thermal cycle program: 95 °C for 15 s 72 °C for 20 s and 40 cycles. Relative expression of target genes was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method using GAPDH as an internal control. The primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Immunoblot analysis

Cell lysates were prepared in cell lysis buffer (Cat.R0020 Solarbio) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford (Pierce Bradford Assay Kit Thermo Scientific) at 595 nm. Western blot analysis was performed by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Briefly 50 µg proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore USA). The membrane was blocked with 5% non−fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. Subsequently blots were washed in 1× tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) buffer and incubated with secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) HRP conjugate cat. SA00001-1; Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) HRP conjugate cat. SA00001-2 Proteintech) for 1 h washed and processed using the Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Millipore) then visualized by Tanon (model 4500 Tanon) system. The primary antibodies used are as follow: 1:1000 diluted ARHGEF2 (Abcam cat. ab155785) 1:1000 diluted p44/42 MAPK (ERK) (CST cat. 9102) 1:1000 diluted phospho-p44/42 MAPK (P-ERK) (Thr202/Tyr204) (CST cat. 9101) 1:2000 diluted AR (Abcam cat. Ab133273) 1:1000 diluted KLK3 (CST cat. 5365) 1:2000 diluted CHGA (Abcam cat. ab45179) 1:2000 diluted SYP (Abcam cat. ab52636) 1:1000 diluted SOX2 (CST cat. 3579) 1:1000 diluted FGFR1 (CST cat.9740) and 1:5000 diluted GAPDH (Abcam cat. ab8245).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and ChIP-qPCR

ChIP was performed by EZ-Magna ChIP™ A/G kit (Catalog: 17-10086; Millipore) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly 1 × 107 cells were cross-linked with 37% formaldehyde (Catalog: F8775; Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min. Nuclei were extracted with Nuclear Lysis Buffer and cross-linked DNA was sheared to 200–1000 base pairs using SONICS Vibra-Cell™ Ultrasonic Liquid Processors (model VCX130; Sonics & Materials Inc.). Antibody for ChIP assays was purchased from Millipore (AR rat cat. 17-10489). ChIP-qPCR was performed with the following parameters: Initial Denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of Denature at 94 °C for 20 s and Anneal and Extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Primers for ChIP-qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

CUT & Tag (Cleavage under targets and tagmentation)

The CUT and Tag assay (CUT & Tag also referred to as “ChIP-seq”) was performed to determine the AR binding sites in LNCaP cells upon DHT treatment within 24 h. The detailed step-by-step protocol was followed by Steven Henikoff protocol at https://www.protocols.io/view/bench-top-cut-amp-tag-bcuhiwt6. Briefly cells were harvested counted and centrifuged for 3 min at 600 × g at room temperature washed twice in 1.5 mL Wash Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM Spermidine; 1× Protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated with activated concanavalin A coated magnetic beads (Bangs Laboratories) at RT for 15 min. Then the bead-bound cells were resuspended in 50–100 µL Dig-wash Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM Spermidine; 1× Protease inhibitor cocktail; 0.05% Digitonin) containing 2 mM EDTA and incubated with 5 µL of the AR primary antibody (Millipore; cat. 17-10489) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with pA-Tn5 at RT for 1 h and resuspended in 50–100 µL Tagmentation buffer (10 mM MgCl2 in Dig-med Buffer) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 2.25 µL of 0.5 M EDTA 2.75 µL of 10% SDS and 0.5 µL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K was added to stop tagmentation with incubation at 55 °C for 30 min and then at 70 °C for 20 min to inactivate Proteinase K. Followed by DNA extraction library amplification post-PCR clean-up paired-end NovaSeq 6000 sequencing was performed. Trimmomatic (version 0.40) was used to remove adapters and low-quality reads. Quality distribution plots and base content distribution were generated by FASTQC (version 0.11.9). Before read-mapping clean reads were obtained from the raw reads by removing the adaptor sequences. The clean reads were then aligned to reference genome (hg38) sequences using the Burrows-Wheeler-Alignment Tool (bwa). The bam file generated by the unique mapped reads as an input file using macs2 (version 2.2.7.1) for peak calling with cutoff q-value < 0.05. The data have been deposited into the CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) of China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb) with accession number CNP0001628.

Plasmids and luciferase assay

The pGL3-ARHGEF2-PP (GEF-H1 PP) construct was obtained by cloning the ARHGEF2 proximal promoter (ARHGEF2-PP) from the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) and pGL3-ARHGEF2-DP (GEF-H1 DP) was generated by cloning the distal promoter of the ARHGEF2 gene in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The DNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4. 22RV1 cells were plated at 40–50% confluency in a 24-well plate and were transfected with pGL3-ARHGEF2-PP (500 ng) and pRL-TK vector (5 ng) using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent. For androgen stimulation the 22RV1 cells were serum starved for 48 h and stimulated with DHT at indicated concentrations for 24 h in RPMI1640 media containing 10% CD-FBS. For anti-androgen treatment 22RV1 cells were treated with enzalutamide (10 µM) for 24 h. After 24 h of transfection with luciferase constructs cells were harvested using the lysis buffer provided with the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol using GloMax Luminometer (Promega). For each sample firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.

Raw material prices have risen consistently over the last year which has made it difficult to produce and source many parts. The automotive and transportation industries are feeling the impact of the microchip shortage a critical component needed to build the semitrucks on the road and which are essential for keeping the supply chain moving. In response truck manufacturers have either slowed production or halted building altogether until they can get the supplies they need.

For the trucking and logistics industry this means that new truck and trailer orders are either being partially filled or they are being delayed until further notice. With the supply chain already facing multiple challenges like the driver shortage and port congestion this throws another wrench into the equation. Many companies are going the extra mile to repair trucks and trailers in their fleet to ensure their equipment is safe and road-ready for their customers.

However with the ongoing parts shortage fleet maintenance shops are struggling to keep up. With the continuation of parts and microchip shortages fleets have been forced to run vehicles past conventional life cycles. In this environment carriers must look at maintaining their vehicles well in advance to ensure their current fleet can withstand wear and tear while remaining in the best condition possible. By performing proactive repairs and anticipating parts shortages companies can boost their equipment’s life cycle and its overall efficiency despite macro challenges in the parts market.

Managing a large fleet

It’s not uncommon to see fleets have more trailers on hand than they do tractors. Sometimes those trailers have cargo onboard that can’t be unloaded right away so rather than sit around and wait for it to be unloaded drivers can drop one trailer pickup another and be on their way. This enables fleets to maximize driver utilization.

LTL fleets typically have trailer-to-tractor ratios above two to one. This allows them to ensure they have enough resources at the start of each day to move shipments. But it takes the shipper carrier and receiver all working together to effectively manage resources ensuring trailers get unloaded and loaded on time and providing visibility to each other.

LTL carriers also have to manage utilization carefully because they allow multiple shippers to share space on the same trailer. Technology can be one piece of the puzzle but fleet managers and terminal operators also keep meticulous maintenance records. They’re key to knowing when to bring tractors or trailers into the shop for maintenance and logging what work is completed.

The shop is also one of the most important operations for any fleet. It has to ensure it has the parts or the tools on hand to complete a repair. If it doesn’t the fleet manager might be able to direct that piece of equipment to another terminal where that shop is better equipped to handle a repair. The shop manager also has to coordinate well in advance and know what parts are most used or replaced most often ensure that the shop has enough stock and anticipate needs in advance of repairs.

It's truly a team effort to keep the shops stocked with parts and tools coordinate bringing trailers and tractors in for repairs and understand how much time the equipment will be offline all while ensuring the rest of the fleet remains operational.

Predictive maintenance and maximizing uptime

The manifests that both the technology and shop managers keep are extremely important when tracking utilization and maintenance needs. Nowadays there’s so much data available around how long a part can effectively run before it is most likely to break down that companies can use this information to perform maintenance before the part breaks. This style of preventative maintenance helps reduce the chances of costly breakdowns on the road which might cause an accident or require a tow truck for assistance adding more costs that impact revenue.

Whether replacing a worn tire or swapping a piece in the engine doing so while the truck or trailer completes a trip is more costly. Not only does the equipment need to be fixed but the downtime can delay the shipment. This might cause the driver to have to wait until the next day to complete the shipment which cuts into driver utilization or the carrier might be charged a late fee. In either scenario it cuts into the bottom line of the carrier.

If implemented and utilized correctly a predictive maintenance schedule can help fleets maximize uptime and avoid the massive repairs that happen when something goes wrong on the road. This isn’t to say that performing replacements/repairs before something breaks will work out perfectly. Fleets should always prepare for emergencies and be ready to adjust on the fly.

But as the part and equipment shortage marches on fleets should be doing everything in their power to get ahead of any issues. Maximizing tractor and trailer uptime only benefits companies in the long run as avoiding costly repairs on the road and increasing utilization improves the bottom line.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 largest companies headquartered in Ireland.

The third-largest island in Europe Ireland boasts a highly developed knowledge which is focused on financial services life sciences high-tech and agribusiness. Considered to be an open economy Ireland ranks top in the world for high-value foreign direct investment while in terms of GDP per capita it ranks 4th in lists compiled by the International Monetary Fund as well as the the World Bank. All of this is even more impressive considering the fact that after consistent growth for 23 years Ireland was badly affected by the global 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the Irish property bubble which resulted in the country entering a recession.

Ireland's economy finally rebounded in 2011 growing by 2.2% followed by 0.2% in 2012 before plunging into another crisis driven by the European sovereign-debt crisis before rebounding again. There have been accusations that Ireland's economic growth is distorted due to Ireland having favorable corporate tax regimes which has led to many major foreign companies merging with companies in Ireland and moving their headquarters to the company to take advantage of the aforesaid corporate tax regime. Mainly companies in the United States have decided to move their headquarters to Ireland starting with Accenture in 2009. To a lesser extent the United Kingdom also has had companies moving their headquarters to Ireland. This has also been dubbed as ""leprechaun economics"" by economists while a few multinationals including the Central Bank of Ireland have proposed alternative methods of calculation. These moves especially for companies in the United States have said to have reduced the effective tax rate on corporations from 30% to 20% while these corporations have highly artificially inflated the GDP of the country.

To determine the largest companies headquartered in Ireland we headed over to Forbes Global 2000 list for 2022 and filtered out companies in Ireland. We then ranked these companies based on revenue profits assets and market value as of 29th October 2022. We then assigned 30% weightage to revenue profits and market value assigning 10% weightage to assets. This has allowed us to create a more accurate ranking. Please keep in mind that you will find a lot of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on Nasdaq because of the fact that many companies in our list are American Irish companies. Some of the companies in our list are also among the biggest companies in Europe. So without further ado let's take a look at some Irish giants starting with number 15:

CHESAPEAKE Va. — Historically Black Colleges and Universities received half a million dollars in scholarship money and a commitment to hire recent graduates from Truist Bank.

The bank's Virginia president Thomas Ransom made the announcement at an event called “HBCU Sunday” hosted by The Mount church in Chesapeake.

“Our purpose at Truist is to inspire and build better lives in communities so we are deeply involved in all our communities"" Ransom said.

The annual event is a chance for local colleges to connect with the community and showcase their schools according to the church's bishop Kim Brown.

“This is our third time doing it"" Brown said. ""We suspending it during COVID so it’s our first time since COVID.”

College recruiters were on hand to speak with high school seniors and Truist bank management conducted onsite job interviews with college seniors.

Truist donated $250000 to Norfolk State University. The school's president Dr. Javaune Adams-Gaston said the money will be used for a women leadership program.

“When you come to a Norfolk State University when you come to an HBCU it’s home"" Dr. Adams-Gaston said. ""And you feel that connectivity. You feel like you don’t have to explain who you are.”

Virginia State University also received $250000. VSU president Dr. Makola Abdullah said the money will go towards an entrepreneur program.



“It’s excellent for our students to be able to get the opportunity to use these funds to do some fantastic things at the university so we’re very excited” Dr. Abdullah said.

College leaders say it’s an investment in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0a3IuY29tL25ld3MvY2hlc2FwZWFrZS1jaHVyY2gtc2hvd2Nhc2VzLWhiY3VzLW9uLWhiY3Utc3VuZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Chesapeake church showcases HBCUs on ""HBCU Sunday""","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.wtkr.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/chesapeake-church-showcases-hbcus-on-hbcu-sunday (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF31DEAD0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0a3IuY29tL25ld3MvY2hlc2FwZWFrZS1jaHVyY2gtc2hvd2Nhc2VzLWhiY3VzLW9uLWhiY3Utc3VuZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldm9sdC50di9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjItMTEtMDYvMjUxMDk0L2x1ZGFjcmlzLWNlbWVudHMtaGlzLW5hbWUtaW4tYXRsYW50YXMtbGVnYWN5LXdpdGgtaGlzLW5ldy1pY2VkLW91dC1ibGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ludacris cements his name in Atlanta's legacy with new bling,"Image Image Credit Getty Image Alt Ludacris

Ludacris’ love for the A is so real that the Atlanta Braves made him an honorary member of the team. To commemorate the moment the Fast & Furious actor showed off the baseball team’s gift to him — a World Series championship ring.

Last November the Braves defeated the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the World Series. The victory marked the team’s first championship win since 1995. In an Instagram video posted on Saturday (Nov. 5) Derek Schiller the team’s president and CEO presented Luda with the new bling at the Braves’ Cobb County stadium Truist Park. In a matrimony-inspired presentation Schiller asked the “Southern Hospitality” rapper if he was willing to wed the team through “sickness and in health through wins and losses more wins than losses.”

“It says Ludacris on there. I can’t believe this I’m shaking” joked Luda who finally exclaimed “Yes I do!” In another video the area code connoisseur showed off the ring as he joked that he was an official member of the team.

The ring — made of 18.71-karat white gold and 14-karat yellow gold — contains 755 diamonds 19 genuine rubies and one genuine pearl. Each ring includes the player’s signature as well as a host of other details including a miniature replica of Truist Park the franchise’s signature “A” and the team’s slogan. According to Forbes the ring cost roughly $25000.

Outkast’s Big Boi is another honorary recipient of the team’s championship ring. The Atlanta native and Ludacris both performed during the team’s World Series championship parade and celebration. “This is up there with winning Album of the Year the Grammy and performing at the Super Bowl. It’s the same thing” he said on the “Throwing Fits” podcast. “It’s for the city. The last time we won the World Series is when we first started [Outkast].”

Health 'Earn While You Learn' program grows and expands opportunities,"While the Earn While You Learn program began in the pharmaceuticals department of U.Va. Health it will expand to include technicians in sterile processing radiology nursing surgical scrub and paramedics.

The Earn While You Learn employment program at U.Va. Health is expanding its scope to include more opportunities for non-native English speaking participants as well as training for additional healthcare positions. First implemented in February the program provides an opportunity for members of the Charlottesville community to jumpstart a career in healthcare without a college degree or previous healthcare experience.

The program received a $50000 grant from the Truist Foundation in September to include opportunities for non-native English speakers. The Truist Foundation partners with nonprofit organizations like U.Va. Health to support excluded and underserved communities.

Beth Mehring head of the Earn While You Learn program said this development since February has been extremely fast-paced and has involved debunking myths about healthcare throughout the process as people often believe they need to have a lot of experience in healthcare or they do not think about applying to U.Va Health as a career option.

“In some ways we’re sort of building the airplane as we’re flying” Mehring said. “We’ve been learning about how we best meet the needs of the community and how we can best integrate into the [Charlottesville] community to help understand its needs.”

Currently the program includes training for pharmacy technicians emergency medical technicians certified nursing assistants phlebotomists and certified medical assistants. Over 40 program participants began training in the various programs this summer while the incoming fall classes include over 65 new trainees.

Abdulalkarim Awwad a participant in the pharmacy technician program and former CVS employee began his training this summer and explained the appeal of working for a system like U.Va. Health.

“U.Va. hospital is this huge educational place” Awwad said. “I couldn’t say no to it.”

Awwad’s experiences in healthcare at U.Va. Health have inspired him to return to school in the future to pursue a career as a physician’s assistant.

“The educational programs that they’ve put me into have been spectacular” Awwad said. “Working at a pharmacy especially working at U.Va. Hospital kind of made me realize how much I enjoy medicine.”

Awwad said that based on what he has learned from U.Va. Health and his interactions with other technicians he highly recommends the program to anyone considering a career in medicine even if pharmacy is not what they intend to do forever.

Veronica Desper U.Va. Outpatient Pharmacy technician manager said people who have not considered healthcare as their first choice of employment in the past have been attracted to the program as well increasing the overall number of applicants.

“It's attracting a lot of applicants” Desper said. “Just the increase in our applicant pool has been a win for sure.”

As a result of the increasing interest in the program Mehring and others involved in the program have been looking for ways to expand. The new Truist Foundation grant will allow them to put their ideas into action.

“Part of this grant will be used to help support outreach and marketing” Mehring said. “We want to keep people coming in and help share the opportunity.”

Planned expansions for the program include training technicians in sterile processing and surgical scrub  as well as training participants in radiology nursing and paramedics. The expansion also includes plans for those eventually working towards two-year degree programs such as respiratory therapy.

Mehring explained that key entry point roles outside of the program are also an important potential area of expansion. Entry roles in nutritional services and environmental services could aid non-English speaking participants in developing their language skills. After English language exposure in these roles participants could begin training in the Earn While You Learn program.

The other part of the grant will go towards building the program to help program candidates develop English as a second language. Piedmont Virginia Community College will collaborate with U.Va. Health to achieve this through its Network 2 Work program which assists in language development.

“We want to be able to not only get someone through the door but help them advance both written and verbal language so that they can advance their career once they get here” Mehring said.

Mehring said U.Va. Health recognizes that internationally relocated people such as refugees also need opportunities once they arrive in the area. She hopes that they will be able to benefit from the program and its constant expansions as well.

Both Mehring and Desper explained that the program not only benefits the U.Va. Health system and the community but also patients as stable staffing allows patients to be taken care of more efficiently.

“I think things are going to continue to evolve at a very rapid rate” Mehring said. “We are continuing to build relationships and it's been a great collective growth.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZ2VvcmdpYXN0YXRlc2lnbmFsLmNvbS93aGF0cy1uZXh0LWZvci10aGUtYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's Next for the Atlanta Braves? - The Signal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='georgiastatesignal.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /whats-next-for-the-atlanta-braves/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF31DFDF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZ2VvcmdpYXN0YXRlc2lnbmFsLmNvbS93aGF0cy1uZXh0LWZvci10aGUtYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

There have been 135 bank heists through Oct. 23 compared to 95 during the same period in 2021 according to the NYPD.

The TD Bank at the busy corner of East 57th and Third Avenue has been a magnet for bandits since March with the latest heist happening this month.

A serial thief wearing a blue baseball cap walked into the branch on Oct. 20 and handed over a note saying “This is a bank robbery I have a gun open the drawer and pass me the money.”

He did not display a weapon and fled with about $760 the NYPD said.

The same bearded robber is suspected in two of the other robberies at the branch as well as in 15 other heists in Queens and Manhattan at Chase Citi and Santander banks — walking away with a total of about $15000 police said.

Video from a May robbery at a Capital One branch in Queens shows the suspect who is wearing a baseball cap with “New York” on it and a zippered sweatshirt sauntering into the branch carrying a paper shopping bag but without a mask or other facial covering.

The brazen thief has struck several branches repeatedly.

He is alleged to have hit the East 57th Street TD branch on June 8 taking $520 and on Sept. 1. making off with $545 police said.

The branch was also robbed on March 21 when a different suspect made off with $1268 the NYPD said.

Serial thieves have been targeting several of the same areas. J.C.Rice

A customer at the targeted TD Bank said that she “wished” the news about all the heists “surprised me a bit more.”

“It does make me question more about what times I want to stop by or use the ATM or when I go in if it seems there’s enough people around although sometimes that doesn’t seem to be a deterrent” said the 28-year-old woman who gave her name only as Lizzie.

A security guard at the bank was alarmed by the repeated robberies.

“They’re beginning to not care” the guard said about the thieves. “It’s sad.”

Nationwide the number of bank robberies fell from 2440 in 2019 to 1724 in 2021. The nationwide peak came in 1991 with 9388 robberies.

A TD bank spokesman said “The safety of our customers and colleagues is a top priority. We have security measures in place and when robberies occur we work closely with law enforcement and offer programs to support impacted TD colleagues.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vYWR2aXNvci9kZWJ0LXJlbGllZi91LXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtZGVidC1zdXJwYXNzZXMtMzAtdHJpbGxpb24td2hhdC10aGlzLW1lYW5zLWZvci15b3Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. National Debt Tops $30 Trillion: Will Americans Feel the Impact? – Forbes Advisor,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/debt-relief/u-s-national-debt-surpasses-30-trillion-what-this-means-for-you/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vYWR2aXNvci9kZWJ0LXJlbGllZi91LXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtZGVidC1zdXJwYXNzZXMtMzAtdHJpbGxpb24td2hhdC10aGlzLW1lYW5zLWZvci15b3Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Many people in Mexico already have doubts about President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s Maya Train project. There are questions about its environmental impact and uncertain demand for the train service.

But López Obrador also faces a massive logistical challenge in his rush to finish the train within a year. Millions of tons of ballast are needed to stabilize rail ties but no suitable rock is available for hundreds of miles. Most of it has to be trucked in from the Gulf coast about 550 miles (900 km) away.

López Obrador said the crushed rock could be brought in more significant amounts by ship from Cuba but said he was aware that would spark criticism.

“I am going to say something so that our adversaries question us” López Obrador said. Pointing to a map of Cuba he said “It is very likely that for this stretch we will bring ballast from here.”

Even then the ships carrying Cuban ballast would have to land at the port of Sisal on the other side of the Yucatan peninsula and be trucked about 180 miles (300 km) to some train construction sites.

There is a private Caribbean coast freight dock at Playa del Carmen — right on the proposed rail line — that could handle the Cuban shipments but López Obrador can’t use that dock because he ordered that the U.S. company that owns it be closed down.

“That (port) would be ideal it is deep enough but relations are not good” with the company López Obrador acknowledged.

In May the Environment Department closed the limestone quarry owned by Alabama-based Vulcan Materials including the dock.

López Obrador wants the water-filled quarry to be used as a theme park to rival the nearby Xcaret park. He also wants Vulcan to build a cruise ship dock at the freight terminal. He has pressured the Alabama-based aggregates company to sell the property to the government or open a water park itself.

The water park idea is almost certainly a non-starter. The water-filled sections of the quarry while they look inviting are populated by crocodiles.

The 950-mile (1500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites.

López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s massive tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists will actually want to use the train.

Moreover with no prior environmental studies the president decided to cut down a swath of low jungle between the resorts of Cancun and Tulum.
