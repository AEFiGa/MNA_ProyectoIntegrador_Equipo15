The effort builds upon its anti-counterfeit efforts during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time a number of sellers claimed to offer 3M respirators. Instead many offered fake defective and damaged N95 masks at inflated prices.

St. Paul Minnesota-based 3M worked closely with law enforcement and governments around the world to stop counterfeit 3M respirators and COVID-19-related fraud. According to a news release the company seized more than 58 million counterfeit respirators. It removed tens of thousands of fraudulent e-commerce offerings and suing wrongdoers to stop misleading schemes targeting frontline workers.

3M said the platform expands its counterfeit reporting process to include all products made by the company. The platform can be found HERE. It offers resources and information to help customers distributors employees and the general public avoid purchasing counterfeit 3M products.

Verify also allows customers to contact 3M to report potential counterfeit products. Reports of suspected counterfeit 3M products will be reviewed and investigated by anti-counterfeit response teams globally the company said.

“At 3M we are focused on innovating for our customers and that includes our commitment to fight counterfeiting and fraud” said Kevin Rhodes 3M EVP and chief legal affairs officer. “The 3M Verify platform will enable all our customers to be confident their product is genuine and delivering the quality that 3M is known for around the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dHNpZGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLWpvdXJuYWwvYnJhbmRzL3dvbHZlcmluZS13b3JsZHdpZGUtM20tdG8tcGF5LTU0LW1pbGxpb24tcG9sbHV0aW9uLWxhd3N1aXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wolverine Worldwide and 3M to Pay $54 Million in Pollution Lawsuit,"Heading out the door? Read this article on the Outside app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app .

Michigan-based Wolverine Worldwide Inc.–owner of Merrell Saucony and Chaco–and Scotchgard water repellent manufacturer 3M have agreed to pay $54 million in a class-action settlement to 1700 residents of Kent County Michigan in connection with the disposal of chemicals that impacted the drinking water of area property owners.

The settlement has been tentatively approved by U.S. District Judge Hala Jarbou who called it “fair reasonable adequate and meets the standards for preliminary approval.” A final hearing will take place on March 29 2023.

Wolverine and 3M were taken to court in a 2017 for allegedly contaminating Kent County groundwater with chemicals containing PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) more than 50 years ago. In 1958 a Wolverine tannery in Rockford Michigan began manufacturing shoe leather with a 3M Scotchgard treatment containing PFAS—substances sometimes used as a water-resistant agent in outdoor products that have come under fire in recent years as “forever chemicals” that don’t break down and may increase cancer risk. Waste from Wolverine’s manufacturing process was released in the nearby House Street Disposal Area where litigants claim it seeped into the groundwater.

The House Street site stopped receiving waste from the company in 1970 and Wolverine today uses a different waterproofing agent—without PFAS—in its manufacturing process.

This settlement is only the latest development stemming from Wolverine’s industrial pollution in Michigan. In 2019 the company made a $69.5 million deal with the state of Michigan and the townships of Plainfield and Algoma to extend water lines to properties whose wells were contaminated by the disposal of PFAS. Of that sum $55 million was paid by 3M. Wolverine also agreed to maintain water filters for homes not on a public water system as part of that deal.

Neither Wolverine nor 3M has disclosed how much each company will pay of the $54 million settlement. In a statement Wolverine said the settlement is in line with “doing the right thing for our community.”

Publicly traded Wolverine Worldwide Inc. (NYSE: WWW) is valued at more than $1.3 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbGlndXkuY29tL2Jsb2dzL3Bvc3RzL2RqaS1tYXZpYy0zLXZzLW1hdmljLTMtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS12cy1tYXZpYy0zLXRoZXJtYWwtdnMtbWF2aWMtMy1tdWx0aXNwZWN0cmFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DJI Mavic 3 Series vs Mavic 3 Enterprise Series – heliguy™,"Comparison between the DJI Mavic 3 Series (Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 Classic) and the Mavic 3 Enterprise Series (Mavic 3E Mavic 3T and Mavic 3M);

DJI Mavic 3 vs Mavic 3 Cine vs Mavic 3 Classic vs Mavic 3 Enterprise vs Mavic 3 Thermal vs Mavic 3 Multispectral: In-depth Comparison

So that's the overview.

Now it's time to dig a bit deeper into the capabilities of each drone.

DJI Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 Classic: The Filmmaking Drone

The DJI Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine (released November 2021) as well as the Mavic 3 Classic (released November 2022) are next-generation content creation drones packing highly-impressive imaging capabilities into a foldable lightweight (Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Classic: 895 g; Mavic 3 Cine: 899 g) frame. Their imaging specs also make them suitable for visual inspection.

This trio of Mavic 3 drones benefit from a 4/3 CMOS 20MP Hasselblad camera and have the ability to shoot 5.1K/50fps video and epic 4K/120fps slow-motion.

The Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine also have a 1/2-inch CMOS 12MP Tele camera capable of achieving 28x hybrid zoom. The Mavic 3 Classic does not feature the Tele camera and has 3x digital zoom via its single Hasselblad sensor.

Engineered for quality content creation the Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 Classic have a suite of functions and features such as 12.8 stops of Native Dynamic Range; Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution (HNCS) to deliver vivid natural colours; 10-bit D-Log to deliver natural colour gradations; HLG for higher dynamic range; Vision Detection Auto Focus Technology; and night shots video to optimise footage in low-light scenarios.

To take content creation to another level the Mavic 3 Cine uses Apple ProRes 422 HQ Codec - the industry standard for high-quality video and one of the best practical HD formats available for cinematography.

To complement this the Cine has an internal 1TB SSD to cater for these larger Apple ProRes files. A microSD card can also be inserted for additional capacity.

The standard Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Classic have 8GB of onboard storage plus capacity for a microSD card. They do not use Apple ProRes instead utilising MP4/MOV (MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 HEVC/H.265).

To read more about the differences between the Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 Classic read our comparison blog.

All three drones are compatible with numerous DJI controllers namely the DJI RC Pro and DJI RC - both smart controllers with built-in screens - as well as the RC-N1. Read our in-depth comparison guide to find out more about these controllers.

Use the Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 Classic with the DJI Fly app.

The Mavic 3 Series have a maximum flight time of 46 minutes and a wealth of advanced flight safety features such as omnidirectional object sensing Advanced Return To Home and APAS 5.0.

DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise: The Surveying Drone

The DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise is engineered for GCP-free centimetre-accurate aerial surveying and precise visual inspection.

Like the Mavic 3 Series the Mavic 3 Enterprise has a 4/3-inch CMOS 20MP wide camera. It also has a 1/2-inch CMOS 12MP Tele camera.

But the aircraft's imaging capabilities are tweaked to optimise it for surveying.

For instance it is the only Mavic 3 aircraft to have mechanical and electronic shutters: The others only have electronic. The addition of the mechanical shutter ensures no jelly effect under high-speed movement which is essential for a reliable surveying drone.

The Mavic 3 Enterprise also benefits from a shutter speed of 0.7s compared to the Mavic 3's 2.5s. This shorter shooting interval coupled with the M3E's 45 minutes of flight time (or 42 minutes with RTK Module) makes it a highly-efficient surveying solution.

For instance with a GSD of 5cm the orthophoto efficiency of the Mavic 3E can reach 2.25 square kilometres in a single flight.

Its Intelligent Low-Light Mode also offers significantly improved performance in dim conditions.

Unlike the Mavic 3 Series the Mavic 3 Enterprise can carry accessories such as a loud speaker. Although it's fair to say that the most important accessory for the Mavic 3E is its RTK module which supports TimeSync for GCP-free centimeter-level surveying.

To further benefit surveying missions the Mavic 3 Enterprise is compatible with route planning within DJI Pilot 2 such as waypoint mapping oblique and linear and is compatible with DJI Terra.

The Mavic 3 Enterprise can also be used with DJI FlightHub 2 and is compatible with the new smart controller the DJI RC Pro Enterprise with 1000 nit high-brightness screen.

Like the Mavic 3 Series the Mavic 3 Enterprise series features omnidirectional obstacle sensing Advanced Return To Home and APAS 5.0.

DJI Mavic 3 Thermal: The Public Safety And Inspection Drone

The DJI Mavic 3T is built with public safety search and rescue inspection and thermal mapping in mind.

As its name suggests the key differentiator is the addition of its 640 x 512 @ 30 Hz radiometric thermal sensor.

Combine this with the drone's Tele camera which helps it achieve 56x hybrid zoom and you have an aircraft which is a powerful lightweight and portable tool for law enforcement looking for missing people or spotting abnormalities/defects during inspections.

Admittedly the visual (wide) sensor - 48MP 1/2-inch CMOS - is not as strong as the wide sensor on the Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine Mavic 3 Classic or Mavic 3 Enterprise but it packs enough capability to provide operators with visual data to make informed decisions and provide vital situational awareness.

With its 45 minutes of flight time the aircraft has decent endurance to capture mission-critical data.

Like the Mavic 3 Enterprise the M3T can carry additional accessories such as the RTK module (which improves georeferencing accuracy but not to the level of the Mavic 3 Enterprise) and a loud speaker which can be a crucial tool during certain emergency scenarios. Incidentally the DJI RC Pro Enterprise controller has a built-in speaker which can be used with the speaker accessory.

The M3T can be used with DJI FlightHub 2. Especially suited to public safety and search and rescue teams this all-in-one cloud-based software is a vital tool for enhanced situational awareness and real-time team collaboration.

A highly-capable and reliable drone the M3T has omnidirectional object sensing APAS 5.0 and Advanced Return To Home.

DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral: The Agricultural Drone

The DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral is engineered for agriculture land management and environmental monitoring. It is a revamped farming drone to supersede DJI's older multispectral platform the Phantom 4 Multispectral. Find out how the two compare in our Mavic 3M vs P4M comparison blog.

The Mavic 3M has a newly-upgraded imaging system with one 20MP RGB camera and four 5MP multispectral cameras (green red red edge and near infrared). In fact the aircraft features the smallest 4-band multispectral camera in the world.

The drone's camera array enables applications such as high-precision aerial surveying crop growth monitoring and natural resource surveys.

To further aid agricultural applications the Mavic 3M features a sunlight sensor for more consistent data; is compatible with an RTK Module (comes with the aircraft) to enable highly-accurate mapping without ground control points; performs Smart Terrain Follow to maintain an even altitude as you fly a survey mission across varying terrain; and can conduct automatic field scouting.

The Mavic 3M is also compatible with DJI Terra (to create maps and models) as well as the DJI SmartFarm app which allows agricultural professionals to coordinate any data gathered with spraying and spreading operations.

DJI Mavic 3 vs Mavic 3 Cine vs Mavic 3 Classic vs Mavic 3 Enterprise vs Mavic 3 Thermal vs Mavic 3 Multispectral: Summary

The DJI Mavic is iconic and the DJI Mavic 3 range builds on and innovates upon previous iterations of the popular Mavic family.

Now there are six Mavic 3 drones in the mix: The Mavic 3 Mavic 3 Cine Mavic 3 Classic Mavic 3 Enterprise Mavic 3 Thermal and Mavic 3 Multispectral.

Based on their specifications and characteristics each one has its own target audience whether that's content creation surveying public safety inspection thermal mapping agriculture or land management.

And for operators looking for a lightweight portable and dependable solution the Mavic 3 range certainly covers all bases.

LYNDA RAE SANDERS

Lynda Rae Sanders Young passed from the Earth on Monday September 19 2022. She was born on October 30 1938 and was 83 at her death.

Lynda's parents were John Abraham ""Jack"" Sanders and Avis Bridges Sanders.

Jack married and had a family before he met Avis. His children from this union were Nina Sanders Bridges Sadie Sanders Rudd Evah Virginia Sanders McCready and William McKinley ""Cap"" Sanders. All of these half-siblings predeceased Lynda. Jack and Avis had these children: James B. Sanders Floyd Sanders Lloyd Sanders Ola Mae Sanders Mayfield and Lynda. Floyd and Lloyd remain with us and are greatly saddened at their sister's passing. After Jack's death Avis married Chris Phillips. This union produced Robert Phillips and Richard Phillips. Richard remains with us and mourns the loss of his sister.

Lynda was born on the family farm. It was near Frog Level. Her understanding was that her father donated the land for Barlow Cemetery.

When Lynda was four her family moved to the Red Road community north of Lamartine. It was there that she grew to adulthood. She married Richard Arnold ""Buck"" Young when she was 18. Buck died in 2009. Lynda was an extraordinary person. She possessed a strong intellect and used this gift to great effect throughout her life. She worked in various roles before landing a job with Arkansas Power and Light around 1980. She worked at the Harvey Couch Power Plant in Stamps. She was the first woman to work alongside the men at the plant. She remained at Couch for many years. During her employment she became licensed to operate the steam-powered turbine at the plant.

Lynda also was known for her carpentry skills (although the word ""carpentry"" falls far short of encompassing all that she could do). For example in the mid-70s she built a large living room onto the front of her house in Lamartine. Starting from the slab she began with the framing and ended with the roofing wiring exterior painting and interior finish work. She did it all herself. Over the course of her life she undertook and completed dozens of carpentry projects for both herself and family members.

Lynda was a loving and supportive mother to her two surviving children and their offspring. It is no exaggeration to say that her support was instrumental in her children's success in life. She certainly would have played the same role for Hazel Denise Young her first child had Denise survived. Sadly Denise died in May of 1957 after only two days of life.

Lynda is survived by a large and loving family. Her children are Tracy and Brad. Her grandchildren through Tracy are Jared Roberson (married to Kristin) and Brent Roberson (married to Gina). Her grandchildren through Brad are Kyle and Savannah (engaged to John Hernandez). Lynda's great-grandchildren through Jared are Carter Carlee and Blaine; through Jared she also enjoyed her role as step-great-grandmother to Colton Ellis. Lynda's great grandchildren through Brent are Bryce Kase Morgan and Taylor. And a special family member Ronald Munn. He wasn't blood but she loved him dearly and he did her. He was at her beck and call the last 18 plus years and would do anything for her. She loved him like a son.

Visitation at Lewis Funeral Home in Magnolia will be from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday September 23. A memorial service will occur at 10 a.m. on Saturday September 24 in the chapel at Lewis Funeral Home with burial afterwards at Columbia Cemetery in Lamartine. Pallbearers will be Rollie Flaherty David Aldridge Wendall Hart Terry Collum Dicky Hartsfield and Tommy Cloud.

They share two beloved daughters Dennise Fuller Franklin and Ginger Fuller Braun and husband Chris Braun and his parents-in-law David and Evelyn Bright. Dennis is also survived by his big sister and lifelong best friend Judy Fuller Willcox. His world revolved around being a doting and fun grandfather to Carson and Cameron Braun and Carlee and Kayleigh Franklin. Dennis was also surrounded in life by several adoring nieces and nephews and countless friends.

As a star track runner for Stamps High School Dennis possessed an innate love for athletics. He was a passionate Razorbacks fan and enthusiastically supported the Muleriders at SAU games. When he wasn't cheering on his teams and grandkids he was managing the insurance agency he'd built with his number one teammate Jeannie. Den and Jeannie were devoted to going above and beyond meeting the needs of their clients who so often became their dear friends. They valued their opportunities to help others which always spurred him to work even harder. To further demonstrate God's love Dennis served as the President of his Sunday School Class at First United Methodist Church in Magnolia Arkansas. He loved fostering an environment of learning enjoyed growing his relationship with the Lord and heartily appreciated his church family.

Dennis's kind heart was only barely eclipsed by his sense of humor. He was the life of the party and if it wasn't officially a party he made it one! He was merrily mischievous and constantly made people belly laugh at his tall but true tales. We are grateful for our time here with Dennis Larry Fuller and can only imagine the glorious time he and God are having together now.

Pallbearers for Dennis will be Kim Reeves Charley Bright Mike Rowe Dr. Joe Bussell John Michael Haynes and Randy Pearson. Honorary pallbearers will be Chris Braun his son-in-law; David Ray Bright his brother-in-law; Christopher R. Willcox his nephew; and Don Davis his friend.

Peanut butter and jelly. Thunder and lightning.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1).

It’s a mouthful of a word pair but it’s a unique one that opens the door to understanding concussion sometimes called a mild traumatic brain injury or mTBI. From bumps to blows to jolts to the head GFAP and UCH-L1 are a reliable pair of biomarkers released into the bloodstream after a brain injury. From a broad perspective biomarkers are characteristics of the body that are measurable like blood pressure or amounts of a protein in the blood and they help assess our health.

Let's take a closer look at how this invisible couple impacts concussion assessment.

A Biomarkers Analogy

If you show up to the emergency room hand on your heart and complaining of chest pain you're likely getting a blood test. The test you receive will look at the levels for a protein called Troponin-I which appears more in the blood after a heart attack. Healthcare professionals have had blood tests for the heart liver and kidneys for some time but not one for the brain. When looked at together the GFAP and UCH-L1 biomarkers open the window to understanding concussions.

Exploring the use of biomarkers to better understand what is going on in the body began with the link between troponin and suspected heart attack. Although it took years for troponin to be officially adopted as the standard of care it did occur in 2007 – and the same could happen for GFAP and UCH-L1 for traumatic brain injuries in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cm9qYW4uY29tL2EtYW5kLWUvMjAyMi8wOS8yOC9hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS1pcy1leGFjdGx5LXdoYXQtdHYtd2FzLW1pc3Npbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comic Relief: ‘Abbott Elementary’ is exactly what TV was missing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cm9qYW4uY29tL2EtYW5kLWUvMjAyMi8wOS8yOC9hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS1pcy1leGFjdGx5LXdoYXQtdHYtd2FzLW1pc3Npbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001AFD75BA710>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In Wednesday’s episode of ABC's hit sitcom “Abbott Elementary” (9 EDT/PDT) which returned for Season 2 last week Janelle James’ inept Principal Ava hosts a “Shark Tank”-style competition for teachers to win grant money. Her fellow “shark” is none other than pint-sized terror Courtney (Lela Hoffmeister) a student whom Ava considers both a protégé and nemesis.

“Competing with a kid is very Ava” James says. ""That tiny actress is super cute and professional. We have a picture of us together in character and we do look like peas in a pod. We have the same type of mischievous smile which I didn't realize until I took this role. Every time I smile I look like I'm up to something.""

'Abbott Elementary' sparks fan fervor:Quinta Brunson talks ABC comedy

Unbothered and unfiltered Principal Ava quickly became the most quoted ""Abbott"" character during the show’s breakout first season thanks in part to her ruthless put-downs and trend-chasing schemes. (“I’ve done everything I possibly can to make my phone think I’m 22. I haven’t used capital letters in years” she says.)

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

It's James' first major TV role after stints acting on HBO's ""Crashing"" and writing for Showtime's ""Black Monday"" and BET's ""The Rundown with Robin Thede."" Born in the Virgin Islands she went to school for fashion design before discovering stand-up and has since toured with Chris Rock and Amy Schumer.

'This is what believing looks like':Sheryl Lee Ralph schools Emmys with 'Abbott Elementary' win

""Abbott"" won three Emmy Awards this month including outstanding comedy writing (by creator and star Quinta Brunson) and best comedy supporting actress (Sheryl Lee Ralph). James who was also nominated for an Emmy talks to USA TODAY about the new season and why we all really love Ava.

Question: What do you remember about having Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty on set for the Season 2 premiere?

Answer: I don't follow sports much less hockey so I only kind of knew him. We met the person inside first and then he put on the costume so that was like a separation. You never meet the guy in the costume you know? He was a super chill regular guy. And he's way bigger than I thought he would be – Gritty not the guy. (Laughs.) He was coming down the hallway and it was kind of a nightmare scenario if you don't know what's happening.

My favorite line from the episode was Ava bragging that she had a hookah flavor named after her. (“Ava-lade: Notes of malt liquor and marmalade."") What inspired that joke?

Over the summer a couple people made specialty Ava Coleman drinks and I think the idea came from that. A lot of bartenders were tagging me and the show saying they've made signature Ava drinks. I think one of them had Kahlúa? I'm not a big drinker so I wouldn't know. But some of them were really fancy with smoke coming out of them.

Which Ava one-liner do people quote back to you the most?

Oh ""Let me back my tasty *** up"" which makes me happy because it was my first improv line. A lot of the stuff comes to us already funny on paper so I don't improv a lot. I mean I feel like everything I say is funny. (Laughs.) I'm not on screen that much so when I do come in I gotta hit. That's my thinking and it's the same thinking that I take from stand-up which is my background.

One of my favorite jokes – which I think people don't catch until (they) rewatch – is ""Damn last time I was up this early was to cuss out the mailman. Don't need all those bills coming."" It's just so random and out of nowhere like ""What is she talking about?"" Those are the kinds of jokes I like.

Why do you think Ava has become such a fan favorite?

No. 1 she's hilarious. No. 2 she represents a real person. Everyone has worked with a boss like this at some point. And No. 3 I think people all secretly want to be a narcissistic layabout you know what I mean? (Laughs.) Like ""Oh that person says what she's thinking all the time. Don't we all wish we could say and do that? Especially in the workplace I could just tell everybody what I think about them."" She fulfills that hidden desire in people.

Writer Hunter Harris tweeted that she can't wait for Ava to get ahold of Beyoncé's ""Renaissance."" What do you think would be her favorite song off the album?

Ooh Ava's favorite. ""I'm That Girl"" which is the opener just to pump herself up going out. Then on the way to the function ""Cuff It."" And then people forget this but Ava is also a church girl. In the episode when you find out she blackmailed the superintendent it's because they all go to the same church. So ""Church Girl"" is definitely in the mix. And then coming home ""Alien Superstar."" So it's not really a favorite song – ""what's the playlist?"" is the real question.

So many of us were rooting for you at the Emmys but it was also wonderful to see your co-star Sheryl Lee Ralph get her moment. What was it like being in the room and hearing her speech?

Honestly I didn't even hear it. I was so just like ""Oh my God I'm at the Emmys."" I know her initial shock and I knew I had to help her get up to the stage but I didn't even hear. I was just looking around at everyone else's reactions to it like ""Oh my God there's Lizzo!"" I was there with my best friend whom I started comedy (with) 11 years ago and we were just tripping over the fact we were at the Emmys. I still haven't stopped tripping over that fact. And I'm proud of Sheryl I'm happy for her: A win for her is a win for the show. We're an Emmy-winning show now.

When you started doing stand-up in Champaign Illinois could you have imagined all this? (In addition to ""Abbott"" James also hosts the ABC game show ""The Final Straw."")

No. I was like ""Oh if I could headline the Chuckle Hut one day and get paid more than $500 that would be amazing"" because that's all I knew when I started. Something that allows me to use my wit and be myself – I've just always been looking for that. I don't have goals. (Laughs.) I really just keep myself open to whatever comes and do my best."

XEN 63 Gel Implant provides innovative treatment option for Canadians impacted by glaucoma

MONTREAL Sept. 27 2022 /CNW/ - AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) announced today the availability of the XEN® 63 Gel Implant a surgical implant designed to lower high eye pressure in open angle glaucoma sufferers where previous medical treatment options have failed.1 The XEN 63 Gel Implant is an additional option for surgeons clinically proven to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.3

""I see the impact of glaucoma on patients' quality of life every day in my practice. Glaucoma typically damages the peripheral vision first so it often goes unnoticed by patients as the disease worsens. That's why glaucoma is known as the silent thief of sight"" said Dr. David Yan Ophthalmologist-in-Chief Mount Sinai Hospital University of Toronto and Glaucoma Service Director Kensington Eye Institute. ""XEN 63 Gel Implant offers patients a new surgical option to reduce intraocular pressure when medical therapy cannot adequately control the disease and renewed hope to prevent optic nerve damage.""

XEN 63 is a gel implant consisting of a small 6mm long tube delivered via a micro-incisional glaucoma surgery.12 It creates a new fluid outflow channel using a similar principle to conventional trabeculectomy but allows fluid to bypass the impaired trabecular meshwork the drainage system that becomes impaired in glaucoma.24

""Glaucoma affects more than 728000 Canadians. It is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness. Anyone can develop glaucoma but there are several different factors that can increase your risk of developing the disease"" said Doug Earle President and CEO of Fighting Blindness Canada. ""It's both exciting and important to see new innovative treatment options being approved that could have a positive impact on Canadians living with primary open angle glaucoma.""

""As a leader in Eye Care in Canada we are committed to help preserve and protect people's vision through innovating and addressing the greatest unmet needs in glaucoma"" says Tracey Ramsay Vice President and General Manager AbbVie Canada. ""Today we're pleased to launch the XEN 63 Gel Implant and offer a minimally invasive solution for uncontrolled primary open angle glaucoma.""

The glaucoma treatment spectrum extends from pharmacotherapy involving topical medications (eye drops) as the first-line therapy to traditional invasive filtration surgeries such as trabeculectomy and aqueous shunt implantation.567 Common challenges associated with pharmacotherapy include ineffective use (e.g. incorrect dose timing or administration)89 local or systemic side effects (e.g. irritation) or toxicity1011 and considerable lifetime costs.12 Filtration surgical options are typically used in advanced glaucoma cases or when targeting a very low intraocular pressure as a treatment outcome.13 These invasive surgeries may be considered for medically refractory cases or when there are such issues as intolerable side effects or from ineffective use of medications.14

About Glaucoma

Glaucoma affects more than 728000 Canadians and takes the form of several related disease types the most common being open angle glaucoma.15 Glaucoma is characterized by a build-up of aqueous humour fluid and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) that damages the optic nerve.15 There is no cure for glaucoma but early detection and treatment can help prevent damage to the optic nerve and as a result save vision.15

About XEN 63

XEN is a gel implant consisting of a small 6mm long tube delivered via a micro-incisional glaucoma surgery which is intended to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with primary open angle glaucoma where previous medical treatments have failed.1 The XEN filtration procedure creates a new fluid outflow channel using a similar principle to trabeculectomy but allows fluid to bypass the impaired trabecular meshwork.23 XEN is inserted via an ab-interno approach1 (from within the anterior chamber) and allows aqueous humor to flow out from the anterior chamber into the subconjunctival space minimizing tissue disruption seen with trabeculectomy or traditional glaucoma drainage implants.13 16 XEN 63 consists of a small tube that is 6mm long.1 The inner diameter of XEN63 is 63µm and the external diameter is 170µm.1 XEN63 has an outflow resistance of 2-3mmHg.6 XEN63 was developed to increase the aqueous humor ﬂow rate with the intention of potentially providing lower IOPs.

What Are Smart Beta ETFs?

Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market or a specific segment of the market and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.

Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.

But there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.

This kind of index follows this same mindset as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics or a mix of such characteristics.

The smart beta space gives investors many different choices from equal-weighting one of the simplest strategies to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.

Fund Sponsor & Index

Because the fund has amassed over $11.51 billion this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. HDV is managed by Blackrock. This particular fund before fees and expenses seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index.

The Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index offers exposure to high quality U.S. domiciled companies that have had strong financial health and an ability to sustain above average dividend payouts.

Cost & Other Expenses

Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins other things remaining the same.

With one of the least expensive products in the space this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.08%.

The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.92%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

Representing 23.70% of the portfolio the fund has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector; Energy and Consumer Staples round out the top three.

Taking into account individual holdings Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) accounts for about 7.15% of the fund's total assets followed by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Abbvie Inc (ABBV).

HDV's top 10 holdings account for about 36.64% of its total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

Year-to-date the iShares Core High Dividend ETF has lost about -6.08% so far and was up about 1.60% over the last 12 months (as of 09/27/2022). HDV has traded between $92.47 and $109.92 in this past 52-week period.

The fund has a beta of 0.80 and standard deviation of 22.56% for the trailing three-year period which makes HDV a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 81 holdings it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

IShares Core High Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. However there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.

IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $47.62 billion in assets Vanguard Value ETF has $90.57 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.

Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.

“More licensed mid-band spectrum is needed to meet growing wireless network demand” said Tejas Rao managing director Accenture. “Commercial access to the bands described in our study would help scale 5G giving more people access to consistent and good internet connectivity needed for things like online schooling remote work and telemedicine.”



According to the study the US wireless industry currently has access to 5% of lower mid-band spectrum while unlicensed spectrum users have access to 7x and government users have access to 12x that amount. The study finds that the following three blocks of lower mid-band spectrum offer the greatest potential for 5G expansion:

350 MHz in the 3.1-4.5 GHz band : The lower 3 GHz band offers reliable coverage and adequate range of coverage making it ideal for 5G data traffic. This band is adjacent to the recently auctioned 3.45 GHz band which would help drive lower costs for device manufacturers when developing products for a wider contiguous band.

: The lower 3 GHz band offers reliable coverage and adequate range of coverage making it ideal for 5G data traffic. This band is adjacent to the recently auctioned 3.45 GHz band which would help drive lower costs for device manufacturers when developing products for a wider contiguous band. 400 MHz in the 4.4-4.94 GHz band : The mid 4 GHz band is a wide contiguous block of spectrum that provides high capacity for 5G networks. It has been allocated to wireless carriers in many other nations meaning a similar allocation in the US would support international harmonization efforts yielding cost benefits.

: The mid 4 GHz band is a wide contiguous block of spectrum that provides high capacity for 5G networks. It has been allocated to wireless carriers in many other nations meaning a similar allocation in the US would support international harmonization efforts yielding cost benefits. 400 MHz in the 7.125-8.4 GHz band: The 7 to 8.4 GHz range is a significant block of higher frequency contiguous spectrum. The capacity characteristics of this range make it ideal for serving densely populated areas such as urban centers where traffic requirements are greater.

Allocating these three bands for commercial wireless use would result in unlicensed users having access to 1.19x and government users having access to 1.34x the amount of spectrum as commercial wireless users.



“America has the world’s leading 5G networks but with data growth doubling every year we need a pipeline of mid-band spectrum to keep up with demand” said Meredith Atwell Baker president and CEO CTIA. “Mid-band spectrum is key to building 5G networks because of its blend of capacity and range. This study details why balancing government and commercial spectrum access is critical to maintaining and securing our leadership of the emerging 5G economy.”



According to another recent commissioned CTIA report other countries lead the US with an average of 530 MHz of lower mid-band spectrum available for commercial wireless networks. Without government action the US is projected to continue to trail by an average of 413 MHz in five years’ time.



Report Methodology

Accenture examined the current state of spectrum allocation in the US across 4 groupings of bands which for the purposes of this report have been defined as: Low-Band (0.3 – 3 GHz) Lower Mid-Band (3 – 8.4 GHz) Upper Mid-Band (8.4 – 24 GHz) and High-Band. Each MHz of spectrum was categorized by stakeholder and use. To conduct this analysis a combined data set was constructed by with data sourced from the NTIA Spectrum Allocation Chart FCC Spectrum Auctions since 1994 the FCC Code of Federal Regulations (Title 47 Part 15) FCC information on specific bands and band plans and the FCC ULS Database to create a holistic view on the spectrum allocation landscape as it stands at a point in time.

Tencent and Accenture jointly published a white paper titled Immersive Convergence on Monday outlining a concept originated by Pony Ma. According to the white paper Immersive Convergence is an innovative model that integrates the digital economy and the real world.

“There will soon be a new connection that integrates digital and physical forms transcending time and space” said Pony Ma Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Tencent. “The doors to the future are open with ‘Immersive Convergence.’ It offers new solutions to users industries and society and is set to bring new application scenarios incubate a new industrial ecology and shape a new way of life.”

Immersive Convergence can do a number of things:

For individual users it can provide an immersive experience anytime anywhere.

For enterprises and organizations it can make services more measurable enhancing quality and driving organizational efficiency.

For society as a whole it can improve resource utilization innovate the model of industry development enhance operational efficiency of the public sectors and promote sustainable development.

Critical Technologies are Constantly Evolving

“Based on the immersive experience and real-time digital twin Immersive Convergence can be put into practice and executed in the real world through two-way interaction” said Dowson Tong Senior Executive Vice President and CEO of the Cloud and Smart Industry Group.

To fully realize Immersive Convergence requires the continuous evolution of five critical technologies. The digital twin and remote interaction functions are the model's core technologies. Ubiquitous intelligence trusted platform module (TPM) and infinite computing power also form its foundation.

With the Internet of Things (IoT) real-time communication (RTC) extended reality (XR) multi-sensory interaction and multi-modal fusion sensing technology remote interaction can be upgraded into two-way interaction. In the future remote interaction will also provide a full sensory experience. For example port operators can use audio and video technologies coupled with multi-angle cameras to handle containers remotely in a more efficient way.

The white paper pointed out that key enabling technologies are either relatively mature or are under rapid development. By 2040 quantum computing holographic projection folded optical path technology brain-computer interface and other cutting-edge technologies are expected to see further breakthroughs in supporting the realization of Immersive Convergence.

Integration of Digital Economy and the Real World is Key to Solving Practical Issues

Immersive Convergence's ultimate goal is to solve issues in real scenarios using the integration of the digital economy and the real world as its main connecting point.

Tencent has built a number of successful cases of Immersive Convergence. A good example is Tencent Meeting a widely used cloud conferencing product in China with an overseas version called VooV Meeting which has supported more than 300 million users worldwide. Tencent Meeting has opened its API and SDK interface committing to building an open ecology for video conferences that connect people.

Tencent also collaborates with a partner to explore building a “digital factory"" with fully restored holographic glasses-free 3D effects. This application leverages technologies such as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) digital twin and distributed cloud to help experts and engineers manage the actual production line and equipment.

In the financial services industry more banks are leveraging Tencent’s technologies such as audio and video AI and big data to create an immersive financial services scene. Businesses that had to be queued offline in the past now can be handled online which helps residents who live in remote areas migrant workers and people with limited mobility.

“The integration of digital technology and the real economy is becoming a top priority and industry trend. Immersive Convergence is an important strategy and roadmap for Tencent’s Industrial Internet to accelerate. Tencent will join its partners to help organizations leverage Immersive Convergence to enhance business efficiency while reducing costs and realizing the value of the industry to make the world a better place” Tong said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaGJyLm9yZy8yMDIyLzA5L2tlZXBpbmctdXAtd2l0aC1jdXN0b21lcnMtaW5jcmVhc2luZ2x5LWR5bmFtaWMtbmVlZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keeping Up with Customers' Increasingly Dynamic Needs,"Summary.

Over time businesses have moved from a product-centric approach focused on performance to a customer-centric strategy meant to prioritize experience. But today’s dynamics are more complicated. Companies need to accept their customers as ever-changing complex people deeply impacted by unpredictable external forces — an approach the authors call life centricity. Life-centric businesses are deeply attuned to the forces that most profoundly affect their customers’ lives such as technology health and culture. They achieve relevance by bridging the interplay between these life forces and their customers’ everyday decisions. And they maintain that relevance by perpetually evolving their products marketing sales and service experiences as life continues to shift.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmFzaWEvbmV3cy81MjMwL2FjY2VudHVyZS1zdXN0YWlucy1oeWJyaWQtd29ya2luZy1zZXR1cC1pbi10aGUtcGhpbGlwcGluZXPSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5hc2lhL25ld3MvYW1wLzUyMzAvYWNjZW50dXJlLXN1c3RhaW5zLWh5YnJpZC13b3JraW5nLXNldHVwLWluLXRoZS1waGlsaXBwaW5lcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accenture sustains hybrid working setup in the Philippines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmFzaWEvbmV3cy81MjMwL2FjY2VudHVyZS1zdXN0YWlucy1oeWJyaWQtd29ya2luZy1zZXR1cC1pbi10aGUtcGhpbGlwcGluZXPSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5hc2lhL25ld3MvYW1wLzUyMzAvYWNjZW50dXJlLXN1c3RhaW5zLWh5YnJpZC13b3JraW5nLXNldHVwLWluLXRoZS1waGlsaXBwaW5lcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001AFDA485720>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

September 27 2022 - Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center collaborated with Accenture Avanade and Microsoft to develop and launch a telemedicine platform in August 2021 which has since been used for more than 200000 virtual appointments a Sept. 26 press release announced.

Through the COVID-19 pandemic virtual resources and remote care technology implementation skyrocketed. To meet the rise in patient demand MSK created the platform known as MSK Telemedicine.

“There was an incredible need for us to make changes in our technology during the early days of the pandemic so our DigITs team worked tirelessly to develop MSK Telemedicine” said Atefeh Riazi MSK’s chief information officer in a press release.

In 2021 MSK surveyed radiation oncology patients and found that patients who used telehealth were satisfied and felt they received high-quality effective care.

A majority of respondents said their confidence in their physician (90 percent) understanding of the treatment plan (88 percent) and confidence in their treatment (87 percent) were better or no different during a telemedicine visit than in an in-person office visit.

This further prompted MSK to develop the telemedicine platform with assistance from Accenture Avanade and Microsoft. The companies worked with the MSK Digital Informatics and Technology Solutions team to create and refine MSK Telemedicine over the past year.

“MSK Telemedicine was designed to give our patients more options to receive care and it will remain an important tool for us to bring exceptional care and expertise to our patients when and where they need us” continued Riazi.

The platform integrates with Microsoft Teams and patients can participate in meetings using a web browser hosted by Microsoft Azure Communications Services. Patients can complete virtual check-in processes through the platform like filling in forms and surveys. Further MSK care coordinators nurses fellows interpreters as well as patients' families and friends can join the virtual visit if needed.

The announcement about the platform follows recent news that MSK received a grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to create a telehealth research center. The organization will use the funding to establish the MATCHES (Making Telehealth Delivery of Cancer Care at Home Effective and Safe) Telehealth Research Center at MSK which aims to evaluate the quality of telehealth services.

Recently several healthcare organizations have announced efforts to enhance cancer care using telehealth and analytics technology.

In August Northwestern Medicine announced plans to create a telehealth research center funded by the NCI that will track smoking obesity and inactivity among cancer patients and study how telehealth can help mitigate these health risk behaviors.

Also in August researchers created a deep-learning algorithm to enhance lung cancer radiation therapy treatment. Brigham and Women’s Hospital researchers developed the algorithm to detect non-small cell lung cancer tumors within computed tomography scans."

According to company officials the new asset will expand their product portfolio with Figma’s web-based multiplayer capabilities and accelerate the delivery of Adobe’s Creative Cloud technologies on the web.

In a statement Chairman and CEO of Adobe Shantanu Narayen said “The combination of Adobe and Figma is transformational and will accelerate our vision for collaborative creativity.”

However the acquisition comes with several layers including intent questions of collaboration of an acquired tool vs. market elimination learning curves for UX designers and what if any software suites will fade into the sunset.

Figma Had What Adobe Didn't

Sheila Mahoutchian Forrester senior analyst said when it comes to enabling real-time full-featured browser-based collaboration Adobe was simply “late to the game.”

By comparison Figma with its real-time collaboration and rapid prototyping capabilities was far ahead — having already penetrated markets at companies like Airbnb BP Kimberly-Clark Microsoft and Salesforce.

“Figma's best-in-class collaboration workflow platform has changed the landscape for design tools moving the world of design from individual contributors to collaboration-based team enablement” Mahoutchian said. “We're looking forward to learning more on how Adobe will integrate these trends and learnings into its expansive suite of design tools.”

In the past designers would be assigned a deliverable or an asset to create. They would go off and create it then bring it back as a final deliverable. However she said since a lot of that work was print and early web experiences they didn’t have dynamic changing needs to respond to — just an objective and a resulting asset that endeavored to meet that objective.

Digital experience assets in service to a refined and constantly evolving customer experience are the primary deliverables needed from designers according to Mahoutchian. They want to drive most of a brand’s customer interaction which moves quickly due to rapid market evolution increased customer digital literacy and value-based differentiation she added as opposed to commoditized price differentiations.

“Inherent in the shift is an expansion toward more input in shorter timeframes from diverse stakeholders toward the creation and deployment of those assets"" Mahoutchian said.

Collaboration or Elimination Play?

The Figma acquisition is all about getting rid of the competition said Darren Hood experience design manager at Arity.

“From a business perspective Adobe has once again eliminated a major competitor” Hood said. “There are reports they will allow Figma to operate independently but even the most novice of businesspeople knows that wouldn't be smart or savvy.”

Oen Michael Hammonds IBM distinguished design executive said these acquisitions happen a lot and on the surface it can appear as if Adobe taking out the competition.

“Back in the early 2000's Adobe acquired Macromedia and slowly took features from Freehand Fireworks and other products and integrated them into their core offerings” Hammonds said. “My hypothesis is that this is what they will do with Figma. I would not be surprised though if Figma becomes a core product and XD (Adobe's design tool) actually gets sunset.”

Tony Brinton founder and principal at Brinton Design and director of digital at OTTO Brand Lab said at the end of the day Adobe decided it’s a better path to acquire Figma than to chase them for years.

“It seems to me that Adobe recognized that Figma delivers a collaborative design experience that UX/UI professionals on the product side and marketing side have been wanting” Brinton said. “Figma took a modern approach to technologically architecting the platform with that goal in mind — it’s a true cloud-based platform where Adobe products are sort of a hybrid model — they had the challenge of backing their legacy products into that model so there were compromises and limitations.”

In Align With Design

What's the back story on Figma? Figma came out of nowhere in 2016 to become ""the operating system"" for designers said Tom Wentworth chief marketing officer at Recorded Future.

“Designers love Figma for its speed and simplicity"" he added. ""But they have a more complicated relationship with the Adobe Creative Cloud leaving Adobe quite vulnerable. That's why Adobe needs Figma to solidify its base of creative users and was willing to pay a massive premium for access to that audience.”

Brian Nemhauser vice president of product at Propel Inc. said Adobe has been dedicated to serving the creative professional user for decades and as the core of its business it will always look to bring the best tools in the industry for critical creative work under one roof so that users get everything they need from Creative Cloud.

“Figma has become the clear standard for screen design and this move allows Adobe to continue to be the one-stop shop for creative pros and for users to get everything they need for one price” Nemhauser said. “Acquisition has been a crucial component of Adobe's business from the days of Photoshop and After Effects to Macromedia and now Figma. Each of those moves brought new expertise and capabilities to Adobe and resulted in significant new value for users and the company.”

Since Adobe is primarily a desktop-first application company Nemhauser said the acquisition of Figma and its web-first application will allow Adobe to have a proven web platform that delivers more fully on the promise of Creative Cloud.

“In this space creative work can happen anywhere and the Adobe funnel will be improved by simplifying and accelerating the time needed to go from awareness to active use of a tool” he said. ""In other words — no need to wait for a 2GB download.”

What It Means for Adobe Users

Hood believes that the answer to what’s ahead remains to be seen because Adobe's history is chock full of instances where it sunset the least popular or the least robust of competing tools even if it meant doing so to its own product like Dreamweaver vs. GoLive and Flash vs. LiveMotion.

“Based on this history we have seen that Adobe is not averse to placing an acquired product on center stage” Hood said. “Between Figma and XD Figma appears to be more popular. For this reason I think it would be wise for XD users to get acquainted with Figma.”

Brinton agrees and said the real question should be what this deal means for Adobe XD users.

“Since Adobe will no longer be developing or supporting XD designers should move over to Figma as soon as possible” Brinton said. “There will be a learning curve which will be easier or harder depending on the individual but the two share enough of the same conceptual paradigms that it shouldn’t be too heavy a burden.”

Nemhauser said the rise of Figma reinvigorated a space that was somewhat stagnant.

“Every new business needs a website and many need an app"" he said. ""The pandemic has accelerated the move of many businesses online and led to greater demand for UX design. It's a great time to be a UX designer and this move by Adobe demonstrates just how critical they see those users and their needs are to the future of creative work.”

He believes the acquisition of Figma will provide several advantages for Adobe users including:

More value for the same price

Greater integration between Adobe's flagship tools and the Figma platform that will simplify workflows and save time

More web-based tools in the future likely built on the Figma codebase

“In time it will mean smoother and easier workflows in working with Adobe flagship tools” Nemhauser said. “It will also likely mean that the Figma roadmap will be accelerated and expanded as Adobe will bring their toolset to the Figma codebase instead of vice versa.”

And he added don't be surprised to see things like stock photography fonts and other valuable assets from Adobe made available to Figma users.

What It Means for Figma Users

Adobe's takeover may mean nothing at first according to Brinton. But as for the future it’s a “wait and see” scenario.

“Many designers that have been around a while"" he said. ""Remember Adobe’s acquisition of Macromedia which most of us old timers agree was a travesty because Adobe arrogantly gutted some of their competitive products which were frankly better. Macromedia understood design for screens/digital from the jump whereas Adobe did not. Adobe could argue that Photoshop’s market share as the interactive designer’s tool of choice for many years would prove that statement wrong but it doesn’t. It was always a bad tool for that kind of work and it was never the intent of the software. So many designers just put up with it for way too long.”

Hood once again emphasized that Figma users who are not already familiar with the Adobe universe should begin acquainting themselves.

“If Figma supplants XD it could be included with an Adobe Creative Suite subscription” Hood said. “Adobe is also not hesitant to market its most popular products outside the scope of its suites.""

In other words he wouldn't be surprised to see Figma included with the Adobe Creative Suite and offered as a solo product such as they do today with Photoshop Lightroom and other applications.

Dylan Field Figma’s co-founder and CEO will continue to lead the Figma team reporting to David Wadhwani president of Adobe’s Digital Media business. And in a blog post addressing the sale he noted the merger was an opportunity for Figma “to accelerate the growth and innovation of the Figma platform with access to Adobe’s technology expertise and resources in the creative space.”

Each company will continue to operate independently until the transaction closes in 2023 — but Field emphasized that Figma will retain a certain level of autonomy.

“The entire Figma team will report to me” he stated. “We plan to continue to run Figma the way we have always run Figma — continuing to do what we believe is best for our community our culture and our business.”

However for Figma fans the changes may take some getting used to.

“It will be scary at first as many have seen Figma as an alternative to Adobe tools” Nemhauser said. “Adobe will likely do the wise thing here and take steps to reassure Figma users that the tool will be exactly the same product they have come to love and there should be additional value added for free.”

Hammonds agrees there will be a slight pain period for users of both products as they figure out integrations across products. He added “The hope is that Adobe is listening to all the core users of these products and also remember lessons learned from the Macromedia acquisition.”

What It Means for the UX Design Space

Hammonds doesn’t think the Figma acquisition will have as big an impact on the UX design space as people seem to think.

“Designers need to be resourceful and growth minded when these tooling shifts happen” Hammonds said. “They happen a lot. Either next week next month or a year from now someone else will come out with the next best UX thing and this cycle will start over again.”

According to Brinton the fact that this is news at all is testament to the continued rise of UX Design over many years which he believes is a wonderful thing.

“Consolidation like Adobe’s acquisition of Figma often stifles innovation"" Brinton said. ""There’s a chance that Figma will not continue to develop at the rate that it has been or that Adobe will force-fit it into their ecosystem like a square peg in a round hole. Let’s hope not. Since it was such a big deal Adobe no doubt has a strong vision for the future. It would be interesting if Adobe looked to Figma’s technical foundation as the new ground zero for Adobe’s ecosystem. A fresh start perhaps?”

Hood admits he is known for stressing that pure UX is a tool-agnostic discipline and while many are taken aback by the recent acquisition news he believes it should be known and understood that Adobe's purchase of Figma actually has zero impact on the UX design world.

“The pillars of UX and its many methods and methodologies are still in place and haven't moved one iota” he said. “If a tool dictated our state we would be in grave danger as a discipline.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTI4L2Fkb2JlLXNheXMtZmlnbWEtd2lsbC1zdGF5LWVhc3ktdG8tdXNlLWFmdGVyLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Outlines Figma Feature Ideas Commits to Keeping Free Tier,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bloomberg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/articles/2022-09-28/adobe-says-figma-will-stay-easy-to-use-after-acquisition (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001AFDAED6110>, 'Connection to www.bloomberg.com timed out.

As part of the latest announcements Adobe Target has announced the following enhancements:

AI motion controlled Automated Personalization

Automated Personalization or AP works on advanced machine learning algorithms specifically built for personalization. It has been found that ML algorithms can greatly improve the personalized experiences and increase the conversion rates for digital experiences. AP in Adobe Target activates every marketing communication with the customer using Random Forest Algorithm. This ML algorithm delivers powerful visitors profile matching capabilities and then automatically personalizes content for an improved lift.

Automated Personalization builds a database of visitors and their activities across multiple touch-points. This information is them fed to Machine Learning algorithm training model to create Random Forest Algorithms for each customer experience and offer. After AP tests the ML algorithms for a threshold quality check Adobe Target then filters the campaign toward driving a meaningful personalized traffic with minimum human intervention or analysis. Multiple self-learning algorithms are available in AP that can be combined with other AI and data science techniques such a Thompson Sampling and Multi-armed Bandit or MaB.

ll these come together within Adobe Target to deliver rank-ordered offers on a homepage and a ranked product page design on a PDP.

Auto-Target

Part of Adobe Premium package Auto-Target (AT) like AP is again an ML-based advanced CX and content personalization solution to drive conversions. Users leverage this ML solution to create the most tailored experience for an individual user. Its Random Forest Algorithms merges with the MaB to build a model specifically purposed to self-learn traffic trends without over-exploitation. These models are efficient in recreating and rebuilding newer algorithms every 24 hours based on visitor’s online behavioral and preferences’ data. Advanced trend spotting involved MaB merged with performance enhancing technique called the Thompson Sampling.

Automated personalization activity provides more personalization than Auto-target for the same volume of traffic per experience fed to train and build the respective Ml algorithms. On the other hand Auto-target allows lot of opportunities with A/B workflow for building continuously improving self-learning augmentative ML models based on real-world conditions.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,"With its stock down 27% over the past month it is easy to disregard Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But if you pay close attention you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly we will be paying attention to Adobe's ROE today.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

View our latest analysis for Adobe

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Adobe is:

33% = US$4.8b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).

The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments the company generates a profit of $0.33.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking other things being equal firms with a high return on equity and profit retention have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

Adobe's Earnings Growth And 33% ROE

First thing first we like that Adobe has an impressive ROE. Second a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result Adobe's exceptional 23% net income growth seen over the past five years doesn't come as a surprise.

Next on comparing Adobe's net income growth with the industry we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 25% in the same period.

The basis for attaching value to a company is to a great extent tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth or the lack of it is already built into the share price. By doing so they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So you may want to check if Adobe is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E relative to its industry.

Story continues

Is Adobe Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Adobe doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.

Summary

In total we are pretty happy with Adobe's performance. Particularly we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Due to its six core the temperatures are way more manageable and for gaming you know it 8-cores are preferred but 6-cores will run just fine. The CPU will be analyzed tested and benchmarked. It may become AMD's sweet spot processor due to its exceptional performance and utterly new architecture that enables PCIe Gen 5 DDR5 and a CPU that quickly hits the 5.3 and with good cooling a 5.4 GHz range.

AMD announced its first ZEN4-based Ryzen 7000 processors. While some updated graphics cards have been released this year not much else has been released in the component hardware arena. However the year will close with a bang with new products from AMD Intel and NVIDIA. Over the summer nearly all specifications somehow leaked the products you see launched today. Today is about the processor and motherboards. The new 5nm FinFET fabrication technique used the first for a desktop CPU and enhanced performance combined with higher power efficiency are among the primary highlights of the new processor generation. More information on AM5 motherboards for these models can now be provided as well as AMD EXPO a new automatic RAM SPD standard. The AMD Ryzen 7000 series is available today and launches based on the Ryzen 9 7950X and 7900X the Ryzen 7 7700X and the Ryzen 5 7600X. The base and boost clock speeds are significantly increased in the four new CPU types compared to their predecessors. Unlike Intel Zen4 has no hybrid design and solely big/P(erformance) cores. It remains to be seen whether AMD will ever launch hybrid (big/small) cores. You can even argue that design as it requires significant work on the Windows scheduler for Windows 11 workloads do not easily lend themselves to a hybrid design even on mobile platforms where efficiency is a significant goal.

A non-hybrid design such as the Zen4 is strongly favored in this regard for desktop users and PC gamers. The flagship Zen4 desktop CPU Ryzen 9 7950X will have 16 cores and 32 threads and is priced at USD 699. The Ryzen 9 7900X with 12 cores and 24 threads with a boost speed of up to 5.6 GHz will cost USD 549. Probably the most popular processor will be the 8-core Ryzen 7 7700X priced at USD 399; closing the lineup for now is the Ryzen 5 7600X proceed USD 299. On September 27th 2022 all four CPUs are now available. The Ryzen 7000 series will offer a 13% increase in IPC over its predecessors and up to a 29% increase in single-thread performance. This is primarily due to the higher clock speeds which now reach 5.7 GHz on the flagship model a staggering 800 MHz increase over the existing series. This is mainly attributable to the upgraded Zen 4 architecture and smaller TSMC 5nm manufacturing process.

A first in a long time is a new processor socket which allows for features like DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 and necessitates the purchase of new motherboards. The 600-series chipsets are built into these (X670E X670 B650E and B650). All the processors include an integrated RDNA2 GPU and PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 compatibility (E suffix is Extreme). It'll provide fantastic gaming and normal workloads given its bottom-of-the-release-stack pricing — which is still not cheap. The 7600X performs admirably in both single and multi-threaded activities. We'll test this processor with an ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero motherboard."

This week BamaCentral is breaking apart the All Things CW notes column by Christopher Walsh into five parts one each day leading up to Saturday's game at Arkansas. This is ...

Take 2

I've written before about how both Alabama coach Nick Saban and Jackson State coach Deion Sanders both use the Aflac ads they do together to help support some of their favorite causes. For Sanders its HBCU schools and for Saban it's the Nick's Kids Foundation and building a house with Habitat of Humanity whenever the Crimson Tide wins a championship.

Sanders though has really put his money where his mouth is when it comes to his latest passion. I can also confirm from experience that when he gets behind something he really gets behind it.

Full disclosure: Years ago when starting out as a journalist my first job was with the News-Press in Fort Myers Fla. the hometown of the one famously known as ""Prime Time."" The newspaper didn't have the greatest relationship with him but we did have a good one with his impressive mother Connie Knight.

A memorable story for me before he played in Super Bowl XXIX with the San Francisco 49ers was talking to fans in his old neighborhood about the two-sport star going for his first championship. They were excited and said they hoped to see more of him back home (one suggested he help build a local ice arena).

Sanders may be a showman but he also backs it up. He's given both Jackson State and HBCU schools a huge presence and mouthpiece and has been shaking up the way things have traditionally been done in college football.

This year alone he donated half of his $300000 coaching salary to help renovate JSU’s stadium in Mississippi’s capital city helped the team's biggest game against Alcorn State have a sold-out record crowd and even has a former NFL head coach Mike Zimmer formerly of the Minnesota Vikings helping out.

This is on top of Travis Hunter arguably the top recruit in the nation for the Class of 2022 surprising college football fans across the country and playing for Sanders at Jackson State. Sports Illustrated called the move “probably the most shocking decision in the history of college football recruiting.”

Sanders is also not alone. Other HBCUs have brought in big-name coaches like Eddie George (Tennessee State) and Hue Jackson (Grambling State).

So what does this have to do with Alabama outside of the ad campaign?

Simple it's time the the SEC and Alabama consider playing teams from the Southwestern Athletic Conference the Football Championship Series league the Tigers play in that’s made up entirely of HBCUs.

Any game between an SEC program and an HBCU probably wouldn't be close and there's really not a lot for an SEC school to gain with such a matchup. But the difference it could make could be huge and not just in football.

According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center the most recent numbers show a 4.7 percent year-over-year drop in undergraduate enrollment at colleges and a 9.4 percent decrease since the onset of the pandemic.

The demographic most alarming in the decline is Black freshmen with enrollment down 18.7 percent since spring 2020.

Alabama of course is an exception. It just announced a record of 38645 students enrolled in fall 2022. The record enrollment was boosted by the largest freshman class in school history (8037).

Chances are we won't be seeing the Crimson Tide suit up against a SWAC program in the near future especially since the SEC could soon go to a nine-game conference schedule. Alabama already has a bunch of high-profile home-and-home games under contract through the next decade and mismatches no longer lead to a jam-packed Bryant-Denny Stadium.

Consequently if any program in the SEC should play Jackson State it should probably be Ole Miss or Mississippi State so at least it could attract in-state fans. Rebels coach Lane Kiffin was asked about it at media days in July and he gave a very ""Prime Time""-like answer with ""It's been great to see Deion's success and how well he's doing. I don't know future plans on that but that would be exciting.""

Ole Miss and Jackson State haven't played each other since the Tigers' inaugural season in 1911.

Meanwhile Utah State and Louisiana Monroe recently got more than $1.9 million to play at Bryant-Denny Stadium with Warhawks coach Terry Bowden saying the blowout loss will pay for a new weight room. For an FCS opponent Alabama is set to pay Mercer a $600000 guarantee for a 2024 meeting.

Imagine what those kinds of payouts could do for an HBCU school.

For many though it is decidedly uncomfortable. A networking event can feel awkward at best or manipulative and insincere at worst. Networking skills however are critical to many aspects of career growth and success. With the right mindset and with a few methodologies to follow anyone can be successful at networking at a conference within your own company network or even in remote situations.

What is networking? Networking is about creating relationships in which there is a mutual exchange of value. Note the focus on relationships. It is not a transactional activity focused on creating a stack of business cards that you can use later when you have a specific need. While many people imagine a crowded happy hour at an industry event when they hear “networking” the skills are used much more broadly. Yes making new contacts at that happy hour is a common networking opportunity but so are small group discussions at an industry event one-on-one meetings within your company and working side-by-side with others outside your work group. Each of these settings is an opportunity to build relationships through which you can help each other achieve goals.

Keep these rules in mind as you approach networking opportunities:

Beware of assumptions you may make about people. Approach everyone new that you meet with a “people curious” mindset. Before you make any assumptions about how helpful they can be to you focus first on just finding out who they are what they do and what experiences they have. Share the details of your own background as well. Since your goal is to develop mutually beneficial relationships do not enter an initial meeting at a group event with a specific knowledge goal in mind. The goal is simply to meet new people.

Never dismiss anyone. Similarly never dismiss anyone as not deserving of your time or attention. This is basic respect. Everyone has something they can teach you from the receptionist to the CEO. Similarly there are ways you can be helpful to almost everyone. The more you learn about someone the more touch points you will uncover.

Never waste someone’s time. Be as respectful of the value of others’ time as you would like them to be of yours. In a casual setting like a Happy Hour don’t force conversation nor monopolize someone’s time. In scheduled conversations come prepared.

Networking Internally

Networking is different from mentoring although it is common for mentoring relationships to grow from networking activities. Within your organization it is important to network with others who can help you learn new skills or knowledge. Begin by looking inward. Define for yourself what you want to learn and why. Are you trying to understand some aspect of your company’s business? Are you trying to learn a new skill or function? What are you trying to achieve? Is it your own career development or the ability to execute in your current role most effectively? Once the “what” and the “why” are understood you can better capture your knowledge gaps and who might best fill them (note that one contact can help you find others who can help). Always be upfront with someone about why you want to meet with them and be prepared for scheduled discussions. Then ask if there is anything you can do to help them<em-dash>and if they call on you later reciprocate! One method that can be very effective is volunteering to work on committees or projects. This gives you the chance to work together with new people. Working together toward a goal is a great way to build relationships and lets you demonstrate your own skills and your dependability.

Networking is about creating relationships in which there is a mutual exchange of value.

Networking Externally

Building on the discussion around networking internally approach interactions with new people at an external event with the mindset of being “people curious” first. This means getting to know them as human beings first and people who can be of help to you second. Ask them the kinds of questions you’d like to be asked in that situation: begin with basic company affiliation background what brought them to this event what they’ve found interesting thus far etc. Your goal is to always be looking for something you can learn from them and something you can teach them. Don’t try to get to any specific “ask” right away. You are building a relationship which takes time and probably several touch points. As with internal activities look for opportunities to volunteer with industry groups. They always need volunteers and working with someone is a great way to build a solid relationship. If you do volunteer truly commit and deliver on those commitments. Demonstrating dependability and follow through will strengthen the value of those relationships.

Networking Virtually

The same rules generally apply in virtual settings except that you must listen more closely and pay as close attention as you can to body language. Treat virtual meetings the same way you might a large in-person meeting. Initiate direct chat sidebars with people you already know. Make sure you share enough about yourself so that people you don’t know are aware of what you bring to the table—and be open to direct chats with new people. Those virtual break outs are a great chance to further build relationships. Again you are working together toward a specific goal. Just make sure you focus on the task at hand on the call and follow up offline later if there are different topics you would like to discuss.

While networking can be an uncomfortable activity for many viewing networking as an opportunity to build long term mutually beneficial relationships can ease the process. Be authentically curious about the people you meet look for ways you can be helpful in return and always follow through on your commitments. Following this approach can not only help you improve your skills meet your goals and advance your career but as importantly develop the friendships and relationships that make work truly worthwhile.

When it comes to the United States phasing out PFAS the “forever chemicals” are true to their nickname in more ways than one. It’s not going to be straightforward or swift to eliminate these substances from countless industries even though they have been potentially linked to myriad health issues.

Found in products like food packaging clothes and firefighting foam PFAS have contaminated drinking water sources nationwide since becoming commercially available in the middle of the last century building up in the environment where they won’t break down for a very long time.

A recent study concluded that rainwater surface water and ground soil across the globe is extensively contaminated with these chemicals to a point that cannot be reversed without expensive advanced technological intervention.

“This stuff is toxic at incredibly low levels and it’s persistent — it stays there for hundreds of years in the groundwater thousands of years” said Graham Peaslee a Notre Dame professor and researcher who’s tested many products for PFAS in his lab. “And that means the next generations will be drinking it and that’s not the kind of legacy we want to leave our kids.”

It’s a familiar story that has played out before from DDT to PCBs. A hazardous chemical is widely used its adverse health and environmental effects are revealed far after the fact scientists and other concerned parties ring the alarm and the substance in question finally garners federal attention sometimes in the form of improved regulation or more rarely a full-stop ban.

It’s tough and even products claiming to be green clean or eco-friendly could contain the chemicals. One easy rule of thumb: If you’re evaluating two water-resistant products and one is more expensive that’s the one that’s more likely to contain PFAS said Notre Dame professor and researcher Graham Peaslee. “Fluorine chemicals tend to be expensive so they tend to up the price” he added. “That’s not one-for-one absolute. But it’s a tendency we noticed in cosmetics [and] clothing.” Consumers who want more specific help or tips can consult a wide range of resources. Here’s a shortlist plus information for those who who are specifically concerned about PFAS in drinking water: Safer Choice. This database catalogs consumer options including cleaning products that have been reviewed by the Environmental Protection Agency and dubbed safer from a human health and environmental standpoint. Skin Deep. This database from the Environmental Working Group a nonprofit advocacy organization evaluates ingredients in personal care products and gives them a score based on their known safety and data availability. A brief guide. This resource from the State of Washington’s Department of Ecology offers tips on how to reduce PFAS exposure in your home including by avoiding nonstick cookware and vacuuming frequently. The PFAS Exchange. This site offers a wealth of information on PFAS including a map of known and suspected contamination sites across the U.S. and a tool to help evaluate results for people whose blood was tested for PFAS.

We’re well within the third act of that script when it comes to PFAS with many researchers and consumers calling on industries and institutions to phase these chemicals out of their products manufacturing processes and general use and instead pursue safer alternatives that serve similar functions.

The Environmental Protection Agency recently issued two updated interim drinking water health advisories for PFOA and PFOS — two legacy or “long chain” and well-studied PFAS that have been phased out of manufacturing in the U.S. but are still used in other parts of the world and products or materials that contain them can be imported. The agency also issued advisories for two newer “short chain” PFAS known as PFBS and “GenX chemicals” that were developed to replace the legacy substances yet are still problematic from a health and environmental standpoint.

Those EPA advisories don’t carry the force of law PFAS are largely unregulated and nothing is stopping manufacturers from using the chemicals in their supply chains which are often murky to begin with.

Companies face limited pressure — at least at the federal level — to get them out of their supply chains. Multiple states though have taken their own legislative steps toward phasing PFAS out or outright banning them in certain products.

Beyond the regulatory world researchers are leading the way with a vision of what it means to address PFAS contamination at its source. Some companies are also voluntarily taking steps to help make that happen.

It’s realistically going to take several more decades Peaslee said before we can truly get a handle on PFAS. But that doesn’t mean that efforts to stop further contamination by getting it out of existing manufacturing practices and products will be fruitless.

What are PFAS and why are they considered hazardous?

The term “PFAS” stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. It refers to a family of thousands of different chemicals that have a wide range of commercial and industrial uses. These substances are particularly good at repelling things — their dual hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties help them resist water plus oils and stains. These qualities help make products waterproof stain-proof or non-stick in addition to their use as in industrial lubricants.

PFAS have been detected in goods ranging from cosmetics to period underwear to anti-fogging cloths and sprays for glasses among many others. A 2020 study identified them across 200 different use categories.

Only a handful of those thousands of chemicals have been well-studied to determine their impacts on human health. Many experts argue for approaching PFAS as a class of chemicals — as in assuming that less studied members of the chemical family may have health and environmental impacts akin to those that have been better researched and making decisions around their use accordingly.

Existing evidence suggests that high levels of exposure to PFAS – among those that have been better studied – may lead to increased cholesterol levels decreased vaccine responses in children higher risk of preeclampsia in pregnant people and increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer and other outcomes according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

In other words limited research so far suggests that these chemicals can affect multiple systems in the body said Courtney Carignan an environmental epidemiologist and assistant professor at Michigan State University.

“It seems that the property that makes them useful — that they’re very persistent and they have this one part of them that really likes water and the other part that does not — also seems to be what makes them problematic in the body” Carignan said.

Legacy PFAS like PFOA and PFOS were known to take years to leave the body whereas the shorter chain ones more often in use today are shown to be expelled more along the timeframe of months. For consumers labels can be confusing or misleading — a product may boast its “PFOA-free” status for example but that’s just one chemical within the PFAS family.

Both legacy and shorter chain types persist in the environment and can have human health impacts regardless of how long they take for your body to eliminate them which is why many experts maintain that there’s no world in which continuing their use is justified.

“I’ve never met the good PFAS and there are no such things” Peaslee said. “They are all long-lived they all bioaccumulate a good number of them are shown to be toxic and the rest we just haven’t measured yet.”

How do PFAS get into our bodies?

Humans can be exposed to PFAS via ingestion such as by drinking contaminated water or eating fish in which these chemicals have bioaccumulated. Inhalation is another route and it can happen via indoor air — for example if the furniture or carpeting in your home or office has been treated with PFAS to prevent stains — or outdoor air particularly if you live close to a factory that emits PFAS through its stacks.

When it comes to major sources of PFAS contamination in the U.S. “the biggest culprit to date” has been firefighting foam also known as AFFF Peaslee said. As of 2021 the Department of Defense was investigating nearly 700 military installations where this foam was used extensively often during training operations where it had ample opportunity to permeate the environment.

Multiple institutions have made the switch to PFAS-free firefighting foam in recent years or are at least in the process of doing so. Congress has ordered the Department of Defense for example to switch to PFAS-free firefighting foam by October 2024.

But Peaslee noted that the transition isn’t quite that simple — for one thing countless gallons of the older fluorinated foam are still on the shelves at fire stations nationwide and each container could contaminate hundreds of millions of gallons of water. Safely disposing of it is a massive task.

The turnout gear that firefighters wear when they respond to fires is also often treated with PFAS in order to help it resist moisture and heat and many are concerned that wearing and handling it could put them at additional risk. An independent committee facilitated by the National Fire Protection Association has recently drafted new proposed safety standards for that gear which are open to public comment.

Though exposure through consumer products is a reasonable concern there are two even larger facets of the problem said Shari Franjevic who leads the GreenScreen For Safer Chemicals program at the nonprofit Clean Production Action. One is how that product came to exist in the first place – people who might work at a plant where PFAS are produced or heavily used are typically among the most most exposed to the hazardous chemicals. The other is where it will end up once it’s discarded which is a problem for those who live nearby and are exposed through contaminated drinking water.

Once a product that contains PFAS is thrown away it can contaminate the environment in the form of leachate that eventually passes through our wastewater treatment systems which were not designed to remove those chemicals Carignan said.

“I can wrap my hotdog or hamburger in this packaging and the grease will never come through it” Peaslee said explaining the cycle. “That’s good except that when we throw that wrapper away 100% of that PFAS will come off in a landfill in 60 days and then we’re all drinking it.”

Getting PFAS out of products

Plenty of products contain PFAS on purpose in order to perform a specific function. But to Franjevic and the GreenScreen program there’s a distinction between intentionally added PFAS and those that most likely resulted from cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. She argues that “turning off the tap on PFAS” means prioritizing getting the chemicals out of products into which they’ve historically been added on purpose.

GreenScreen helps companies by examining whether chemicals in their products have the potential to harm human health like PFAS and works on how to either swap them out with safer alternatives or reduce exposure if their use is absolutely essential. This comprehensive hazard-first approach helps prevent manufacturers from going down the well-trod path of using substitutes that still come with a slew of their own health and environmental concerns. In the PFAS world many researchers point to those shorter chain chemicals currently still in use that were considered solid replacements for legacy PFAS as an example of that phenomenon.

Meanwhile a plastic part that’s used in a broader product might not contain PFAS by design but could still have detectable amounts of the forever chemicals when tested. That could be because the manufacturer uses a PFAS-containing release agent that helps each part pop out of its mold faster to speed up the production process Franjevic said. Supply chains are often long and there’s plenty of room for cross-contamination.

In her view it’s a first-things-first type of situation: Give companies a realistic pathway toward getting intentionally added PFAS out of their products and then address impurities.

“To notch down impurities now to really really low thresholds puts almost an unfair burden [on manufacturers] and it’s not prioritizing where the biggest impact is” she said. “And so we’re trying to be pragmatic about ‘How do we really create the change we need to see in the world?’”

Several states have passed legislation aimed at getting toxic chemicals out of consumer products including Washington.

After establishing what’s hazardous and what’s a viable alternative the state can take steps to restrict the use of chemical of concern or mandate that consumers be notified if a product contains it explained Rae Eaton a chemist in the Hazardous Waste and Toxics Reduction Program at the Washington State Department of Ecology.

“We’re using chemicals that can last for hundreds of years sometimes for products that get used for 45 minutes and then they go in the trash or they go in your compost.”

Eaton works on a program that evaluates short-term food packaging — think takeout clamshell containers bowls that hold hot soup or paper sandwich wrappers. PFAS are used in some of those materials to keep food from sticking to or soaking through its container before that packaging is discarded.

“We’re using chemicals that can last for hundreds of years sometimes for products that get used for 45 minutes and then they go in the trash or they go in your compost” Eaton said.

Eaton noted that some compostable or recyclable food packaging contains PFAS which is not good news for the industrial compost sites they’re designed for. She and her colleagues have released two reports on takeout-style packaging that analyzed a range of existing products and the purposes they serve then detailed which alternative materials could be feasibly used in place of PFAS. It’s not a complete analysis of every alternative on the market she said but it does include a range of accessible options that are already in use.

Some of those alternatives may be wax or clay-coated materials ones that use polylactic acid (PLA) a biodegradable polymer that can break down under commercial composting conditions or even switching to reusable packaging. Companies can use her team’s analysis as a resource on how to feasibly move away from PFAS-containing products and toward safer more sustainable options.

PFAS will be banned in nine types of food packaging in Washington by September 2024. Eaton said her team is now researching alternatives for longer-term food packaging including microwaveable popcorn bags baking paper and pet food bags and actively soliciting input from businesses that make them particularly if they already don’t use PFAS.

What can governments and individuals do?

In 1987 the Montreal Protocol aimed to phase out hazardous substances — including CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons — that were known at the time to be depleting the ozone layer in Earth’s atmosphere. Today that international agreement is largely considered a success — as of 2019 nations phased out 98 percent of ozone-depleting substances and the hole in the ozone layer that prompted international cooperation was getting smaller according to the UN Environment Program.

PFAS can be used in lubricants in addition to a wide range of consumer products where experts argue they may not be strictly necessary. Photo via Getty Images When PFAS are essential Sometimes there’s just no other choice. For Graham Peaslee of the University of Notre Dame two must-use PFAS examples that come to mind are fluorinated lubricants necessary to send spacecraft on decades-long missions beyond Pluto and a certain type of retinal reattachment surgery that requires floating the eyeball in a PFAS solution. Each of those requires respectively a 2-liter bottle every 20 years and a 55-gallon drum annually for global use he estimates. That’s a minuscule amount in comparison to the overall amount of PFAS we use currently. “Essential use” is more than just a concept – it’s also a framework that could be used to advance this fight. According to a 2019 paper it involves asking: Where are PFAS currently used but don’t need to be? Where could their important function instead be performed by a safer substitute chemical? Where is their use indeed essential based on crucial social needs like health and safety given an absence of alternatives? To get to those conclusions researchers have to consider the function of the PFAS in question in the product or material whether that function is actually essential and if so what unique properties make them so said Ian Cousins professor in the department of environmental sciences at Stockholm University.

But there’s no comparable international agreement or imperative on PFAS. Some environmentally minded companies and governments have led the charge on working to ban or phase out some of these chemicals. But it’s less clear how long it will take others to catch up – and change will depend on decision-makers committing to the effort.

“There’s a combination of challenges that we have to overcome [including] technical challenges to try and find replacements that work but also the vested economic interests that we have to tackle” said Ian Cousins a professor in the department of environmental science at Stockholm University. He’s a leading proponent of a framework that depends on defining when and where the use of PFAS is actually essential.

Plenty of companies are already interested in and working toward making a proactive pivot away from PFAS. But the U.S. regulatory system largely lacks teeth on this issue and it’s not clear that federal officials will mandate that American companies stop using PFAS in their products and supply chains anytime soon.

For now when it comes to companies that aren’t taking initiative a little consumer pressure can go a long way Franjevic said.

She encouraged concerned consumers to contact companies they care about and ask if their products contain PFAS or any other harmful chemicals like phthalates. Corporations tend to track those types of requests and when they get to a certain number she added they may take action.

“If they get enough people asking they will do the work” Franjevic said. “It’ll get on their radar. So ask.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvZW5lcmd5L0Fpci1Db21wYW55LWxhdW5jaGVzLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWF2aWF0aW9uLzEwMC93ZWIvMjAyMi8wOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air Company launches sustainable aviation fuel,"Credit: Craig Bettenhausen/C&EN

The idea of capturing carbon dioxide and using it as a feedstock for valuable chemicals and materials can seem like a pipe dream. But it felt real last week at a swanky launch party in Brooklyn New York where guests sipped on vodka made from captured CO 2 .

The event was put on by Air Company the carbon-utilization start-up that has been hydrogenating CO 2 to make its Air Vodka since 2020. At the party the firm announced it is expanding from turning out $75-a-bottle vodka to making low-carbon jet fuel for some of the world’s biggest consumers.

After a brief recounting of the firm’s journey so far CEO and cofounder Gregory Constantine showed a video taken 2 months earlier of a US Air Force fighter jet taking off powered by Air Company’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Constantine told the crowd that the firm has buyers for its first 1 billion gal (3.8 billion L) of SAF including the US military the airlines JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic and the jet maker Boom Supersonic.

One billion gallons is a lot of jet fuel and having those commitments will help Air Company attract the partners and investment it will need to build commercial-scale plants says Will Thurmond CEO of the biofuel market research firm Emerging Markets Online. But Thurmond cautions that such advanced purchase agreements are relatively common among aspiring SAF makers and don’t guarantee production.

“There are more announcements that ‘We’re going to make it’ than there are announcements of ‘We have delivered it.’ So I would take it with a grain of salt” he says.

Almost all SAF available today is made from waste oils and fats but the limited supply of that feedstock is mostly claimed already. Companies including Gevo and LanzaJet are building plants that will convert biobased alcohol into SAF. Air Company’s cofounder and chief technical officer Stafford Sheehan said his firm’s SAF will come from adjusting the catalyst and process it now uses for ethanol to favor fuel-range hydrocarbons.

Thurmond says the aviation market which is betting on SAF to decarbonize commercial air travel is eager for low-carbon fuel. “There’s enough demand out there to justify it” he says “as long as they can demonstrate that they can do what they say they can do.”

Air Company’s products are the result of the chemical reduction of captured CO 2  and Sheehan acknowledged that they will only be as climate-friendly as the energy that powers the process. As of 2021 the US electrical grid was 19% nuclear 20% renewables and 61% fossil fuels.

When the presentations were done Sheehan and other senior staff took groups across the street to tour the firm’s recently completed pilot plant. Within two years Sheehan said the company will build a demonstration-scale jet fuel plant with capacity to make hundreds of thousands of gallons per year. It plans to ramp up from there to a “world-scale plant to rival fossil fuel production.”"

But they aren’t the only ones with complaints: Airbnb hosts themselves have become increasingly disillusioned with the platform and its disrespectful guests.

On message boards and Facebook groups hosts are sharing their own challenges and horror stories. One host claimed that a group of guests was unwilling to leave the property despite receiving a full refund from Airbnb.

“I went to the apartment to check what was going on and I was in shock to discover that the tenants were still in the apartment” the host wrote on the website AirbnbHell. “They immediately called the police on me and I was kicked out of my own apartment by a team of the police — a complete shock.”

While these anecdotes might seem like the natural byproduct of the largely unregulated short-term rental industry they speak to larger trends impacting hosts. A 2021 report from Bloomberg detailed how Airbnb’s secretive crisis team spends millions of dollars to cover up crimes and other publicity nightmares in its listings. And the platform recently launched “anti-party technology” in an effort to defray hosts’ frustrations with large destructive gatherings.

These issues raise the question: Is Airbnb itself the problem — or are the guests?

Silly string and foul odors

In May of this year Airbnb launched a new “AirCover” protection plan for guests and hosts. It promises quick reimbursement for hosts and up to $1 million in damage protection. And while many hosts consider this policy generous it still comes with plenty of gray areas.

Emily Muskin Rathner a digital marketing professional living in Cleveland began renting her house on Airbnb in August 2021. She says that hosting has been a pleasant and profitable enterprise overall but a few guests have caused major problems including a family that rented the house this June.

“They left the house a mess” she says. “There was human feces on our laundry. They sprayed Silly String all over the place. I don’t care about Silly String but can you pick it up? It left stains oddly.”

Muskin Rathner received reimbursement from Airbnb for most of her claims. But some damage such as nail polish smeared on the bathroom tile didn’t qualify for reimbursement because she wasn’t able to provide documentation for the cost of the tile. And then there was the smell.

“It really really stunk. The air conditioning had been left off for a week — in June.”

Red tape everywhere

The early days of short-term vacation rentals offered hosts a simple proposition: Rent your home and earn some extra money. Yet as the industry has matured it’s been met with regulation efforts from local governments.

Cities such as Denver and Portland Oregon have been cracking down on unlicensed short-term rentals levying fines against hosts and requiring expensive permits. These policies allow local governments to collect taxes and regulate problematic behavior but they add one more layer of complexity for hosts many of whom have little experience in hospitality.

Furthermore many local governments place the burden of tax collection on hosts not Airbnb. A 2022 analysis by the National League of Cities an advocacy organization composed of city town and village leaders estimated that 82% of cities require hosts to remit taxes themselves while only 5% require the platform to do so on hosts’ behalf.

Hosts must now not only act as full-time customer service agents and hospitality experts but also navigate local regulations and master convoluted taxation laws.

Competition from management companies

The romantic notion of home sharing as a means for homeowners to pay their mortgages has given way to management companies inserting themselves and aiming to maximize profits. And small-time hosts can’t keep up with these corporate competitors.

A study of short-term rentals in the U.K. found that the number of listings managed by hosts with a single property dropped from 69% in 2015 to 39% in 2019. And data from the nonprofit Inside Airbnb suggests that only 39.1% of properties in Los Angeles are managed by single-property hosts.

These mega-hosts are able to operate at scale maximizing efficiency on everything from pricing adjustments to cleaning staff. Single-property hosts can’t keep up or are unwilling to deal with the hassle and are being elbowed out of the ecosystem.

Sept. 20 2020. (Pennsylvania National Guard)

Akamai researchers on Wednesday reported that based on a newly observed domain (NOD) dataset they have flagged almost 79 million domains as malicious in the first half of 2022.

The researchers say this equals approximately 13 million malicious domains per month representing 20.1% of all the NODs that successfully resolved.

In a blog post the Akamai researchers explained that whenever a domain name is queried for the first time in the last 60 days the researchers consider it an NOD. The NOD dataset lets the researchers zoom in on the “long tail” of DNS queries. This dataset is where to find freshly registered domain names typos and domains that are only very rarely queried on a global scale.

NOD data lets Akamai classify a new domain very early in the threat lifecycle. All of its NOD-based detection systems and rules are fully automated. The researchers say that once a new NOD gets identified the time needed for Akamai to classify it as malicious is measured in minutes — not hours or days. All of this gets done with no human intervention which lets Akamai mitigate the new DNS threats quickly according to the researchers.

“To put these numbers into context every month we intercept 13 million domains that are created with malicious purposes that resolve or go somewhere” said Stijn Tilborghs a senior data scientist at Akamai. “Based on the data that we see and with our current heuristic detection system this equates to 1 in 5 new domains being created for malicious purposes. From a defense perspective Akamai was able to flag these domains as malicious because of this NOD-based detection system. This allows carriers and ISP's to block these domains.""

Matthew Fulmer manager of cyber intelligence engineering at Deep Instinct said the data shows a trend that has been increasing exponentially over the past few years: domains are created with the intent of spreading or being used in malicious activities. Fulmer said these activities are often leveraged as a part of code telling a machine where to pull a malicious payload from developed into a phishing site with the intent of stealing credentials or even used as a contact point for a command-and-control beacon to report back around connectivity.

“These numbers are extremely significant as looking at the domains in question are random number-letter combinations which amounts to almost a ‘burner’ domain” Fulmer said. “They are created with the intent of malicious activity and once they are compromised or classified as malicious threat actors can just dump them and move to a new domain. For this reason alone you need to ensure that you have adequate layering in place for your defenses especially as the rate of false positives was 0.00042% (329 sites out of 79 million).”

Muralidharan Palanisamy chief solutions officer at AppViewX said Akamai’s detection is based on NODs which are essentially new DNS domains that appear on the internet. Palanisamy said with existing domains having some history and reputation identifying whether or not they are secure requires minimal effort. That being said Palanisamy said there’s a challenge in figuring out whether the new domains are malicious or not.

“Akamai’s NOD-based automated detection is a novel approach where they address and mitigate threats in the DNS layer way before the connection gets established to impact applications” Palanisamy said. “Because security is multi-faceted we have to rely on all weapons in our arsenal to identify the bad actors. Another related approach is Google’s Certificate transparency initiative which was able to identify and address compromised certificates domains and certificate authorities. However with regulatory authorities being compromised and state actors setting up their own regulations bad actors are able to bypass checks. This is where NODs will help in identifying the new domains that pop up by monitoring and tracking them.”

Mike Parkin senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber he’s not surprised that Akamai found so many throwaway malicious domains. Parkin said threat actors are constantly having to create new ones as the old ones are identified and either eliminated from the DNS system or blocked by security gateways.

“Ultimately some form of secure and validated DNS system should become the standard though there are already a number of tools that will at least provide warnings when a user tries to connect to a suspect domain” Parkin said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9ha2FtYWktdG8tZXhwYW5kLWxpbm9kZS1pbnRvLWEtZG96ZW4tbmV3LW1hcmtldHMtYnktbmV4dC15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akamai to expand Linode into a dozen new markets by next year,"The companies this week announced plans to add more than a dozen new Linode data centers – equipped with Linode’s full product suite of hosting services – across the US India Brazil Indonesia Japan Sweden Italy France and the Netherlands by the end of 2023.

Akamai is to expand Linode’s presence in more than a dozen markets over the next year and is planning to develop a new Edge compute offering.

However these are not new builds. Akamai told Protocol – and has confirmed to DCD – that it is looking to deploy in existing Akamai data centers where possible or “use locations that Akamai is already familiar with”.

“We’re really looking at locations where we can find the kind of network capacity the colo and the power that allow us to expand horizontally like you would expect from a hyperscaler” Shawn Michels Akamai’s vice president of product management for computing told the publication.

The first planned new location is targeted for Ashburn Virginia later this year with more to follow in the first half of 2023.

The companies are also targeting deployments in Amsterdam Chennai Chicago Delhi Jakarta Los Angeles Osaka Miami Paris Rome São Paulo Seattle and Stockholm. Specific details for each are set to be released in the future.

The companies are also aiming to launch a new Edge offering designed to ‘get basic compute capabilities into difficult-to-reach locations’ currently underserved by traditional cloud providers. These locations will be known “Distributed Sites” and Akamai & Linode have identified more than 50 cities where it intends to place them. Protocol describes these sites as similar to AWS Local Zones.

“The goal is to try to push data and try to push parts of the application as close to the user as possible” Michels said.

“In a core site … you would have things like database as a service and object storage and block storage and VMs and containers and GPUs [but] what we’re hearing from some of our customers is that in order to serve their audience as they build more distributed applications and as they move into things like microservices what they would like is VMs and a block storage offering in a more difficult-to-reach region where maybe the networking or maybe the data center infrastructure isn’t as robust as it is in other regions” he added.

Content Delivery Network (CDN) firm Akamai acquired cloud hosting company Linode for $900 million earlier this year. In a subsequent earnings call the companies said that together they would create 'the world’s most distributed compute platform – from cloud to Edge – making it easier for developers and businesses to build run and secure applications.""

Founded in 2003 Linode currently operates 11 data centers across America Canada Germany the UK India Japan Singapore and Australia. It does not appear to generally own the facilities outright - with its Atlanta data center actually a DataBank site Singapore presence in a Pacnet data center and Frankfurt locale a Telecity data center - and instead leases space from colocation and wholesale companies.

Akamai helped create the content delivery network (CDN) concept and now operates more than 275000 servers across 136 countries. In recent years it has tried to expand its CDN offering into a wider Edge platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FrYW1haS1uYW1lZC1hLXdlYi1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1maXJld2FsbC1sZWFkZXItYnktaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQtcmVzZWFyY2gtZmlybS0zMDE2MzQzNTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akamai Named a Web Application Firewall Leader by Independent Research Firm,"Customers Offer ""High Praise"" for Akamai App & API Protector Detection Capabilities and Dashboards

Podcast@Zacks.com

Welcome to Episode #330 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.

Every week host and Zacks stock strategist Tracey Ryniec will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week Tracey went solo to discuss how investors should get strategic even as the bear market churns on.

Instead of joining the bear market brigade why not focus on where things are still bullish? Where are analysts actually raising earnings estimates instead of cutting?

Now is the time to use the Zacks Rank to your advantage. It can be a great tool for uncovering hidden stock gems.

What’s the Zacks Rank?

The Zacks Rank is system that ranks over 4400 companies based on changes to analyst earnings estimates. The Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) is the highest and best rank. The Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) is the worst rank.

It is a computer algorithm that can change daily.

But rising earnings estimates especially in these type of bearish market conditions when earnings guidance is being cut more than raised can indicate that there is something special going on at a company.

How Hard is it To Make the List?

The Textile-Apparel industry has 19 companies including some of the biggest names in retail. But this industry has lagged as business has slowed due to inflationary pressures. After all do you really need to buy that new top or pants when you are paying $100 to fill up the gas tank?

Out of that group of 19 companies however there is just one that is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). And it’s not who you think it is.

1. Lululemon LULU

Lululemon is one of the strongest brands in retail. Not even the pandemic seemed to slow them down as consumers still wanted their yoga pants.

Lululemon is expected to grow earnings by 26.7% this year even with China’s economy facing disruptions due to the Zero COVID policy and a slowing economy. Analysts believe Lululemon will grow earnings another 16% next year.

But even with big earnings growth expected Lululemon is still just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It’s not the company with the #1 Rank in apparel.

Who is?

2. Oxford Industries OXM

Oxford Industries which owns Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer is the only company currently taking the top prize in the apparel industry.

Story continues

On Sep 19 Oxford announced it was acquiring Johnny Was a California boho vintage retail chain with 61 stores in 24 states. Oxford Industries expects it to be immediately accretive so it raised full year earnings guidance.

But Oxford also said that two-thirds of the raise was Johnny Was but one-third was strong quarter-to-date performance. It’s brands continue to resonate with consumers.

As a result analysts raised their earnings estimates to meet the new guidance. Earnings are expected to rise 31% this year. Oxford Industries is cheap with a forward P/E of 8.5.

The Zacks Rank uncovered a “story” with Oxford Industries that you might not have discovered otherwise.

The Zacks Rank can be a powerful tool during bear markets. It can uncover hidden gems.

3 Zacks #1 Rank Stocks

1. Albemarle ALB

The lithium producers are some of the few companies that have been raising guidance this year as lithium prices have tripled over the last year. Albemarle’s earnings are expected to rise 425% this year to $21.22 from $4.04 last year.

Shares of Albemarle are up 14% year-to-date bucking the negative market trend.

Albemarle is cheap with a forward P/E of 12.5.

Is it too late to buy Albemarle?

2. Livent LTHM

Livent describes itself as a lithium tech company. It’s stock is sure acting like a tech stock as shares are up 26.3% year-to-date.

Livent’s earnings are expected to jump 666% to $1.38 from $0.18 last year.

It trades with a forward P/E of 21.9.

Should Livent investors wait on the sidelines for a pull back or dive in?

3. Chesapeake Energy CHK

Chesapeake Energy is an energy exploration and production company. The explorers are in the top 13% of industries as earnings are surging due to high oil and natural gas prices.

Shares of Chesapeake Energy are up 42% year-to-date but are still dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 5.2.

Earnings are expected to soar another 46% next year.

Chesapeake Energy also pays a dividend and recently raised its base dividend by 10% to $2.20 per share. That’s a yield of 2.4%. But it also has paid out special dividends this year which makes the yield even higher.

Should this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) be on your short list?

(“Align”) (Nasdaq: ALGN) a leading global medical device company that designs manufactures and sells the Invisalign system of clear aligners iTero intraoral scanners and exocad CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry today introduced Invisalign Virtual Care AI its next generation remote monitoring solution with new artificial intelligence-assisted capabilities that streamline workflows for doctors and their staff. It includes features such as patient enrollment setup and review directly on the Invisalign Doctor Site without the need to use separate standalone solutions. Invisalign Virtual Care AI helps doctors remotely monitor Invisalign treatment progress based on their own pre-approved clinical settings and AI-assisted algorithms for Automatic Assessment calibrated to each doctor’s ClinCheck treatment features. AI-assisted Automated Notifications based on doctor settings guide patients to either advance to the next aligner stage if their treatment is tracking well or to stay on their current stage for longer or to contact their doctor if their treatment is not tracking.

Invisalign Virtual Care AI builds on the MedTech Breakthrough award winning Invisalign Virtual Care platform launched in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to help Invisalign doctors connect with patients remotely through the My Invisalign App to monitor treatment progress and ensure continuity of care of patients during Invisalign treatment. It offers several software features to create a seamless and intelligent single-platform experience. Part of the Invisalign Virtual Care AI solution is the AI-assisted Automated Notifications (Virtual Care 3.0) feature which is a registered medical device in some countries.

“Align is committed to continuous innovation in digital orthodontics and I am very excited about our next generation AI-assisted remote monitoring solution” said Raj Pudipeddi Align Technology chief product and marketing officer executive vice president and managing director Asia Pacific. “Invisalign Virtual Care AI is the only doctor-directed AI-assisted remote monitoring solution in the market that integrates with the Align Digital Platform enabling doctors to prioritize Invisalign treatment tracking exceptions. It creates a seamless and intelligent single-platform experience for Invisalign doctors and their staff through integration with the Invisalign Doctor Site without the need for a separate portal and login or expensive third-party workarounds. In addition since it’s part of the Align Digital Platform and integrated with ClinCheck software it incorporates attributes from the approved treatment plan into the assessment such as tooth type size shape etc. Further it automatically assesses patient-submitted photos through our My Invisalign App sending instructions back to patients on their smartphone in as little as one hour.”

“Invisalign Virtual Care AI is another great example of how we are using digital technology to connect doctors and their patients to facilitate even greater continuity of care and deliver a streamlined experience” said Dr. Mitra Derakhshan Align senior vice president global clinical. “Aligner fit and seating are important clinical indicators of Invisalign treatment progress tracking and compliance. The AI-assisted Automatic Assessment algorithms measure and highlight aligner spaces based on doctor approved settings and AI-assisted Automated Notifications inform patients on actions such as whether to advance to the next stage stay on their current stage or contact their doctor for further instructions. These AI-assisted technologies integrated with human confirmation enable practices to prioritize Invisalign treatment tracking exceptions.”

“I initially began using Invisalign Virtual Care at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure continuity of care for my Invisalign patients” said Dr. David R. Boschken an orthodontist and Align Technology Global Faculty member located in Los Altos California. “The new AI-assisted algorithms in Invisalign Virtual Care AI have elevated the remote monitoring experience for me and my patients. Automatic Assessment provides me with objective measurement of aligner spaces the single most important indicator of Invisalign treatment tracking in my practice while Automated Notifications advise patients of their progress in less than one hour which in turn enables me to focus on treatment tracking exceptions. And since Invisalign Virtual Care AI is integrated with the Align Digital Platform I don’t have to log into a separate portal or use third party remote monitoring services. This efficiency has enabled me to save chair time and expand the geographic reach of my practice. It has given me the confidence to enroll over 1000 of my Invisalign patients into Invisalign Virtual Care AI from teens and young adults to seniors – this is the new way to follow Invisalign treatments for orthodontic practices.”

“Invisalign Virtual Care AI has transformed how I follow the treatment progress of my Invisalign patients” said Dr. Jan Einfeldt a GP dentist located in Kent United Kingdom. “Tooth movement using Invisalign clear aligners is often the first step in a smile makeover which may require a combination of procedures such as implants veneers and crowns so it is critical to keep treatment progress on track. By using my pre-approved preferences and automatically integrating attributes of my approved ClinCheck treatment plan such as tooth type shape size pontics etc. the AI algorithms help determine aligner fit and advise patients to advance to the next aligner tray or stay on their current tray for longer to ensure the desired movements take effect. Invisalign Virtual Care AI is now the gold standard of follow up across all procedures in my practice that include Invisalign treatment.”

AI-assisted Remote Monitoring Fully Integrated with the Align Digital Platform

Invisalign Virtual Care AI is integrated with the Align Digital Platform which includes the Invisalign Doctor Site ClinCheck treatment plans and the My Invisalign App. No separate portal or login is required since remote monitoring is managed directly on the Invisalign Doctor Site which benefits doctors and their staff. Similarly patients can use their My Invisalign App without the need to download a separate app for remote monitoring.

AI-assisted Photo Capture: Easy capture of clinically relevant photos via the My Invisalign App for patients with a next-generation user interface and intelligent real-time photo guidance. Patients send photos with every aligner change and receive progress notifications on their My Invisalign App. No separate remote monitoring app is required.

Patients send photos with every aligner change and receive progress notifications on their My Invisalign App. No separate remote monitoring app is required. AI-assisted Automatic Assessment* : Automatic assessment measures and highlights the size of aligner spaces based on doctor settings. Objective and doctor-directed: AI uses each doctor’s settings to objectively measure aligner spaces. Doctors can customize settings at a clinic level or for individual patients. Personalized and integrated with ClinCheck treatment plan attributes: Virtual Care AI assessment automatically integrates tooth type shape and size from the doctor-approved ClinCheck treatment plan. Tooth-specific detail: Aligner spaces are measured and highlighted individually for each tooth. This enables doctors to quickly hone-in on problem areas where teeth do not correctly fit into the tray. Any exceptions to treatment progress such as aligner fit or a tooth that is not moving as expected are flagged for doctor review helping ensure patient treatments are being monitored between in-office visits.

: Automatic assessment measures and highlights the size of aligner spaces based on doctor settings. AI-assisted Automated Notification: Automated Notifications are delivered to patients through the My Invisalign App in ~1 hour based on doctor settings. Patients are instructed to advance to the next tray if their treatment is tracking well or to stay on their current aligner or to contact their doctor if their treatment is off track.

Climate tech is a hot topic among venture capitalists with investment deals reaching $19 billion in the first half of 2022 according to database Climate Tech VC. Although funding decreased compared to the first half of 2021 due to a downturn in late-stage deals the number of deals overall increased with a greater backing of early-stage companies.

The market is also diversifying with more investment in technologies to tackle environmental issues across different industries including manufacturing and the built environment adding to climate tech funding in the more established sectors of transport energy and food and land use.

Yet if we are to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as scientists advocate does more need to be done on the financial front? Analysts at high-tech bank Silicon Valley Bank have calculated that under current climate policies the world will be emitting 55 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2030 and that this figure will need to be reduced to 25 gigatons in order for the temperature threshold not to be surpassed. They have forecast a need for around $5.6 trillion a year in investments overall to make these targets achievable — $2.1 trillion per year more than previously expected.

We have seen the costs of wind and solar power come down over the past decade as funding for innovative technologies has scaled up production. Now more emphasis needs to be placed on developing a broader span of tech solutions to yield sustainable practices on a wider scale.

Green hydrogen is crucial to the energy transition

Green hydrogen is a key focus in the battle to stop climate change. It is vital to form part of international energy transition strategies as it is a fuel source that does not produce emissions. Formed from the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources green hydrogen is the cleanest of all hydrogen color types. By comparison gray and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added then it will be termed blue hydrogen.

Hydrogen Production Process. Image courtesy of Pall Corporation.

For green hydrogen the electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field generated typically by wind or solar power. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.

Three types of electrolyzers can be used — alkaline (AEL) polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEC). AEL is the most widely used in industrial applications but drawbacks include lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Use of PEM is increasing because it has fewer drawbacks but it is expensive compared to AEL. SOEC is a technology with great potential but is still in the early stages of commercialization.

Whichever electrolysis technology is used the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid liquid and gaseous contaminants. In this process the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity are extremely stringent. Typically concentrations between 2000 to 6000 ppm (parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.

Purity is created via filtration

This gap between outputs and purity standards is why predominant AEL systems require further optimization to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.

After hydrolysis the liquid-and-gas mixture needs to be cooled separated and compressed; this can be done with gravity separators mist eliminators pads filter vane separators and liquid/gas coalescers. The hydrogen is then fed into a catalytic reactor to remove any contaminating oxygen.

Solid contaminants originating from oxidation in pipes and equipment must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines — material that attracts and holds liquid gas or solute — are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released contaminating the gas. To remove these contaminants disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.

The final step is the efficient storage of the hydrogen once it is produced. It can be compressed and stored in tanks pumped into salt caverns or converted into liquid ammonia using the Haber-Bosch Process. Throughout each of these processes the gas can become contaminated with liquids solids or gases (if transported in natural gas pipelines). The contaminants will need to be removed to meet the end use specifications.

Investment to make continuous improvement

In order to make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale there will need to be more power available from solar and wind farms along with enough large electrolyzers to carry out the chemical process. Investment in new electrolyzer facilities is underway by many traditional oil and gas suppliers that are diversifying their output as well as by environmental technology companies.

Silicon Valley Bank expects that by the time it issues its next annual report on climate tech in 2023 many venture capitalists will have stayed with companies they have already backed and continue with mid-to-late-stage funding where the return on investment might be reduced. They may of course also keep investing in emerging enterprises where the risks and potential rewards are greater.

It is this financial commitment the world needs — along with legislation and practical measures by industry and consumers — that will help drive progress on climate change. The scaling up of green hydrogen production is key to making energy supply sustainable for the future. Funding the development of technology is both necessary and an opportunity for financiers to see a ROI. The ultimate beneficiaries should be our planet and communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc3BpbmFsbmV3c2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tL3N1cmdhbGlnbi1leHBhbmRzLWZvcnRpbGluay1wcm9kdWN0LWxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surgalign expands Fortilink product line,"Surgalign has announced the expansion of its Fortilink product portfolio with the introduction and commercial launch of a new family of interbody fusion devices featuring its TiPlus technology.

The new implants include Fortilink-A with TiPlus technology for anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) procedures; Fortilink-TC and Fortilink-TS with TiPlus technology for posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) procedures; and Fortilink-C with TiPlus technology for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures.

The new family of 3D-printed titanium alloy interbody cages are fully porous and designed using the benefits of 3D-printed manufacturing without compromise of clinical requirements say Surgalign. They were designed with direct input from leading medical practitioners with a goal to incorporate characteristics surgeons seek in a titanium interbody fusion device the company adds. The system features a wide variety of implant sizes.

Jon White an orthopaedic spine surgeon at Hoag Orthopedic Institute (Irvine USA) said: “TiPlus is a great new offering that significantly bolsters the interbody solutions I can offer to my patients based on their specific clinical need. The acid-etched surface and optimised pore size allows for both bone ongrowth and ingrowth providing confidence in achieving favourable patient outcomes.”

Aaron Creek a spine surgeon at The Neck and Back Institute of Florida (Destin USA) added: “The expansion of the Fortilink system to include a 3D-printed titanium implant in addition to the existing TETRAfuse 3D-printed polymer option is a unique and efficient solution. Utilising the well-designed Fortilink instrumentation—but with two implant offerings in different biomaterials—allows me to better customise the treatment of my patients.”

Kierzek

Special to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

When most people think of the Dairy State they’re typically thinking cow milk. Yet there are sheep milk producers here including Darlene and Steve Eckerman in Antigo.

Dairy is at the heart of their story including the fact that they met at a dairy workshop in Green Bay decades ago. Today they raise lambs for meat and milk sheep at Eckerman Sheep Company. Giving a nod to Darlene’s regional roots and third-generation connection to Phlox Butter plant and Phlox Creamery the couple named their sheep milk cheese brand Phlox Farms.

Their award-winning sheep milk cheeses have received recognition every year and they’re shipped across the country. This year the 2019 Ewemazing placed second in the mixed milk category at the World Dairy Expo’s 2022 Championship Dairy Product Contest.

World Dairy Expo will be held Oct. 2-7 at the Alliant Energy Center 1919 Alliant Energy Center Way Madison. Tickets are $15 daily.

On Oct. 4 all first-place winners will be auctioned and a portion of the proceeds will fund scholarships for students pursuing dairy careers. For information on the auction call (608) 836-3336.

Back in 2017 the Eckermans also won with their 2016 Lovely Lamb. Yet they wondered what happened to cheeses that weren’t auctioned off including second- and third-place winners. For the past 19 years all second- and third-place winners have been donated to Madison Area Technical College’s culinary school. Students prepare new recipes with the products which are then served Oct. 4 during a reception for the expo's auction.

Darlene spoke for the couple.

Generations of Phlox

We picked the Phlox label Phlox Farms because I grew up here. My grandfather started the Phlox Butter plant and Phlox Creamery. My dad continued. We went with Phlox Farms for our cheese. My grandpa started this in 1912. I’m third generation.

Our son Chris is now a cheesemaker and cheese grader. He’s working in Kansas at a brand-new cheese plant there.

A match made with milk

Steve was working in Wittenberg in the Morning Glory plant a butter plant now Nueske's. He came here from Iowa had a degree in food science. That was his first job in 1975.

In 1976 I graduated from UW-Madison studying food science and dairy. My best job offer was my dad. … That fall we both went to a dairy workshop in Green Bay. I was the only female in the room didn't bother me because my professors were all teaching so I knew them. Steve called a week later later and asked me out.

Changes in the cheese world

There are far more women in cheesemaking now than when I started and they are holding far more positions of responsibility. When I started they'd say things like “We'd interview you but we won’t hire you because it is too dangerous …”

Cows vs. sheep

Sheep are smaller to handle than cows. Steve’s family … in Brookings South Dakota had meat sheep. Steve spent the summers with them.

We started in 1989 with fair market sheep. That evolved as we attended a lot of meetings. Until the children got older we didn't get into the milking. We became part of Wisconsin Dairy Sheep Co-op back then.

Educating consumers

There is an education aspect of it. Sheep’s milk the proteins are more digestible. All milk has lactose but when you make cheese it breaks it down as well. I know a number of people handle the sheep cheese well.

Wisconsin has the most number of milking sheep and that isn’t very many. We do have the new SDAW Sheep Dairy Association of Wisconsin and that would be a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more. …

When we lost (the dairy sheep research program at) Spooner and they closed that (in 2016) it was horrendous. They were the drive behind any of the research and bringing in new products. It was the only research station here and I believe the only dairy sheep station in all of North America and they closed it down.

The difference is in the details

Sheep’s milk is richer sweeter and creamier. There is nothing like a good sheep cheese. Our cheeses are aged and it is like eating candy.

There are places that make the fresh sheep cheese but ours are aged. You have to remember with sheep cheese you get so little milk out of a sheep compared to goat and cows.

No two cheeses are the same

Our 2017 it is also called Ewemazing but it doesn’t taste anything like the 2019. Our cheeses are done by years and names.

Every other year we do the same formula but because it is artisan cheese it will taste different. In 2017 we won our class with Lovel Lamb. Last year in the same contest the 2018 Lovely Lamb placed first as well for World Dairy Products.

Art and culture

Steve’s background is cultures so he has an inside track on (cheese) cultures and how to put them together to make a good cheese.

Biggest source of sales

Our sheep cheese is sold coast to coast. We ship a lot of gift box cheese out at Christmas and many sales come from the Oshkosh market. We will be there again (Nov. 26 and Dec. 17 from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the Oshkosh Arena 1212 S. Main St. Oshkosh).

We also sell online. Shipping is not that bad for the cheese because that is smaller pieces and in the fall and winter it is better because of the weather.

Making their cheese

We have to do 6000 pounds so we get 72 wheels.

This is artisan cheese. We are a plant but we do not make the cheese here. We have our own recipe we have developed but we have to find a cheese plant to make our cheese. Any other state we could do our own right on site. So we partner with a cheese plant.

We found a great cheesemaker Katie Hedrich out of LaClare (Creamery) and that last batch she did was the 2019.

What she wants you to know

Sheep milk cheese is amazing. We think it is the best cheese out there. You have to find a good sheep milk cheese and try it. Ours are very good but it is limited-supply artisan cheese. It is sold in small pieces. It is expensive because a sheep does not give very much milk.

Savor small bites

People ask what I cook with it. I don’t. I might make a fancy grilled cheese but otherwise it is a cheese you snack with wine or beer or serve at a party as appetizers. It is a special-occasion treat.

Why it’s worth it

A sheep will give five to 10 pounds of milk and some farmers can get 10. We don’t. Cows will give 72 pounds at a time. So why choose sheep? Because the cheese tastes so good.

Plan ahead

Sheep only milk January through October. They are seasonal. Typically because of the tax work I do we lamb after tax season.

More than cheese

We started selling in Oshkosh because my daughter Patricia and my son-in-law have a restaurant there called Manila Resto. They usually do these 100 pound pigs and make lechon. It is phenomenal.

They make Filipino food and sushi there and it is so good. We had our 45th anniversary celebration there this weekend because it is central for most of the family. I asked if they could do the lechon with a lamb. Why would I pay for a pig when we have lamb? Chef Ninoy had never cooked lamb this way but it turned out so tender.

We sell a lot of our lamb. People often say “I don't like lamb” and I say you haven’t had ours. Our lamb meat tastes great. We ship that frozen. We did the lamb way before the cheese started in 2016.

Milk and money matters

I do taxes for farms. I have a sheep farm that is doing amazingly well just milking. The cheese is an added value which is why we went into the cheese. You make more money selling your own product. You can make a living doing this. You need an outside job or a lot of savings to get started.

Sheep science

One of the things about sheep’s milk why it is so easily digestible the fat is integrated so finely into the milk globules the cream does not rise to the top. You can also freeze it as it does not separate the same way as goat or cow milk.

Sheep milk can be frozen and that's how we started. We’d freeze it in bags ship it to New York and they’d thaw it. … Sartori cheese is 10 miles from us but we don’t have enough to supply them on any given day yet. We have enough sheep but we’re not milking enough yet.

Acres of corn stand tall on both sides of a narrow country road in northwest Indiana. It’s late August and the corn is tasseling its golden crown coated in dew droplets that are glinting off the morning summer sun. Then there is a different gleam on the horizon one that’s brighter.

Sprouting out of the corn like a super crop are four arrays of solar panels standing 20 feet high and towering above the stalks growing below. They look both out of place technology amid nature and as though they have always been there. After all both the corn and the panels are harvesting the sun.

“Either way they are storing solar energy” said Mitch Tuinstra a professor of plant breeding and genetics at Purdue University. “One is storing them as electrons and the other in the plants.”

Tuinstra is one of several Purdue faculty and graduate students studying these solar arrays on the university’s research field just a few miles off campus in West Lafayette Ind.

Farmland is well suited for solar development of all kinds for the same reasons it’s good for growing crops – it’s largely flat drains well and gets lots of sun. Grazing land for animals like sheep can also be a good fit for solar. But what makes these Purdue research panels different is that they haven’t taken farmland out of production – they’re built overtop of the corn itself.

It’s a practice known as “agrivoltaics” or “agrisolar” where active farming and solar happen in the same place instead of separately. The approach brings many complications that researchers are still trying to address – but they see big benefits in trying to hone in on best practices.

Farmers who want to lease their land for solar as an extra income source will reap even more economic benefits if that land stays in production — and some approaches to agrivoltaics may even help the crops themselves researchers say.

“We want to see if we can devise systems that have minimal losses in terms of crop productivity while maximizing their electricity output” Tuinstra said.

Moreover he said researchers want to see how the co-location strategy could be a salve to a growing strain between solar and farming in the Corn Belt — where residents and towns are pushing back on what they see as industrialization in rural communities. That includes communities in Wisconsin where University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers are working with Alliant Energy to pursue similar research on university-owned land near Stoughton.

Solar potential in farm country

The stakes behind this effort are high: Solar power has a key role to play in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions chiefly from fossil fuel-fired power plants that are driving the increasingly deadly effects of climate change.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that by the year 2050 – when the Paris Climate Accords say the world must reach net-zero carbon emissions to avert further climate catastrophe – solar generation will account for 20% of net electricity generation in the U.S. up from a mere 3% in 2020. The Biden administration is investing to get to that point including billions under the Inflation Reduction Act for solar production and investment tax credits that some analyses predict will kickstart massive growth in the sector.

According to Tuinstra these new panels can’t all be concentrated in the desert regions of the Southwest for instance because it would be highly inefficient to transmit that energy throughout the rest of the country. Instead there needs to be localized buildout so that utilities and consumers can reap the economic and reliability benefits of renewables close to home.

A 2021 Department of Energy report concluded that by 2050 land equal to a maximum of 0.5% of the contiguous United States’ surface area would be required for solar projects to help meet climate change goals. By comparison farms account for approximately 40% of all land in the United States. Still that 0.5% of U.S. land would represent nearly 9.5 million actual acres close to that of all the corn and soybeans planted in Indiana alone.

That federal report said a focus on “disturbed lands” such as capped landfills and old parking lots could help prevent over-reliance on “high-value lands in current use.”

But in the Midwest and the Corn Belt the vast majority of viable land that could be used for photovoltaic energy generation is tied up in agriculture – specifically row crops Tuinstra said or corn and soy in much of the Midwest and wheat and barley further west.

Concern for tradition

For some residents in areas where farmland is being eyed for this kind of conversion solar is viewed as an eyesore and a threat to crops and the agrarian character of their communities.

In late August the corn surrounding the Palo Community Center in Palo Iowa was more than six feet tall. Farmers would harvest the crop over the next month or so just like any regular season.

But this year something else joined them in the field: signs with a red X through the words “industrial solar.” In the community center residents waited to hear the fate of a proposed 200-megawatt solar installation that would be sited on agricultural land near town – not agrivoltaics but a more traditional approach where the panels would not sit above any crops.

Some attendees supported the projects; many condemned them most citing objections to taking cropland out of production. In the end the complaints didn’t matter: The projects were approved the following week.

When several meeting attendees were asked if layering solar arrays over active farmland could be a viable compromise many were skeptical.

“I doubt it very seriously” said Robert Little a 74-year-old electrician. He worked on farms his whole life and comes from a farm family. Agrivoltaics could put those generational practices in jeopardy he said.

“The biggest concern would be old family traditions” Little said. “And the other conflict is that I don’t think it could ever work.”

Similar concerns have popped up in Wisconsin. In Iowa County for instance Invenergy’s Badger Hollow Solar Farm whose first 150 megawatts went online in December 2021 sparked local debate between farmers some of whom welcomed the benefits of leasing their land and residents who feared the 5.5-square-mile project would make the area a “solar wasteland.”

Communities and counties across the Midwest are saying no to solar — like in Indiana where nearly a third of counties have ordinances restricting if not prohibiting renewable projects. Further south a Louisiana parish recently approved a commercial solar moratorium in an area that’s home to both dense petrochemical industry and sugarcane fields.

Better together

This skepticism is a big motivator for researchers who see agrivoltaics as a win-win approach – crops and panels working in concert on the same sites at the same time instead of competing.

A tripod with equipment to measure light and shadows is seen in a corn and soybean field on Aug. 31 2022 in West Lafayette Ind. Purdue University is doing research on the best designs for agrivoltaics the co-location of crops and solar power. (Kelly Wilkinson / Indianapolis Star)

But there are unresolved challenges – like the shadows produced by solar panels. That’s part of what the team at Purdue is studying Tuinstra said to model the optimal spacing between arrays along with technology to keep excessive shadows from interfering with crop production.

To that end farmers in the Midwest may have an advantage over their peers in the Southwest because solar arrays tend to work more efficiently in less heat-intensive environments said Dennis Bowman a digital agriculture specialist at Illinois Extension.

“Having a cooler environment (with) plants underneath the solar panel that are transpiring moisture and providing a cooling effect will actually help increase the efficiency of the panels” he said.

One federal program is exploring different types of agrivoltaics through roughly two dozen projects across the country. Some such as in the southwest and northeast are looking at co-locating solar with specialty crops such as lettuces tomatoes and berries. These smaller plants are better suited for an agrivoltaic environment because they benefit from shade and require smaller equipment for planting and harvesting.

But since farmers across Indiana Illinois and Iowa plant roughly 56 million acres of corn and soy each year versus just a few hundred thousand acres of specialty crops professors like Tuinstra and Bowman want to know if these row crops can work for solar too. At first glance it seems unlikely: Planting and harvesting require more sun and bigger equipment.

So some studies are also looking at how to engineer different types of seeds and crops that are better suited for growing under solar. And Tuinstra said solar companies are getting involved reaching out for advice on designing a system that can fit around planting and harvesting.

But trying to optimize both crops and technology is putting researchers and developers in a chicken-and-egg loop: To get funding for projects and lower development costs you need years of proof that they work. But to build those proofs of concept you need money and affordability.

‘A different mindset’

Midwest Agrivoltaic Systems and its CEO Andrew Poor are doing their own research on developing cost-effective solar panel substructures – known as racking – that stand taller and farther apart than normal arrays enough to accommodate row crops and farm equipment.

This need for additional materials and special designs is one reason that anecdotally Poor said agrivoltaics tend to cost more than traditional arrays.

But there is no “average” cost for agrivoltaics yet Poor said because very few large-scale projects have been completed in the U.S. And now rising demand and limited availability of solar panels themselves has driven prices up as well said Bowman.

“It’s the Catch-22” Poor said. “I’m always looking for funding.”

Poor’s company is currently working on smaller agrivoltaics projects with partners willing to pay for the cost of materials hoping to eventually ramp up to more expansive production as data rolls in. But it’s tough to attract development partners in a field that remains relatively unproven.

“They seem just as leery as the farmers are when it comes to signing up for a project” said Tyler Lloyd the solar operations director of Midwest Agrivoltaic Systems.

Still not every farmer is opposed. Those with combinations of row crops and livestock have proved more receptive to the idea of agrivoltaics Bowman said. Newer farmers less tied to traditional growing and harvesting tactics may also be interested in the tech.

“The trend has been to get this big equipment to farm a lot of acres and to farm it fast in a timely fashion to get the maximum yields. And it may take a different mindset” to see solar proliferate on conventional farmland he said.

Social and economic scientists on the Purdue research team are researching concerns surrounding agrivoltaics and how to address them with farmers using facts Tuinstra said.

“If the communities are concerned philosophically [and saying] ‘We don’t want to see these arrays in our space’ that’s entirely valid” he said. “What the social science and economics groups need to be able to say is ‘This is the value of having the system this is what it does to your farms this is how it improves sustainability of these communities.’”

For agrivoltaics to win a place in the typical farmer’s heart — and their fields — some attendees at the Palo Iowa meetings said they’ll have to see it to believe it.

“There’s no way it’s gonna work. There’s no way” said Doug Hanover a 62-year-old carpenter who started working on farms as a teenager. “I’d want to see it proven.”

According to Tuinstra that’s exactly what researchers are trying to do.

Miller / The Gazette and Joshua Rosenberg / The Lens Wisconsin Watch <br />September 27 2022</p> <p>Acres of corn stand tall on both sides of a narrow country road in northwest Indiana. It’s late August and the corn is tasseling its golden crown coated in dew droplets that are glinting off the morning summer sun. Then there is a different gleam on the horizon one that’s brighter.</p> <p>Sprouting out of the corn like a super crop are four arrays of solar panels standing 20 feet high and towering above the stalks growing below. They look both out of place technology amid nature and as though they have always been there. After all both the corn and the panels are harvesting the sun.</p> <p>“Either way they are storing solar energy” said Mitch Tuinstra a professor of plant breeding and genetics at Purdue University. “One is storing them as electrons and the other in the plants.”</p> <p>Tuinstra is one of several Purdue faculty and graduate students studying these solar arrays on the university’s research field just a few miles off campus in West Lafayette Ind. </p> <p>Farmland is well suited for solar development of all kinds for the same reasons it’s good for growing crops – it’s largely flat drains well and gets lots of sun. Grazing land for animals like sheep can also be a good fit for solar. But what makes these Purdue research panels different is that they haven’t taken farmland out of production – they’re built overtop of the corn itself. </p> <p>It’s a practice known as “agrivoltaics” or “agrisolar” where active farming and solar happen in the same place instead of separately. The approach brings many complications that researchers are still trying to address – but they see big benefits in trying to hone in on best practices. </p> <p>Farmers who want to <a href=""https://www.wpr.org/we-farm-sun-some-wisconsin-dairy-farmers-solar-energy-new-source-income"">lease their land for solar as an extra income source</a> will reap even more economic benefits if that land stays in production — and some approaches to agrivoltaics may even help the crops themselves researchers say. </p> <p>“We want to see if we can devise systems that have minimal losses in terms of crop productivity while maximizing their electricity output” Tuinstra said. </p> <p>Moreover he said researchers want to see how the co-location strategy could be a salve to a growing strain between solar and farming in the Corn Belt — where residents and towns are pushing back on what they see as industrialization in rural communities.<strong> </strong>That includes communities in Wisconsin where <a href=""https://sustainability.wisc.edu/strategic-initiatives/renewable-energy/kegonsa-research-campus/"">University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers are working with Alliant Energy</a> to pursue similar research on university-owned land near Stoughton.</p> <h3><strong>Solar potential in farm country</strong></h3> <p>The stakes behind this effort are high: Solar power has a key role to play in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions chiefly from fossil fuel-fired power plants that are driving the increasingly deadly effects of climate change. </p> <figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/purdue-corn-panels-771x450.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1271416"" /><figcaption>Experimental solar panels stand over crops of soybeans and corn on Aug. 31 2022 in West Lafayette Ind. where Purdue University researchers are studying best practices for agrivoltaics the co-location of solar energy with active farmland.

The Biden administration is investing to get to that point including billions under the Inflation Reduction Act for solar production and investment tax credits that <a href=""https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-04.pdf"">some analyses predict</a> will kickstart massive growth in the sector. </p> <p>According to Tuinstra these new panels can’t all be concentrated in the desert regions of the Southwest for instance because it would be highly inefficient to transmit that energy throughout the rest of the country. Instead there needs to be localized buildout so that utilities and consumers can reap the economic and reliability benefits of renewables close to home. </p> <p>A <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-09/Solar%20Futures%20Study.pdf"">2021 Department of Energy report</a> concluded that by 2050 land equal to a maximum of 0.5% of the contiguous United States’ surface area would be required for solar projects to help meet climate change goals. By comparison farms <a href=""https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2019/2017Census_Farms_Farmland.pdf"">account for approximately 40% of all land</a> in the United States. Still that 0.5% of U.S. land would represent nearly 9.5 million actual acres close to that of all the corn and soybeans planted in Indiana alone. </p> <p>That federal report said a focus on “disturbed lands” such as capped landfills and old parking lots could help prevent over-reliance on “high-value lands in current use.” </p> <p>But in the Midwest and the Corn Belt the vast majority of viable land that could be used for photovoltaic energy generation is tied up in agriculture – specifically row crops Tuinstra said or corn and soy in much of the Midwest and wheat and barley further west. </p> <h3><strong>Concern for tradition</strong></h3> <p>For some residents in areas where farmland is being eyed for this kind of conversion solar is viewed as an eyesore and a threat to crops and the agrarian character of their communities.</p> <p>In late August the corn surrounding the Palo Community Center in Palo Iowa was more than six feet tall. Farmers would harvest the crop over the next month or so just like any regular season. </p> <p>But this year something else joined them in the field: signs with a red X through the words “industrial solar.” In the community center residents waited to hear the fate of a proposed 200-megawatt solar installation that would be sited on agricultural land near town – not agrivoltaics but a more traditional approach where the panels would not sit above any crops.</p> <figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/palo-solar-sign-gazette-771x514.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1271418"" /><figcaption>A sign opposing industrial solar energy is seen at the edge of a cornfield in Palo Iowa on Sept. 8 2022 near the site of a recently approved 200-megawatt project.

In the end the complaints didn’t matter: <a href=""https://www.thegazette.com/news/palo-solar-projects-approved-with-final-supervisor-vote/"">The projects were approved</a> the following week. </p> <p>When several meeting attendees were asked if layering solar arrays over active farmland could be a viable compromise many were skeptical.</p> <p>“I doubt it very seriously” said Robert Little a 74-year-old electrician. He worked on farms his whole life and comes from a farm family. Agrivoltaics could put those generational practices in jeopardy he said. </p> <p>“The biggest concern would be old family traditions” Little said. “And the other conflict is that I don't think it could ever work.”</p> <p>Similar concerns have popped up in Wisconsin. In Iowa County for instance Invenergy’s Badger Hollow Solar Farm whose first 150 megawatts went online in December 2021 <a href=""https://wisconsinwatch.org/2019/01/massive-wisconsin-solar-proposal-splits-farmers-and-clean-energy-fans/"">sparked local debate</a> between farmers some of whom welcomed the benefits of leasing their land and residents who feared the 5.5-square-mile project would make the area a “solar wasteland.”</p> <p>Communities and counties across the Midwest are saying no to solar — like in Indiana where nearly a third of counties have ordinances restricting if not prohibiting renewable projects. Further south a Louisiana parish recently <a href=""https://thelensnola.org/2022/08/18/st-james-parish-approves-solar-farm-moratorium/"">approved a commercial solar moratorium</a> in an area that’s home to both dense petrochemical industry and sugarcane fields.</p> <h3><strong>Better together</strong></h3> <p>This skepticism is a big motivator for researchers who see agrivoltaics as a win-win approach – crops and panels working in concert on the same sites at the same time instead of competing. </p> <figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/purdue-solar-sensors-771x954.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1271419"" /><figcaption>A tripod with equipment to measure light and shadows is seen in a corn and soybean field on Aug. 31 2022 in West Lafayette Ind.

Public interest organization Consumer Watchdog (CW) has called on California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to deny Allstate’s request for a 6.9% auto insurance rate increase and to instead pressure the carrier to return more of its pandemic-era premium windfall to the Golden State’s drivers.

The new rates filed by Allstate in March would affect more than 900000 policyholders and generate an overall $165 million in additional premium per year according to the organization.

In a September 22 letter to Lara CW senior staff attorney Pamela Pressley and staff attorney Daniel L. Sternberg contend that the rate application includes a “discriminatory two-tiered rating system” under which “specialized professionals” would be charged a 4% lower rate. Included under “specialized” professions are education or library science science engineering and information technology according to Allstate documents filed with the CDI.

“This system is illegal under Proposition 103 and the Commissioner’s regulations which do not permit the use of occupation and education as rating factors” the letter contends.

Proposition 103 also known as the Insurance Rate Reduction and Reform Act states in part “Rates and premiums for an automobile insurance policy as described in subdivision (a) of Section 660 shall be determined by application of the following factors in decreasing order of importance:

“(1) The insured’s driving safety record.

“(2) The number of miles he or she drives annually.

“(3) The number of years of driving experience the insured has had.

“(4) Those other factors that the commissioner may adopt by regulation and that have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss. The regulations shall set forth the respective weight to be given each factor in determining automobile rates and premiums. Notwithstanding any other provision of law the use of any criterion without approval shall constitute unfair discrimination.”

CW argues that low-income and minority drivers are especially harmed by Allstate’s “unfairly discriminatory occupation-based rating system” and that voters enacted Proposition 103 “to stop this kind of unfair rate discrimination based on income or race.”

The letter also calls on Lara to hold a public hearing “to determine the amount of additional premium overcharges that Allstate has yet to return to California policyholders based on their reduced driving” while COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders were in effect.

On October 5 2021 Lara ordered Allstate Mercury and CSAA to return to drivers more of the excess profits collected from them during the pandemic or face legal action. An analysis by the California Department of Insurance (DOI) of new data showed that these three companies “have the greatest gap between what they initially refunded drivers and what they should have refunded to provide proper premium relief to their policyholders since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic” the insurance commissioner said at the time.

CW said the order “confirmed that ‘the PPA policyholders of Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company … should have received substantial additional PPA premium refunds or credits.’ But to date you have taken no further action publicly to ensure that Allstate’s policyholders receive the refunds they deserve.”

According to CW’s analysis Allstate has so far provided premium credits totaling less than half of the amount that the carrier “overcharged customers during that time period leaving hundreds of millions of dollars still owed.”

CW’s investigation showed that insurers raked in a $5.5 billion windfall because a vast majority of Californians drove far less in 2020. So far insurance companies have returned more than $2 billion in premium relief to California drivers.

Lara’s ability to enforce his order was called into doubt on Oct. 29 2021 when a California appeals court ruled that he had no authority to order State Farm to pay more than $100 million in refunds to Californians who the commissioner found were overcharged for homeowners condo and renters coverage.

In the case State Farm General Insurance Company v. Lara et al. the California Court of Appeal rejected the commissioner’s contention that the state’s Proposition 103 gives him the authority to order rate refunds as part of his responsibility to ensure that Californians are charged fair rates.

CW filed an appeal with the California Supreme Court which declined to review the lower court’s ruling.

(AP) — Top U.S. insurance companies and associations say California is risking a crisis in the nation’s largest automobile insurance market by refusing to approve any rate increases for more than two years since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The companies already are cutting back and say they can’t continue operating at a loss while Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara delays rate cases filed by companies representing three-quarters of the California market. Allstate Geico Kemper Liberty Mutual and State Farm all reported paying more in claims than they collected in California premiums in the first half of the year though they were profitable as recently as last year.

It’s part of Lara’s effort to compensate consumers who he says were overcharged during the pandemic’s early months when traffic all but disappeared after California imposed the nation’s first stay-home order. His office couldn’t say how much it thinks insurers still owe but the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog puts the amount at more than $3 billion.

“Data we collected directly from the insurance companies themselves shows many of them failed to fully return premiums that they overcharged consumers” said Deputy Insurance Commissioner Michael Soller. Part of the department’s effort is “to make it right for consumers who continue to have been overcharged on premiums during the pandemic.”

But a state appeals court ruled last year that Lara can’t impose “retroactive rates and refunds.” The state Supreme Court declined review and while Lara’s office interprets the ruling narrowly insurers say it’s a blanket ban on his attempts to require further refunds.

The dispute comes as Lara runs for reelection against Republican Robert Howell who is not expected to pose a serious threat to Lara’s re-election.

“The commissioner is an elected official and he’s trying to serve his constituents in a way that does not favor market forces” said David Russell a professor of insurance and finance at California State University Northridge. “But if you suppress rates you’re going to get availability problems.”

It’s similar to the dilemma companies face in insuring homes in wildfire-prone areas or along the Florida coast he said.

“There is an obvious and avoidable market crisis looming” three associations representing insurers writing more than 90% of California auto insurance premiums warned Lara in April.

“Auto insurers cannot operate indefinitely in California without the ability to collect adequate rates” the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies the Personal Insurance Federation of California and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA) said in their joint letter. “Criticism of decisions made during the pandemic including allegations by some that insurers should have provided more relief for customers do not justify ignoring the financial realities of the present.”

Since pandemic restrictions eased traffic is back nearly to what it was in 2019 before the coronavirus struck while drivers have become less safe so crashes injuries and fatalities increased said Bob Passmore an APCIA vice president and auto claims expert. Deaths fell slightly last spring for the first time in two years but any drop in those payments is offset by supply chain shortages and rapidly rising inflation.

Insurers should pay back their pandemic windfall but Lara hasn’t proposed the regulations needed to make them do so said Consumer Watchdog founder Harvey Rosenfield.

“In fact it’s not clear to us exactly what the commissioner is doing other than … he’s not approving rate increases” Rosenfield said. “So while I don’t think any company should get a rate increase until they’ve paid back what they illegally took from California motorists it’s got to be done through a formal process.”

Thirty-eight rate increase filings are now backed up along with five new requests filed this month.

Since then Geico in August closed its three-dozen brick-and-mortar storefronts in California and stopped allowing drivers to buy insurance by phone although it’s still allowing online sales.

Progressive President and Chief Executive Officer Tricia Griffith said in an earnings call last month that the company was slowing its growth in California because of the moratorium while Allstate has stopped using independent agents and tried to limit customers’ payment options until it was blocked from doing so by Lara’s office.

“To have them doing things here in California that indicates a pulling back as much as they feasibly can that’s an indication of an unhealthy marketplace and we think that’s directly tied to the fact that the insurance commissioner has not reviewed a rate filing in 2 1/2 years” said Denni Ritter APCIA’s vice president for state government relations.

Massachusetts and New York also stopped considering rate increase requests during the pandemic but have now started again the insurers said.

Insurers “are becoming increasingly less willing to write new business” in California because of the moratorium Joseph Lacher Jr. Kemper’s president chief executive officer and chairman said during an earnings call last month.

“In the relative short order my personal belief is we’ll start to see the markets seize up” he said. “And I just hope the commissioner doesn’t push it to that point because it will take a long time to restart it.”

Rosenfield doesn’t think the industry is in trouble but he fears that Lara’s inaction may give insurers grounds to challenge him in court.

“If there’s one tactic the insurance industry has perfected it’s trying to blackmail the public by threatening to pull out” he said.

Rosenfield thinks the companies are using the opportunity to cherry-pick their best customers to boost profits by making it tougher for higher-risk consumers to buy insurance. But he criticized Lara for “sort of precipitating a crisis” by not using his regulatory authority to block what he believes to be insurers’ discriminatory behavior.

Insurers collectively refunded $2.4 billion to California drivers during the pandemic though Lara calculated that the rebates fell far short of what consumers were owed. The state has 137 licensed insurance companies that collected more than $17 billion in private passenger auto insurance premiums in 2020 Soller said.

“Californians have many choices today for auto insurance in this highly competitive market and we will make sure it remains that way” Soller said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1cGl0ZXJtYWcuY29tL3RoZS1sZWFkZXItb2YtaW5zdXJhbmNlLXNlcnZpY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Leader of Insurance Services,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.jupitermag.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /the-leader-of-insurance-services/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001AFD9F523B0>, 'Connection to www.jupitermag.com timed out.

Hurricanes and tropical storms bring heavy rainfall and high storm surge which can cause devastating flooding even after making landfall. And it's not just hurricanes rainstorms throughout the year can cause flooding to occur just about anywhere.

Some people on social media claimed that homeowners insurance policies don’t typically cover flood damage. Google search data show people are also asking whether renters insurance policies cover flood damage and how to get flood insurance.

THE QUESTION

Do homeowners and renters insurance policies typically cover flood damage from hurricanes?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

No homeowners and renters insurance policies don’t typically cover flood damage from hurricanes.

WHAT WE FOUND

Homeowners insurance provides people with financial protection in the event of a disaster or accident involving their home. Standard policies insure the home itself and personal belongings. Renters insurance policies cover the cost of replacing personal belongings as well as accidents and injuries.

But homeowners and renters insurance policies don’t typically cover certain disaster-related damage.

The Insurance Information Institute (III) and insurance company Allstate say standard homeowners and renters insurance policies usually do not cover flood damage. This includes flooding brought on by or as a result of a hurricane Allstate says.

Instead people can purchase separate flood insurance policies from a private company or the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

These policies can cover buildings such as your home the contents within or both. Most offer coverage of up to $250000 for residential buildings and $100000 for personal belongings Amica Insurance says.

Flood insurance through the NFIP is available to anyone living in one of the 23000 participating communities throughout the United States.

To purchase flood insurance people can call their insurance company or agent. You can also use an online tool offered by the federal government to help find a flood insurance provider or call the NFIP at 877-336-2627.

Amica says there can be a 30-day waiting period before a flood insurance policy goes into effect. There are some exceptions including for people purchasing a home but it’s best not to wait to buy coverage until experts predict severe weather in your area.

For those who didn’t buy coverage ahead of a storm FEMA also offers assistance to people who live in areas that receive a presidential disaster declaration.

But Florida’s emergency management division warns the average FEMA payout to people who live in the state following a disaster declaration is about $5100 which may not be enough money to cover repairs. This compares to an average payout of about $29000 for people who file flood damage claims through the NFIP.

People without flood insurance may still find that their homeowners insurance policy offers some protection during a hurricane.

Some policies offer wind coverage for example and could offer protection if a hurricane’s winds damage your roof and rain gets in as a result AllState says. However some policies partially or completely exclude wind-related damage so it’s important to read your homeowners insurance policy or call your agent to check what coverage you have.

Standard homeowners and renters insurance policies don’t typically cover earthquake damage either. They will however generally cover losses from fire after an earthquake and any expenses you incur while living elsewhere during repairs."

Decrypt’s Art Fashion and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Google has set its sights on becoming the backbone of Web3.

While it might come as a surprise to Web3 natives Richard Widmann—Google’s head of strategy Web3 and cloud—sees the Web2 giant as ideologically aligned with many of crypto’s core values including open-source development and decentralization.

Prior to jumping headfirst into Google’s crypto initiatives Widmann worked as legal counsel for the trillion-dollar tech company and also has a background in securities law.

At the Mainnet conference in New York City he told Decrypt in an interview that he’s working to “build a giant bridge” between Web3 companies and blockchain by offering node services via Google Cloud. Nodes which run code for crypto networks can be imagined as foundational building blocks for Web3.

“The Cloud provision—we’re a layer zero” Widmann said.

The lawyer-turned strategist stressed that Google’s nodes have to be decentralized and global enough to be resilient to things like internet outages and political unrest because each node is a single point of failure.

And if one or two big tech companies like Amazon or Google end up controlling the overwhelming majority of blockchain nodes that defeats the purpose of decentralized technology.

“If everything is running on Google I will be the first to say that is a problem frankly” Widmann said of Web3’s future.

AD

AD

But decentralization isn’t a black or white issue. While Widmann sees decentralization as essential to Google’s Web3 strategy not everything can or should be as decentralized as possible.

“If you tried to build a data center with a group of DAO participants—I’m sure you could raise the capital but I don’t really know if you could coordinate around that kind of resourcing to build that” he said.

If decentralization is feasible should everything eventually be on the blockchain? Widmann doesn’t think so.

“There are some things where a censorship resistant distributed source of truth makes sense” Widmann said but added that “there are [also] a lot of things that don’t require immutable ledgers.”

Google Cloud is chain-agnostic and wants to let layer one protocols build on top of Cloud and compete against one another or fulfill different niches he said.

Widmann differentiated Google’s vision from that of Avalanche Network which he said is a layer one blockchain and not a layer zero for crypto like some might think. He acknowledged however that the label is a “rhetorical issue.”

“Any layer one protocol is running compute containers generally on a cloud of some kind” Widmann said. “Avalanche doesn’t have a cloud business. They run on data centers just like every other layer one.”

“They try and set themselves as that foundational layer but ultimately it’s all running on top of a compute container hosted somewhere and that’s where the cloud providers come in.”

Of the five biggest US companies by market value Tesla’s shares are by far the most expensive yet they’re the only ones whose performance comes close to Apple’s which has been a rare bright spot for investors in the sector this year. Tesla is down 22% this year while Apple has fallen 15%. By contrast Microsoft Corp. Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all declined 29% or more roughly the same as the Nasdaq 100 Index.

On the surface Tesla appears to be the polar opposite of Apple. The electric-vehicle maker is big on revenue growth but shorter on profits and several years ago it was burning so much cash it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Apple’s expansion by contrast has slowed to a crawl yet it has become a profit juggernaut with an expected $100 billion in net income this fiscal year.

“The correlation between the two is surprising but when you consider that Tesla is the only game in town for electric vehicles that makes it unique"" said Eric Clark portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors. “Other big tech names are in software or cloud which are more competitive markets and I think people underestimate the appeal of a pure play in a particular thematic.""

Apple and Tesla are similar in that they have huge market values -- $2.4 trillion and $862 billion respectively -- which means they benefit from flows into funds that track major indexes. They’re also less tied to the business cycle than other tech-related stocks according to Wiley Angell chief market strategist at Ziegler Capital Management.

“It means there’s a little less recession fear and a little less fear about what the Fed is doing"" said Angell whose firm holds shares of both Apple and Tesla. “The electric-vehicle story is still in the early innings and Apple gets a huge amount of its revenue from subscriptions or a recurring base which means it’s more stable.""

Those attributes -- and the cult followings that their products enjoy -- have made both stocks among the most popular for retail traders. Apple and Tesla were by far the most purchased stocks by mom-and-pop investors over the past five days Vanda Research said on Sept. 21.

Apple’s immense cash flows and commitment to return money to shareholders via dividends and buybacks have made it a favorite for investors seeking to play defense amid concerns that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation will push the US economy into recession. Meanwhile some of the volatility in Tesla this year is related to CEO Elon Musk’s decision to buy Twitter Inc. a deal he is trying to get out of.

Apple has been rewarded with a premium valuation relative to the Nasdaq 100 that sits well above the iPhone maker’s average over the past decade according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet at 23 times profit projected over the next 12 months it’s still less than half the price of Tesla.

In a market where investors are avoiding risk being relatively insulated from economic cycles thanks to a loyal customer base makes Apple and Tesla particularly attractive right now according to Ziegler Capital’s Angell.

“The reason they’ve outperformed is the reason we want to continue to own them"" he said.

The pain for investors in Facebook owner Meta Platforms is getting worse with the social-media company erasing all of the gains made during the pandemic. Meta shares are down 58% this year heading for only their second annual decline in its time as a public company the other being a 26% drop in 2018. The company’s market value has shriveled by $558 billion since the beginning of the year. Shares of the social media giant were up 0.6% on Monday.

We all know Google is big but it can be completely gobsmacking to realize just how big Google really is.

I recently came upon a mesmerizing animated bar chart on the wonderful Visual Capitalist site. I enjoy Visual Capitalist because it's all charts all the time and I have a somewhat unhealthy love of charts. In any case Visual Capitalist's James Eagle put together an animated bar chart running from 1993 to January 2022 showing the top ten websites in terms of traffic.

Also: Hackers are increasingly targeting Google Chrome

He pulled traffic numbers for each of the sites using a variety of sources. He arranged the data in bar chart form with each site having its own horizontal bar. Something about that caught my attention and I found myself staring at it realizing that what I really wanted to see was a chart of the current traffic of the sites arranged in a stacked bar format.

The following chart is the result of that desire. I remixed Eagle's January 2022 data into two main bars one for Google and YouTube and one for all the rest. I combined Google and YouTube into one bar because both are Alphabet Inc. properties.

And well wow:

David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Google's traffic alone is more than the remaining eight non-Google properties in the top ten.

Some quick notes. Facebook is the third largest in terms of traffic but even if you combine Facebook with Instagram (also owned by Facebook) the both of them don't even come close to Google's overall traffic.

Let's also keep in mind that Google includes not just search results but Gmail Maps all the Google Docs tools and many other Google resources.

I'm sure you're familiar with Twitter Wikipedia and Yahoo (yes Yahoo still seems to be in the game). But you might not be familiar with the remaining three on the list. Both Baidu and Yandex are search companies with Baidu servicing mostly China and Yandex mostly Russia. Both like Yahoo and Google have a whole range of add-on services beyond basic search.

Xvideo which is the tenth most popular site on the Internet is a porn site. It's owned by the Czech company WGCZ Holding which also owns Bang Bros DDF Network Penthouse magazine Private Media Group and Erogames. So yeah.

Conspicuously absent from the top ten list is Amazon. According to Statista Amazon had 2.7 billion visits in January 2022 putting it substantially below those in the top ten. Also missing are Microsoft (including Bing) and Apple.

I'd like to end this with some pithy and encouraging solution but I think the chart above squelches that. Google clearly owns the internet. If you ever wanted external validation for the Google SEO craziness that seems to have gripped the entire universe it's that one bar. We're all ants feeding on that one giant beast that is Google.

“There are some things where a censorship resistant distributed source of truth makes sense” Widmann said but added that “there are [also] a lot of things that don’t require immutable ledgers.”

Google Cloud is chain-agnostic and wants to let layer one protocols build on top of Cloud and compete against one another or fulfill different niches he said.

Widmann differentiated Google’s vision from that of Avalanche Network which he said is a layer one blockchain and not a layer zero for crypto like some might think. He acknowledged however that the label is a “rhetorical issue.”

“Any layer one protocol is running compute containers generally on a cloud of some kind” Widmann said. “Avalanche doesn’t have a cloud business. They run on data centers just like every other layer one.”

“They try and set themselves as that foundational layer but ultimately it’s all running on top of a compute container hosted somewhere and that’s where the cloud providers come in.”

Amazon said that beginning in October warehouse and transportation workers would earn between $16 and $26 an hour depending on their position and location in the U.S. The minimum wage at the Seattle-based e-commerce company which employed roughly 1.5 million workers as of the end of June will remain $15 an hour.

The pay raise follows an announcement from Amazon that it will hold a Prime-Day like holiday shopping event in October the first time it is having a major sales drive twice in a year following its Prime Day deals event in July. Target and Walmart also said last week they will offer holiday deals or gift returns in October to accommodate cash-strapped consumers expected to shop earlier and spread out their spending for the holiday season.

The company is also offering the pay bump amid a growing unionization movement inside its warehouses driven by worker complaints over pay and working conditions. Next month Amazon warehouse workers in upstate New York will vote in a union election following an organizing drive spearheaded by the Amazon Labor Union the grassroots group of former and current Amazon workers who pulled off a union win at a Staten Island warehouse in April. The nascent union then lost a subsequent election at a nearby warehouse.

Amazon had raised its average hourly pay to $18 an hour last year. It said the new raise would cost it $1 billion in the next year.

Separately the company said its pay access program Anytime Pay will also change to allow employees to get paid more than once or twice a month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIwMjIvOS8yNy8yMzM3MzU4OC9hbWF6b24td2FyZWhvdXNlLXJvYm90cy1tYW5pcHVsYXRpb24tcGlja2VyLXN0b3dlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon's robots are getting closer to replacing human hands,"In 2019 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos predicted that within a decade robotic systems will be advanced enough to grasp items with the dexterity of a human hand. Three years later Amazon looks to be making progress toward that goal.

A recent video published on the company’s science blog features a new “pinch-grasping” robot system that could one day do a lot of the work that humans in Amazon warehouses do today. Or potentially help workers do their jobs more easily.

The topic of warehouse automation is more relevant than ever in the retail and e-commerce industries especially for Amazon which is the largest online retailer and the second-largest private sector employer in the US. Recode reported in June that research conducted inside Amazon predicted that the company could run out of workers to hire in the US by 2024 if it did not execute a series of sweeping changes including increasing automation in its warehouses.

At the same time the company is facing the prospect of US workers starting to unionize after the victory by the Amazon Labor Union in the historic Staten Island vote and another upcoming union election in October in Upstate New York. Labor activists have long speculated that Amazon might ramp up automation efforts in response to unionization activity.

In a statement provided by an Amazon spokesman the company’s director of Robotics AI Siddhartha Srinivasa said: “[W]e have an incredible opportunity to help advance the science of robotic manipulation in ways that meaningfully benefit our employees and our customers. Our investments in robotics and technology are helping make jobs in our facilities better easier and safer as well as creating new career opportunities for our people.”

The robotic arm in question does not look as futuristic as you might imagine. The proof-of-concept machine uses an off-the-shelf metal pincher rather than some novel grasping device. But it can pick up a new item and deposit it on a metal chute every three seconds. At the rate it’s going in the video Amazon says the robot could handle more than 1000 items an hour meaning it could pick and stow items at rates several times faster than a human worker could. From a box of crayons to a container of what looks like garlic powder to a whisk broom each item is grasped and moved with no human direction. The robot utilizes multiple cameras to help it “see” the assortment of items in front of it as well as machine learning to help it decide the best way to pick up a given item and motion-planning algorithms to help the robot navigate the crowded scene without bumping or damaging any of the goods. Preliminary tests also found that the robot damages certain products at a much lower rate than other manipulation robots Amazon has tested.

The video and the robotic system in it were created late last year in a controlled lab test by Amazon technologists. This robot prototype can only move items weighing less than two pounds. In testing the robot was asked to handle hundreds of different items in this weight group and successfully grasped and moved around 95 percent of them according to Amazon spokesman Xavier Van Chau. On a larger scale the two-pound weight restriction would still allow the robot to grasp a selection of items making up about half of Amazon’s total product assortment. But the company is working on grasping solutions that would be able to handle any and every type of item that could fit inside an Amazon box perhaps by combining a pincher attachment with a popular suction method and having the system trained to know which “hand” should be used for which item.

How long it will take for Amazon to create a single robot that can handle the vast majority of products is up for debate but it’s a question of “when” not “if.” And when the “when” becomes “now” we’ll have an answer to one of the great unknowns of this era of automation: Will a new generation of warehouse robots that can grasp goods almost as well as human hands make work better or easier for the people doing these jobs? Or will the technological evolution eliminate the need for these workers and their jobs?

An Amazon spokesperson said the company is betting on the latter based on the way it has utilized other types of robots in its warehouses up to now. In June Amazon announced a prototype of a robotic system called Cardinal that lifts and sorts already-packaged orders and the company claims “reduces the risk of employee injuries by handling tasks that require lifting and turning of large or heavy packages or complicated packing in a confined space.” The company says it expects to introduce the system into an unspecified number of fulfillment centers in 2023. And last year the company unveiled another robot arm that it calls Robin which handles a similar task with lighter packages. Van Chau the company spokesperson declined to provide details on the deployment of either the Cardinal or Robin robots.

Amazon’s history in robotics dates back to when it bought a company called Kiva for $775 million. In the decade since it has rolled out more than 500000 roaming warehouse robots. During the same period the company says it has hired more than a million workers and points to this fact to try to dispel the notion that warehouse advancements are leading to worker elimination.

“From the early days of the Kiva acquisition our vision was never tied to a binary decision of people or technology” the company said in a recent blog post. “Instead it was about people and technology working safely and harmoniously together to deliver for our customers. That vision remains today.”

The Kiva robots did make some Amazon warehouse jobs easier. For those workers in picker or stower roles robots now transport shelves to them at a stationary workstation where they stand for 10 hours a day with padding beneath their feet. In Amazon’s pre-Kiva days these workers would walk 10 to 20 miles a day plucking merchandise from or adding goods to aisle after aisle of inventory shelves.

Kiva robots also brought downsides. Before the robots arrived a picker might have had a goal to handle 100 items an hour; Amazon tripled those expectations when the robots not the workers did the traveling. And with the addition of robots injury rates increased as workers were forced to move faster to keep up with higher quotas.

The tasks being completed by Amazon test robots like the “pinch-grasping” one in the new video potentially have more direct overlap with existing worker tasks. The robot like an Amazon picker or stower is retrieving a piece of merchandise from one location and moving it to another as quickly as possible without damaging it. That said while the robot prototype is picking items at a rate of more than 1000 an hour — around triple the typical rate of human pickers in Amazon warehouses — it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Amazon pickers in warehouses with robots have to pull each item out of a cluttered shelving unit and sometimes have to use a step stool to reach merchandise at the top. Similarly Amazon stowers have to fit each piece of merchandise into an open space on the mobile shelving unit versus the robot that is simply moving it from one open space to another. Van Chau the Amazon spokesperson said the prototype in the video was neither tested nor designed to pick items from shelves as workers do in the company’s current robotic warehouses.

Still robotics experts are paying attention. Martin Ford the author of multiple books about robotics including Rule of the Robots said while it’s unclear how Amazon’s most recent robot prototype would perform in a high-volume warehouse it still seems to show “remarkable progress.” With advancements like Amazon’s as well as those of many well-funded startups building robotic systems to try to solve for challenge of grasping with the dexterity of humans “it’s inevitable that the problem will be solved — perhaps sooner than many of us expect” Ford told Recode.

“And once that happens” Ford added “there’s little doubt that Amazon warehouses as well as many other environments are going to become a lot less labor intensive.”

Amazon maintains that robots and people will continue to work together inside its warehouses. But robotics experts say that one day the company may have a real option to depend on robots to do a lot of the work it currently depends on human employees to do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzcy5ibXdncm91cC5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2FydGljbGUvZGV0YWlsL1QwNDA0MDg4RU4vbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWJtdy12b2ljZS1hc3Npc3RhbnQtdG8tYmUtYmFzZWQtb24tYW1hem9uLWFsZXhhLXRlY2hub2xvZ3k_bGFuZ3VhZ2U9ZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next generation BMW voice assistant to be based on Amazon Alexa technology.,"Munich. The next-generation BMW voice assistant will be built on Alexa technology. This was announced today by Stephan Durach Senior Vice-President Connected Company and Development Technical Operations BMW Group and Dave Limp Senior Vice President of Devices and Services Amazon at Amazon’s annual Devices and Services launch event.



“The Alexa technology will enable an even more natural dialogue between driver and vehicle so drivers can stay focused on the road. This will bring the digital experience to an entirely new level” said Stephan Durach.



Dave Limp Amazon added: “This cooperation with BMW is a great example of what Alexa Custom Assistant was designed for — to make it faster and easier for companies to develop custom intelligent assistants for virtually any device without the cost and complexity of building from the ground up.”



Since the introduction of the first BMW voice assistant (BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant) in 2018 voice interaction has become an increasingly important part of BMW iDrive. The new BMW voice assistant will work in cooperation with Alexa providing customers the benefits of an intelligent assistant that is the vehicle and services expert while Alexa provides the familiar experience many customers are already using today—such as the ability to control music remotely manage their smart home add items to a shopping list or check the weather for the day. Customers can still choose to use either the BMW voice assistant and Alexa individually or have both assistants work alongside each other.



The first vehicles with the new generation of BMW’s voice assistant will launch within the next two years.



Data protection is a top priority for the BMW Group.
