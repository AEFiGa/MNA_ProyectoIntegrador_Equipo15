An upgrade or downgrade can quickly move a stock’s price and lift or lower an analyst’s target price. The target price can also guide investors as to the potential long-term appreciation or depreciation of a stock.

But the best analysts are only right about 50% of the time. And what does an investor do when the same analyst is the most optimistic or pessimistic among fellow analysts about several stocks in a particular sector?

Take a look at what one analyst says are the three residential real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks with the highest upside and how some of his peers view the same stocks.

Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) is a Houston-based residential REIT that owns and manages over 240000 square feet of apartment complexes in major cities across the U.S. Some of its apartment complexes also contain ground-floor retail space offices or mixed-use space.

Camden Property Trust pays a dividend of $3.76 which has grown 25% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations. It presently yields about 3.1%.

Barclay’s analyst Anthony Powell recently maintained an overweight position on Camden Property Trust while lowering the target price from $174 to $169. From its recent price that represents a potential upside of 43% the highest among residential REITs.

Evercore ISI Group analyst Steve Sakwa was not quite as optimistic lowering his price target twice within two weeks from $158 to $147. But that’s still a 25% upside from Camden Property Trust’s recent price.

Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is another residential REIT that owns and manages over 101000 units in nearly 300 communities across 16 states.

The Germantown Tennessee-based REIT pays an annual dividend of $5 per share currently yielding about 3.3%. The dividend has grown by 43% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations.

Barclay’s Powell also recently maintained an overweight position on Mid-America Apartment Communities and raised its price target from $211 to $215. This presents a potential upside of 41% from its recent price.

However analyst Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho Bank was far less sanguine maintaining a neutral position and nudging the price target down from $178 to $177.

Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) is a Chicago-based REIT that boasts over 300 apartment buildings located in large urban areas such as Boston New York Washington D.C Seattle San Francisco and Denver.

Story continues

Equity Residential pays an annual dividend of $2.50 which currently yields about 3.8%. The dividend has grown 24% over the past five years with no cuts nor eliminations over that time.

Barclay’s Powell also maintained an equal-rate position on Equity Residential while raising the price target from $83 to $88. That increase now presents Equity Residential with a potential upside of 35%.

But Powell’s target price was much higher than several other analysts who wrote about Equity Residential. Sakwa of Evercore ISI Group sees $81 as a more realistic target price and John Kim of BMO Capital Markets even downgraded Equity Residential from outperform to market perform while slicing his target price from $88 to $74. That only equates to 13% of upside potential from its recent price.

So where does that leave investors? The most prudent advice is to consider analyst opinions as a guide to potential appreciation but still assess stocks by their fundamentals and/or technical indicators before making any purchases.

Moderna Vaccine Can Leave a Rash,"As with most vaccines the COVID-19 injection comes with a few less-than-desirable side effects per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) like pain or swelling at the injection site fatigue chills body aches or headaches.

Another reported side effect specifically for Moderna's and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines is a large red lesion around the injection site according to an April 2021 study published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

The side effect has been dubbed ""COVID arm"" according to the CDC but it also has a more medically-accurate label: delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity which essentially means a delayed reaction on the skin.

Here's more about the side effect—and why it shouldn't prevent you from getting your COVID-19 shot.

Why Does COVID Arm Happen—And What Makes It an Unusual Side Effect?

COVID arm appears to be the body's immune system response to the vaccine.

""It seems to be an allergic reaction—a skin reaction that occurs after getting an injection"" board-certified dermatologist Debra Jaliman MD who has a private practice in Manhattan NYC told Health. ""We see firmness and redness at the site where the injection occurred."" Some people who've experienced COVID arm also report itching and say the lesion is painful to touch.

Mass General Hospital

The interesting thing about COVID arm is that it doesn't appear right away. ""Typically it shows up five to nine days after the first shot"" Dr. Jaliman said. That makes it different from most vaccine side effects which usually occur within a day or two.

COVID arm reportedly lasted up to 21 days for some individuals who were administered the Moderna vaccine per a JAMA Dermatology article published in May 2021.

Still COVID arm is generally a brief harmless response. According to Dr. Jaliman ""[the rash] should go away within 24 hours to a week"" three to four days is the most common time it takes to subside.

What Else To Know About COVID Arm

The COVID-19 arm reaction has reportedly shown up more in women. For example 95.4% of women who had had COVID-19 vaccinations reportedly had COVID arm according to a British Journal of Dermatology study published in September 2021. Still the association there is unclear as well.

Furthermore the delayed reaction shouldn't prevent people from getting additional shots Dr. Jaliman said recommending that people get subsequent shots in the other arm.

To help ease the itching Dr. Jaliman suggested an antihistamine like Benadryl or a topical steroid adding that ice would help reduce the swelling too. Because it's not an infection treatment would not include antibiotics.

But if the symptoms last any more than a week or you experience swelling or pain anywhere else in your body make an appointment with your healthcare provider just to be on the safe side.

In the event that you do go see your healthcare provider for potential COVID arm make sure you tell them that you recently had your shot to help with the accuracy of your diagnosis. A June 2021 Journal of Primary Care & Community Health study found that some cases of COVID arm had been misdiagnosed as cellulitis a serious bacterial infection that requires medical attention.

If you experience any side effects after your vaccine you're also encouraged to report them to either of the CDC's vaccine safety and tracking systems: the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) or V-safe.

A Quick Review

There are some side effects of COVID-19 vaccinations including COVID arm or delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity. It's considered one of the body's immune responses but can show up days after the vaccination is given. Still COVID arm is typically short-lived and harmless and treatment might entail using an antihistamine topical steroid or ice. Ultimately it's not a side effect that should keep you from getting a COVID-19 vaccine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmFtb3VudHByZXNzZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vY2JzLW1lZGlhLXZlbnR1cmVzL3Nob3dzL2plb3BhcmR5L3JlbGVhc2VzLz92aWV3PTEwMTE1Ny1v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIRST-EVER 'JEOPARDY!'

BioNTech also plans to create a clinical scale end-to-end mRNA manufacturing facility based on its ‘BioNTainer’ solution – a modular manufacturing concept for mRNA manufacturing and formulation - in Melbourne with the aim of supporting the design manufacture and clinical testing of product candidates.

And BioNTech will also establish its AI-driven early warning and identification tech at the site which will be used to detect future disease threats and develop new treatments and vaccines in response.

‘Major coup for Victoria’​

Victoria is already the leader in Australian pharmaceutical and biological manufacturing responsible for nearly 60% of Australia’s pharmaceutical exports (making it the highest value advanced manufactured export).

The state now wants to lead the way in mRNA manufacturing in the country having already attracted Moderna to build an mRNA manufacturing facility in Melbourne​​ (set to be operational in 2024 with capacity of up to 100 million vaccine doses annually).

Given the strength of BioNTech’s global network the German biotech's new facility is also expected to attract interest from researchers locally regionally and globally. Victoria Treasurer Tim Pallas describes the partnership with BioNTech as a ‘major coup for Victoria’ with the plans providing ‘incredible collaboration opportunities for our researchers and international biotech companies’.

BioNTech CEO and co-founder Prof. Ugur Sahin M.D. adds that the facility will focus on collaborations in the Asia-Pacific region.

“Science and innovation can only make a difference if it is applied outside of the laboratories and reaches people worldwide""​ he said.

“Australia provides excellent academic research and we are looking forward to collaborating with world-class scientists and researchers to strengthen Australia’s mRNA ecosystem and to jointly develop potential novel treatments and vaccines for people worldwide.”​

R&D center and manufacturing capabilities

The State of Victoria and BioNTech will establish a research and innovation center directed in partnership with the State with the aim to support Australia’s mRNA ecosystem by curating projects and to determine their potential transition into preclinical and clinical development supported by BioNTech’s advice and know-how.

The partnership will also include the research and development of experimental therapies including mRNA-based product candidates for indications with high unmet medical need for instance in oncology. BioNTech will support the R&D efforts on a project-by-project basis with the company’s expertise in mRNA research and clinical development of potential new products.

BioNTech will also create end-to-end clinical-scale manufacturing facility for mRNA-based medicines and product candidates in Melbourne with its BioNTainer a mobile modular manufacturing unit requiring limited space for operation. This will allow for timely and flexible local production of different mRNA-based constructs and products across a variety of indications and is expected to create hundreds of jobs during construction and operation in Melbourne.

CAR-T cell therapies

BioNTech also pledges to further strengthen the clinical development capabilities in Australia: particularly with regards to its oncology pipeline (which currently has a total of 18 candidates in 23 ongoing clinical trials).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy9tZXJjay1tYWtlcy1lbnp5bWUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtZGVhbC1yYXBpZGx5LWdyb3dpbmctZ2lua2dvLWJpb3dvcmtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck hooks up with Ginkgo Bioworks in manufacturing deal,"Less than a week after acquiring biotechs on either side of the Atlantic Ginkgo Bioworks has scored a deal with Merck to bolster the pharma giant's active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing.

Specializing in synthetic biology Ginkgo will engineer biocatalytic enzymes for Merck’s use in its drug manufacturing processes the companies said.

Ginkgo which has also partnered with Roche Biogen and Moderna to improve their manufacturing formulas will develop up to four enzymes for Merck in a deal that could be worth up to $144 million if specified milestones are met.

As explained by Ginkgo biocatalysis is an alternative to some chemical synthesis and purification steps allowing for cost savings in manufacturing.

Merck is a pioneer in biocatalysis using it to improve its manufacturing process for drugs such as Januvia Gingko’s co-founder and CEO Jason Kelly said in a release.

Just last week Ginkgo acquired two companies—announcing the deals on the same day. Five-year-old Altar of France specializes in fluidic technology to produce microbes used in the production of a variety of products. Eight-year-old Circularis of Oakland Calif. brings a circular RNA promoter screening platform.

Ginkgo launched in 2009 to develop a platform that eases the cell engineering process. Initially it applied the platform to pesticides and perfumes but increasingly turned to pharmaceutical manufacturing.

In early 2020 Ginkgo teamed with Moderna to help process optimization for raw materials used in mRNA vaccines. A Ginkgo deal last year with Biogen was designed to develop recombinant AAV vectors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL2NvdmlkLTE5LWJpdmFsZW50LXZhY2NpbmUtYm9vc3Rlci1tb2Rlcm5hLTMwMDE0NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine available in Singapore Oct 14 three days ahead of schedule,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) will bring forward the administration of the Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine to Oct 14 three days ahead of the previously announced date the ministry said on Tuesday (Oct 11).

The early rollout was made possible by the ministry's operations teams completing preparations ahead of the deadline.

In addition there are ""benefits to administering early as infections are rising due to the XBB Omicron subvariant"" said MOH.

The XBB strain also known as BA.2.10 has been detected in several countries such as Australia Bangladesh Denmark India Japan and the USA since August. Based on preliminary local data MOH said XBB cases are not more serious than other Omicron subvariants.

“The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine is based on the same original vaccine with the same dosage for boosting” added MOH.

“Instead of targeting only the original COVID-19 virus the updated version also targets the Omicron variant. It therefore will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants. It is proven to be safe and effective.”

The ministry added that the approach and process of updating a vaccine with new strains of a disease is an “established practice”. It added that based on post market surveillance to date more than 11 million updated bivalent mRNA vaccine doses have been administered in the US without any safety concerns reported.

Speaking to reporters at the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre at Commonwealth on Tuesday Health Minister Ong Ye Kung acknowledged that COVID-19 cases in Singapore have been rising but said that was not the main factor in the decision to bring forward administration of the bivalent vaccine.

Mr Ong and Minister for Trade Gan Kim Yong - co-chairs of the Government's multi-ministry task force on COVID-19 - received a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine at the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre.

“Most important is that operationally we are ready"" Mr Ong said. ""Yesterday's report was almost 5000 cases and usually Tuesday is double that of Monday’s cases so today I think we should expect 10000 cases or more. So cases are rising … If we are operationally ready and we can do it earlier I would say why not?”

Mr Ong also spoke about the XBB strain adding that MOH is watching it ""very closely"".

""XBB is demonstrating characteristics that it is dominating over all other sub-variants. It has been detected in many parts of the world but in Singapore is rising very fast - within three weeks from nothing it is now over half of all the daily cases"" he added.

""But so far what is good is that there's no evidence that it leads to more severe outcomes."""

The Miami-based Medicaid-focused virtual behavioral health company has raised a total of $60 million. It will use the new funding to expand into new markets and into more value-based care arrangements with payers.

The company will also put the funding toward building its data and technology infrastructure. This infrastructure will better enable its patient engagement and outcomes tracking systems. Care tracking and engagement are key to Brave Health closing and launching value-based care deals in the 18 states where it operates a news release states.

This was Town Hall Ventures’ first investment from its third fund. The venture capital firm founded by former Biden and Obama health care leader Andy Slavitt joined existing investors Union Square Ventures and City Light Capital in the round.

Brave Health creates partnerships with local health care providers and health plans that focus on getting Medicaid patients referred to mental health services into care as quickly as possible.

While partnerships with local providers are vital to getting patients Brave Health strikes up financial relationships with payers that operate Medicaid managed care organizations company CEO and co-founder Anna Lindow told Behavioral Health Business.

The company presently has three value-based care contracts with payers in place; Brave Health struck its first value-based contract with Molina Healthcare of Texas.

Speed to care and activation of care is a common measurement of value through the three value-based care arrangements Lindow said.

Brave Health employs nearly 200 behavioral health providers — including therapists psychiatrists peer support specialists and nurse practitioners. The company engages with providers as employees rather than contractors a common practice among digital behavioral health companies.

“Nearly 1-in-4 people get their insurance through Medicaid in the United States. Yet the number of providers who accept Medicaid has actually decreased in certain places” Lindow said. “It’s an area where we feel like there’s an enormous amount of opportunity for innovation for progress and for partnership with health plans.”

About 50% of all U.S. counties do not have a psychiatrist or addiction medicine specialist while about 23% of all behavioral health prescribers (including psychiatrists) don’t see any Medicaid beneficiaries according to research from George Washington University.

Town Hall Ventures made the investment because Brave Health seeks to systematically improve behavioral health delivery in addition to the health of medically vulnerable and underserved populations Town Hall Ventures Partner Anna Fagin told BHB.

“In the last month Brave Health has helped more than 4000 people on Medicaid — [at] the most vulnerable point in their life — find a behavioral health resource when almost no one is there to help them” Fagin said adding she and Town Hall Ventures expect the company to continue to quickly grow.

Year to date Brave Health has received 23000 referrals which represents an exponential growth in its patient count since beginning to work with health plans in 2019 the release states. The company offers outpatient services and covers over 65 million lives through over 200 health plan partnerships.

On top of the growth trajectory Town Hall Ventures seeks to place investment in health care companies that “can take accountability for the results that they’re delivering and get compensated for it.”

“You have to be able to be confident in your results before you’re ready to take accountability for them” Fagin said. “And that’s where this infrastructure and upfront investment comes into place. Behavioral health has been an area where we see massive opportunity to take that accountability and it’s what enables massive impact at scale.”

Town Hall Ventures also has placed investments in value-based care-oriented addiction treatment and mental health provider Eleanor Health which landed a $50 million round in April.

While Medicaid is notorious for patients that are more acute and bring with them health plan reimbursement that is lower than average Lindow said that value-based care arrangements allow for operators to find financial success while impacting health at scale.

“That is exactly what we’ve built and what we are going to continue to build” she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JyYXZlLWhlYWx0aC1zZWN1cmVzLTQwbS1pbi1zZXJpZXMtYy1mdW5kaW5nLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1hY2Nlc3MtdG8tbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1mb3ItbWVkaWNhaWQtcG9wdWxhdGlvbnMtMzAxNjQ1MzI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BRAVE HEALTH SECURES $40M IN SERIES C FUNDING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ...,"Town Hall Ventures Joins Union Square Ventures and City Light Capital as Company Expands Into Value-Based Care

MIAMI Oct. 11 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Brave Health the largest virtual mental health provider and engagement platform focused on serving Medicaid populations today announced a $40M Series C funding round led by Town Hall Ventures with existing investors Union Square Ventures City Light Capital and others joining as well. Brave Health is the first investment from Town Hall Venture's newly-announced $350M fund. The company has raised a total of $60M to date and this most recent funding will support their continued expansion into value-based care arrangements and into new and existing markets.

Since launching with health plans in Florida in 2019 Brave Health has rapidly grown. The organization now serves over 65M covered lives across more than 200 health plan contracts through their unique approach to patient engagement treatment and integration with plans and other providers. Earlier this year the company announced its first value-based contract with Molina Healthcare of Texas. Brave Health also recently signed a value-based contract with Sunshine Health bringing the total number of potential Medicaid members under Brave Health's care in a value-based arrangement to more than one million.

""The team at Brave Health has demonstrated a commitment to doing the hard work of engaging the most vulnerable populations at their most vulnerable moments and getting them into ongoing care. And they're taking on the accountability to improve patient outcomes and ultimately reduce the total cost of care"" said Andy Slavitt general partner Town Hall Ventures. ""We are thrilled to support Brave Health's expansion as they work to revamp the way mental health services are delivered and paid for on behalf of Medicaid populations across the country.""

Brave Health will use these funds to continue to build the technology and data infrastructure that powers their industry-leading patient engagement and outcomes engine as well as to further expand into new states and accelerate the closing and activation of new value-based contracts in the 18 states in which they operate.

""Innovation in Medicaid care delivery and reimbursement models is critical for our healthcare system"" said Anna Lindow co-founder and CEO of Brave Health. ""Today we're energized by the enthusiasm from our forward-looking investors and health plan partners around this aim.""

Today access to mental health services for the nation's most vulnerable populations is a public health crisis. The percentage of psychiatrists that accept Medicaid has fallen to 35 percent according to previous research reported by JAMA Psychiatry. With nearly one in four Americans now receiving healthcare benefits through Medicaid this gap leaves many without the ability to get ongoing critical care. Access though is not the only component needed to change health outcomes. Engagement is a crucial and often elusive first step.

Brave Health plays a critical role in driving engagement among Medicaid beneficiaries through a number of data-driven tech-enabled approaches and interventions that leverage the company's integrated model and generate a more than 80 percent contact success rate. In practice this approach allows Brave Health to drive results around closing care gaps and reducing wait times for first-time appointments to as soon as the same day which represents a radical improvement over the national average of 48 days. Once individuals are engaged Brave Health care teams composed of therapists psychiatric providers and peer support specialists work in close partnership with patients as well as other stakeholders like health plan case managers and other providers. By working within the system and sharing data and insights Brave Health is able to drive better short- and long-term outcomes and reduce costs associated with events like potentially-preventable hospitalizations driving as high as a 66 percent reduction in readmission-related costs.

Partnership with the broader system drives tangible results: year to date in 2022 over 23000 individuals have been referred to Brave Health for care representing exponential growth since beginning work with health plans in 2019.

Last week Boston Beer’s spirit-based Truly Vodka Seltzer began hitting shelves. The week ended with an announcement from Mark Anthony Brands that they’re releasing a White Claw branded spirit-based vodka and soda as well. Are we officially in the era of the RTD trade-ups?

The moves from major beverage players do not come unexpected. Hard seltzer sales have slowed while sales of spirits-based ready-to-drink cocktails (RTDs) continue to rise reflecting the overall spirits premiumization trend. Last year premixed cocktails were the fastest growing spirit category in 2021 according to a report by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). Supplier revenue of pre-mixed cocktails and spirits-based RTDs rose by 42.3% to $1.6 billion in sales in 2021. The category also experienced a 56% increase in volume selling 13.1 million more cases than in 2020 according to the same report.

Meanwhile momentum for hard seltzer has hit a stall after a rise during the pandemic. Hard seltzer makes up 60% of the RTD segment but volume is projected to decrease according to a new report from alcohol company the IWSR. Sales of hard seltzer already declined 5.5% in the last year according to data from market research firm NielsenIQ.

During a distributors’ convention Matt Escalante Molson Coors VP of marketing for hard seltzers stressed that Topo Chico Spirits “isn’t a replacement for our hard seltzer.” More so the project is a premium way to complement the existing portfolio and drive trade up. The new line Topo Chico Spirited will be made with tequila and vodka the two leading spirit bases for RTDs.

“Several malt-based brands have introduced spirit-based offerings given the trend toward this segment” said Brandy Rand chief strategy officer of IWSR adding that the company forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 26.2% from 2022 to 2026 for spirit-based RTDs led primarily by pre-mixed cocktails and spirit-based seltzers.

But the move into spirits doesn’t necessarily signal an abandonment of existing hard seltzer lines especially if products are performing well. Topo Chico’s Margarita variety pack was Drizly’s No. 1 selling new item in Q2; and the brand family is now “neck and neck” with Bud Light Seltzer for the No. 3 hard seltzer spot excluding spirit-based offerings namely High Noon Sun Sips.

By leveraging Topo Chico’s popularity into a spirits-based line Molson Coors is replicating how many larger alcoholic beverage companies are partnering or extending lines to build on brand equity. More than 50% of consumers are influenced to purchase RTDs made by a well-known spirits beer or soft-drink brand according to the IWSR report. RTDs produced by a local craft brewery or distillery also rated highly whereas celebrity-backed brands ranked lowest in terms of influence.

Large companies have certainly also brought unique RTD products into the fold since the category’s popularity took off: Constellation Brands purchased Austin Cocktails this year and last year Diageo acquired fast-growing hard spirits seltzer maker Far West Spirits which produces the Lone River Ranch Water and spirit-based RTD-maker Loyal 9 Cocktails. And Anheuser-Busch InBev has been a winner in the space since purchasing segment leader Cutwater Spirits in 2019. In the past few months however more announcements have come from companies who are building versus buying.

“We’d expect more mergers and acquisitions for unique RTD propositions while larger companies tend to focus on brand line extensions or co-branded partnerships to leverage known trademarks versus launching new brands” said Rand.

Examples include Coca-Cola’s roster of mashups: the Jack & Coke RTD global launch Simply Spiked Lemonade through its partnership with Molson Coors. Vita Coco also announced in July a collaboration with spirits conglomerate Diageo to release a line of coconut water spiked with Captain Morgan white rum.

Escalante also stressed that the brand has an opportunity to reach new drinkers and raise awareness with 21- to 34-year-olds with its next chapter. That’s in sync with new data from IWSR showing that millennials (age 25-39) make up 43% of RTD consumption which is about 4 in 10 drinkers. Gen Z (21-24) is also important as they enter into drinking in terms of brand trial and awareness especially given how much choice is available and the fact that people tend to drink across categories more frequently according to Rand.

“Gen Z also tends to favor premium and lower ABV products and demonstrates more tempo drinking which is staying in the occasion longer by enjoying the social experience” said Rand.

For Boston Beer leaning into its spirits products to drive growth is a strategy after its malt-based RTD offerings didn’t perform as expected this year. The company’s Dogfish Head’s canned cocktails are gaining traction in the canned cocktail market. Dollar sales of the Dogfish Head brand family are outpacing the overall segment according to NielsenIQ total U.S. all off-premise data year-to-date through September 17 shared by Bump Williams Consulting.

By pushing Dogfish Head and Truly Vodka Boston Beer is also diversifying its ABV offerings: Truly Vodka offers 5% ABV while Dogfish hovers a little higher around 7%.

CHICAGO Oct. 11 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mondelēz International Inc. (Nasdaq: MDLZ) marked the 130th anniversary of its Biscuit Flour Mill in Toledo Ohio with a ceremony and day-long celebration on Saturday October 8 which included local employees local and state elected officials and other honored guests from the Company and the local community.

With more than a century and a quarter of ongoing milling operations the Company’s Toledo Flour Mill is the largest dedicated soft-wheat mill in North America today with one of the largest grain storage capacities at 5.5 million bushels of wheat. The Mill first began operations in 1892 when Benjamin Harrison was President of the United States and became part of the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in 1926.



The Toledo Mill has made many significant contributions to the local economy and the grain milling industry in general such as when scientists working at the Mill developed flour analysis tools that went on to become industry standards. Today flour from the Toledo Mill is shipped to the Company’s bakeries across North America where it is used to make many of its best-loved snacks including Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies and Ritz crackers.



“Our Toledo Flour Mill has been a valuable part of our U.S. baking footprint for more than a century and I am proud to join this celebration with the many dedicated employees who have been part of our business for many years and have helped make this important milestone possible” said Claudio Parrotta SVP & Chief Supply Chain Officer North America at Mondelēz International. “I want to thank Plant Leader Dee Lewis and our dedicated team of employees in Toledo for all their hard work supporting our business and for putting together such a fitting tribute on this important milestone.”

Facts about Mondelēz International’s Toledo Flour Mill:

Largest soft-flour mill in the United States

Approximately 100 full-time employees

Began operations in 1892 and became part of National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in 1926

On average day processes nearly 1000 acres of wheat (equivalent to approximately 1000 football fields!)

On average day produces more than 1500 tons of flour (equivalent to weight of seven commercial airplanes!)

Storage capacity of 5.5 million bushels of wheat (enough to fill nearly 5500 semi-truck trailers!)

Zero production waste to landfill facility and wheat supplier for Triscuit crackers which recently piloted a field-to-shelf consumer transparency program

Story continues

In addition to celebrating the Mill’s milestone anniversary this event also recognized the employees who have helped make the Toledo Flour Mill so special over many decades.



Speaking before the audience of employees and guests including representatives from the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) union which represents hourly workers at the Mill Toledo Mill site leader Dee Lewis shared “Many of the people here today built their careers as valuable members of this Biscuit Flour Mill team and our site continues to provide an important ingredient to many of America’s favorite snacks from right here in Toledo. We are so proud to recognize all of our employees and especially those long-tenured teammates who are celebrating their own significant milestone work anniversaries as part of today’s event.”



Generations of Ohioans have contributed to the growth and success of the Mondelēz International Toledo Mill over the years and Ohio dignitaries at the federal state and local level joined in recognizing Mondelēz International on this historic milestone.



As part of the formal program Ohio Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur presented the Mill’s leadership with a Congressional Recognition which she submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives commending the facility on this occasion and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose shared a statewide proclamation recognizing the significance of the Mill’s 130th anniversary.



Other elected officials including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Ohio Governor Mike DeWine State Senator Teresa Fedor and Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukieweicz also recognized the anniversary by applauding Mondelēz International’s long-standing commitment to the City of Toledo and the State of Ohio.



“For more than a century flour milled right here in Northwest Ohio fed people across Ohio and around the world. Today’s celebration shows how successful a business can be with a strong presence and good jobs here in Ohio which benefits everyone” said Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown.

What is your current role and what makes it exciting?

I am currently working as Cadbury Biscuits Brand Manager in UK. Working on Cadbury is a dream of many marketeers I remember studying Cadbury's ""best in class"" campaigns many years ago in university and thinking about the people behind them that they must be special & talented. And now I'm one of them and it does feel special indeed. This year Cadbury has been voted as the most loved brand in UK ahead of Google Apple or Amazon and it’s an honor to work for such iconic brand and true taste of the nation. While Cadbury is an established leader in chocolate in biscuits it's still a relatively young growing brand and the opportunity is huge. That's another exciting thing about my role- I get to work on making Cadbury an icon in biscuits.

How has your career developed at MDLZ?

I joined MDLZ in 2017 in Moscow Russia; was responsible first for savoury biscuits - brand TUC then for Gum & Candy leading Dirol brand in Eastern Europe. In 2022 I was given an opportunity to move to London and join the Northern Europe business. In my current role I am responsible for Cadbury biscuits in UK.

What does it take to be successful as a brand manager or marketer in the industry?

I believe the key to be successful in marketing is to know and to love your consumer. Be curious know the latest trends your audience follows technologies they use news they see and opinion leaders they trust and be fearless to use all that to connect with your consumers on a new level. As an example from my experience we chose to focus on Gen Z audience for Dirol Gum few years ago targeting them across all the touchpoints - we launched NPDs via TikTok developed online game collaborated with local designers to create a branded merch even dropped a limited-edition sneakers made from recycled chewing gum! And within 3 years Dirol became brand #1 amongst GenZ.

What kind of project assignments have you done outside of the traditional career moves that helped you further your career?

I believe that if you want to have an outstanding career you have to do more than is expected from you. And as a naturally curious and restless person I often ended up taking additional projects outside of my main scope. I was involved in various cross-category projects organizing conferences and team events building capabilities for cross functional team and many more. I became a part of cross-category Football Project team right after I joined Mondelez it was dedicated to World Cup 2018 in Russia. That was a great way to get to know everyone in a new company and build a visibility for myself and eventually led to me getting offered my next role in Gum & Candy. And last year I was chosen as a leader of Football Project for Eastern Europe the position which was normally given to someone much more senior. So going ""extra mile"" definitely pays off in MDLZ.

How do you embed diversity in your marketing activities?

Diversity is one of important parts of our marketing activities we always want our campaigns to be inclusive and our products to reach a diverse audience. We include diversity now as part of the brief for any marketing campaign we want to make sure we have diverse team working on the project to create the product which would be relevant for different consumers. Recently we had a great project for Cadbury Fingers - ""Sign with Fingers"" led by my colleague Susanne Nowak. It's aimed to raise awareness about problems deaf people face and teach wider audience a bit of British sign language. The campaign was developed in partnership with NDCS (National Deaf Children Society) and involved deaf people working on the project in the production team and starring in TVC.

How do you describe the culture at MDLZ?

First thing I would mention talking about culture in MDLZ is people. Based on my experience across markets and businesses MDLZ people are best in class professionals and at the same time open friendly and supportive. Diversity is one of the company's strengths we have 5 different nationalities in my small team right now. And that helps to assess things from different perspectives learn from each other and get stronger professionally. Flexibility is another great thing about MDLZ I am proud of how company managed the work during the pandemic and after giving people full control of their time and working place. And people now go to the office because they want to connect and have fun together teams get together in different locations or just work from home and spend more time with family - whatever works for each person. And that is the perfect and most effective set up for me.

And finally what is your favorite MDLZ brand? What kind of (childhood) memories are attached to it?

This is an extremely hard question as we have so many iconic brands and I have memories with many of them. The one which first comes to mind is Wispa back in 90s it was quite popular in Russia and I used to get it from my dad as a reward for good grades etc. some good old child bribery :-). Wispa left RU market many years ago but I always used to bring it home when I came across it somewhere abroad. And now I live in UK with constant access to Wispa childhood dream came true!

If I talk about now - my favorite brand would be Philadelphia cheese I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for good part of Philadelphia Light sales in my local Tesco :) And I can come up with dozens of recipes with Philadelphia it literally goes well with everything!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0ZWNoLWFwYWMuY29tL2hlbWFudC1ydXBhbmktaXMtbW9uZGVsZXotaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbHMtbmV3LXByZXNpZGVudC1vZi1zZWEtYnVzaW5lc3MtdW5pdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hemant Rupani is Mondelez International's new president of SEA business unit - MARKETECH APAC,"Singapore – Global food company Mondelez International has announced the appointment of Hemant Rupani as its new president of its Southeast Asia business unit.

Appearance-wise this £380 ATX motherboard is styled very well in my opinion. The main colouring is largely dark black but there are sprinkles of colour via MSI’s logos and branding.

One really cool design decision is the inclusion of ports bandwidth and connectivity on the chipset heatsink. Functionally I’d argue that this piece of styling is very good; I like it!

Regarding heatsinks MSI has gone for the big-and-beefy approach. A large slab of metal covers the B650 chipset and this also acts as the hub for some of the M.2 metal strips to be screwed into.

You get an individual strip cooler for the uppermost M.2 SSD slot with thermal pads on both sides. I like this design because it is tool-less through-and-through. As is now common the SSD can be secured via a tool-less latch. But the heatsink can also be removed by pushing a mechanism to free and pop it out of place.

The VRM heatsinks are two large blocks of metal that will aim to cool via their sheer size and heatpipe connection. MSI doesn’t make the best effort to increase surface area via fins but these should be absolutely stellar though particularly with some airflow nearby. And a sizable rear IO cover sits atop the ports on blends into the VRM heatsink.

The B650 Carbon WiFi uses a 6-layer 2oz copper PCB and feeds a CPU with dual-8-pin connectors.

The primary power delivery system is built around a 16+2+1 stage power delivery solution with Monolithic Power Systems hardware. This uses an MPS2123 / MP2857 PWM controller and there are MPS 2206 / MP87670 DrMOS power stages that are 80A rated.

This is a proficient power delivery setup from a hardware perspective.

The primary PCIe x16 slot is steel-reinforced for graphics card usage. This runs at PCIe Gen 4 x16 bandwidth whereas the other full-length slot runs at Gen 4 x4 bandwidth.

We know single-GPU is the go-to these days. And that’s a good thing given that modern graphics cards with their ludicrous 4+ slot coolers will leave only the bottom PCIe 3.0 x1 slot accessible.

One clear missing feature is any form of quick or easy release latch or button for the PCIe graphics slot. This is genuinely a problem given the proximity of the PCIe slot tab to the large M.2 cooling plate. I’m disappointed by MSI’s lack of this feature on a £380 motherboard!

Regarding M.2 connections that top slot runs at PCIe Gen 5 x4 from the CPU lanes. There are two more CPU-fed M.2 slots running at PCIe Gen 4 x4 and the fourth M.2 is PCIe Gen 4 x4 from the B650 chipset.

Onboard connectivity is an area where B650 comes in light versus X670. But MSI still offers plenty of options.

You get six SATA ports which I think is sensible for this market segment though just the one 5Gbps USB header may cause a hiccup for some. The front panel USB-C header runs at 3.2 Gen 2 so is not uber speed – the 20Gbps port is on the rear IO.

Seven total fan headers is awesome particularly with MSI’s smart distribution. And three addressable plus a single standard RGB header is ample.

MSI also includes some debug LEDs near the 24-pin which are ideal for troubleshooting. There are no onboard buttons though which is fine for this board’s audience.

Audio runs from the Realtek ALC4080 codec.

The rear IO is hefty with USB support. There are 9 total Type-A ports 7 of which run at 10Gbps while the remaining pair runs as USB 2.0 for legacy connectivity. The single USB Type-C port is 20Gbps rated.

Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 is delivered by the AMD-branded WiFi chipset while 2.5Gb Ethernet is from a Realtek RTL8125 NIC.

MSI provides the full complement of audio outputs in addition to full-sized DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1.

Sizable BIOS Flash and Clear CMOS buttons on the rear IO are two features I love to see.

In this review we are taking our first look at AMD’s new B650 chipset via the MSI B650 Carbon WiFi motherboard. Coming in at £380 in the UK this certainly is not the value successor to B550 that many users may have expected.

With that said though there are a host of truly high-end features including a 16+2+1 VRM with 80A power stages quadruple M.2 slots and dual high-speed networking connections. So let’s take a closer look at this premium B650 offering.

It is important for us to highlight the differences between the new AM5 chipsets. X670 is the premium option and B650 is more mainstream.

Both X670 and B650 come in E- and non-E forms with E boards supporting PCIe Gen 5 for storage and graphics while non-E boards support PCIe Gen 5 via an M.2 SSD only.

There is no functional performance difference between the chipsets with regards to CPU or memory performance as was the case with AM4. But the key difference comes in terms of the quantity of features provided.

Technically X670 is actually a dual-chip chipset to allow it to offer more features and connectivity than the single-chip B650. B650 halves the number of USB 2.0 and 10Gbps ports supported by default. There’s also just the single 20Gbps USB link compared to X670’s potential for two.

General purpose PCIe 4.0 lanes are cut from 12 to 8. You’ll notice this is the only connectivity that isn’t halved and I’d wager this is because a PCIe Gen 4 x4 link is reserved for chiplet-to-chiplet connectivity on the X670 chipset. And the allowance for an added slice of motherboard-configurable PCIe 3.0 or SATA 6Gbps IO is sliced in half.

In essence you don’t really lose all that much useful IO for B650 as a mainstream non-workstation non-storage-crazy user. The key downside is that you’re likely to miss out on front panel 20Gbps USB Type-C if motherboard vendors choose to stick the one port on the rear IO instead or vice versa.

Appearance-wise this £380 ATX motherboard is styled very well in my opinion. The main colouring is largely dark black but there are sprinkles of colour via MSI’s logos and branding.

One really cool design decision is the inclusion of ports bandwidth and connectivity on the chipset heatsink. Functionally I’d argue that this piece of styling is very good; I like it!

Regarding heatsinks MSI has gone for the big-and-beefy approach. A large slab of metal covers the B650 chipset and this also acts as the hub for some of the M.2 metal strips to be screwed into.

You get an individual strip cooler for the uppermost M.2 SSD slot with thermal pads on both sides. I like this design because it is tool-less through-and-through. As is now common the SSD can be secured via a tool-less latch. But the heatsink can also be removed by pushing a mechanism to free and pop it out of place.

The VRM heatsinks are two large blocks of metal that will aim to cool via their sheer size and heatpipe connection. MSI doesn’t make the best effort to increase surface area via fins but these should be absolutely stellar though particularly with some airflow nearby. And a sizable rear IO cover sits atop the ports on blends into the VRM heatsink.

The B650 Carbon WiFi uses a 6-layer 2oz copper PCB and feeds a CPU with dual-8-pin connectors.

The primary power delivery system is built around a 16+2+1 stage power delivery solution with Monolithic Power Systems hardware. This uses an MPS2123 / MP2857 PWM controller and there are MPS 2206 / MP87670 DrMOS power stages that are 80A rated.

This is a proficient power delivery setup from a hardware perspective.

The primary PCIe x16 slot is steel-reinforced for graphics card usage. This runs at PCIe Gen 4 x16 bandwidth whereas the other full-length slot runs at Gen 4 x4 bandwidth.

We know single-GPU is the go-to these days. And that’s a good thing given that modern graphics cards with their ludicrous 4+ slot coolers will leave only the bottom PCIe 3.0 x1 slot accessible.

One clear missing feature is any form of quick or easy release latch or button for the PCIe graphics slot. This is genuinely a problem given the proximity of the PCIe slot tab to the large M.2 cooling plate. I’m disappointed by MSI’s lack of this feature on a £380 motherboard!

Regarding M.2 connections that top slot runs at PCIe Gen 5 x4 from the CPU lanes. There are two more CPU-fed M.2 slots running at PCIe Gen 4 x4 and the fourth M.2 is PCIe Gen 4 x4 from the B650 chipset.

Onboard connectivity is an area where B650 comes in light versus X670. But MSI still offers plenty of options.

You get six SATA ports which I think is sensible for this market segment though just the one 5Gbps USB header may cause a hiccup for some. The front panel USB-C header runs at 3.2 Gen 2 so is not uber speed – the 20Gbps port is on the rear IO.

Seven total fan headers is awesome particularly with MSI’s smart distribution. And three addressable plus a single standard RGB header is ample.

MSI also includes some debug LEDs near the 24-pin which are ideal for troubleshooting. There are no onboard buttons though which is fine for this board’s audience.

Audio runs from the Realtek ALC4080 codec.

The rear IO is hefty with USB support. There are 9 total Type-A ports 7 of which run at 10Gbps while the remaining pair runs as USB 2.0 for legacy connectivity. The single USB Type-C port is 20Gbps rated.

Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 is delivered by the AMD-branded WiFi chipset while 2.5Gb Ethernet is from a Realtek RTL8125 NIC.

MSI provides the full complement of audio outputs in addition to full-sized DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1.

Sizable BIOS Flash and Clear CMOS buttons on the rear IO are two features I love to see.

MSI’s tried-and-tested UEFI design is found on the B650 Carbon WiFi.

There’s the conventional ‘overview’ page that delivers most information average users would want. This section is quick and easy for viewing current operations and making basic changes.

But jumping into the ‘Advanced’ section opens up a host of user-tweakable options. Notable here is the SSD Secure Erase facility which can be helpful when selling or fixing your SSD. Plus there is a good amount of control over the integrated GPU configuration.

Fan control through MSI Hardware Monitor is strong. Fan control is handled using a 4-point curve system for Smart Control mode or just a single voltage or PWM duty cycle for static – non-smart – speed.

This 4-point mode is good because the maximum fan speed can be set at a true 0-100% range which is excellent if your cooler can do 0 RPM mode or if you feel it is too loud at 100% fan speed. Plus you don’t have lower or upper temperature limits.

So you can keep 0 RPM mode at say 70C CPU temp whilst also forcing the fans to stay below their top speed even at 95C. That is particularly useful for Ryzen 7000 and its 95C running mode.

There is step-up and step-down hysteresis control on all of the fan headers which is superb. Plus all five temperature sensor sources are available to all fan headers including the very handy MOSFET temperature input.

Yes the GUI visual design is clunky and looks archaic. But functionally it is exceptionally good and the actual information displayed via graphics and numbers is useful.

There are plenty of overclocking options for manual tuning users. But being perfectly honest these are likely surplus to requirements given how effective AMD’s Precision Boost 2 algorithm is for Ryzen 7000.

Tweaking the core voltage alongside power and temperature allowances is arguably the best way to overclock these new chips. If you want to do adaptive core ratio overclocking and split it at CCD level that’s possible. There’s ample opportunity to tune the memory. And voltage control options are strong though MSI’s loadline calibration settings need an explanation rather than a great big unhelpful list.

As already noted overclocking via the ‘new’ methods are plausible. For example you can go through with a bunch of Precision Boost Overdrive tweaks in AMD’s usual format. Or you can opt for your own determined PPT allowance to the processor. Or given the discussions over the past days since launch you can set a temperature target for your processor to run at rather than a power-driven metric.

It’s just a shame that there is no clear and concise Eco Mode for the CPU via the UEFI. I would have preferred a 105W TDP and 65W TDP option to be clearly included. Particularly as these TDP-driven Eco modes are consistent across CPUs.

I like MSI’s UEFI overall. It is functionally strong and easy to navigate for the simple features though it does get confusing when going through all of the options sub-pages as there are just so many some of which seem repeated.

The design and general art or rendering seem archaic. But functionally the interface is proficient.

We will be outlining the MSI MPG B650 Carbon WiFi motherboard’s performance with the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X CPU 32GB of 6000MHz CL30 DDR5 memory and a Sapphire Radeon RX 6950XT Nitro+ Pure graphics card.

Cinebench R23



Blender Benchmark

7-Zip Benchmark

Computational performance from the MSI B650 Carbon WiFi closely resembles that of the Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master. This is a positive for the cheaper B650 board and serves to validate AMD’s claims that there is no inherent CPU-related performance difference between the chipsets.

AIDA64 Engineer

Sandra Memory Bandwidth

Focusing on memory MSI’s B650 offering is very slightly behind the AIDA bandwidth of Gigabyte’s more expensive AM5 solution. But there really isn’t much in it for any of the memory tests with our 6000MHz CL30 G.SKILL EXPO DDR5 kit – latency included.

3DMark



If you care about 3DMark’s tests you’re likely to be opting for a higher-end benchmarking-calibre motherboard anyway. The performance differences here are slim and inconsequential to most general users.

Gaming

In terms of actual gaming the MSI B650 Carbon WiFi was consistently a few frames per second slower than the X670E reference board in Borderlands 3. Performance was neck-and-neck in F1 2021 though and Watch Dogs Legion was also roughly similar when factoring in accuracy margins.

M.2 PCIe Performance

We test M.2 PCIe performance using a WD_Black SN850 PCIe Gen 4 SSD.

No issues with the performance from MSI’s CPU-fed M.2 slot. The cooling capability of the sizable metal heatsink seemed good too.

Hopefully it won’t be too long before PCIe Gen 5 SSDs are available for us to do proper AM5 SSD speed testing.

Stock Clocks

Out-of-the-box MSI’s B650 Carbon WiFi has no problem running the power-hungry Ryzen 9 7950X at its 230W package power allocation. The 95C temperature target is generally hit quickly so the actual power delivered ramps down.

But our chip still ran at roughly 5.1GHz all-core on this MSI B650 board which is roughly the same as the premium X670E Gigabyte option we tested.

Clocks and Tweaking

Manual overclocking is not really a particularly effective way to run the Ryzen 7000 series processors currently or so is the general consensus. This is because AMD’s Precision Boost 2 algorithm is so effective by default.

As such we listened to the feedback on our previous videos and decided to test with Eco Mode. MSI’s UEFI does not provide a clear way of running Eco Mode so we used Ryzen Master instead.

Reducing the chip down to 65W TDP resulted in an all-core clock speed of roughly 3.9-4.0GHz. Unsurprisingly the motherboard handled this without hassle.

Another area of interest in our previous videos was the ability to run in temperature target mode.

We selected 85C temperature target in the UEFI and this resulted in the processor running at a little over 5GHz on average. That was roughly a 0.1GHz drop versus the stock 95C temperature mode but with the benefit of lower thermals if that’s what you are aiming for.

Overclocked Performance

Judging by the performance numbers the reduced temperature target running mode is highly efficient at maintaining much of the Cinebench performance whilst reducing operating thermals to a level that some people may be more comfortable seeing.

Not that 95C is an issue for Ryzen 7000 whatsoever. Particularly with MSI’s granular fan control in the UEFI that takes CPU cooling noise problems out of the 95C equation when running fans from the motherboard.

System Power Consumption

Power looks to be an area where MSI’s B650 Carbon WiFi shows some slight weaknesses versus the much more expensive X670E reference board and its beefier VRM configuration.

The MSI offering actually pushes less power to our Ryzen 9 7950X package. This is good given that a similar all-core frequency was maintained.

However the wall power draw was higher despite lower power going through to the CPU. The implication here is that MSI’s VRM is slightly more stressed and therefore operating less efficiently. But that’s not an issue for a cheaper board versus the performant Gigabyte reference point.

System Temperatures

VRM cooling performance from the MSI B650 Carbon WiFi is very good.

Shifting more than 200W of power through to the CPU this 16+2+1 stage power delivery solution still manages to keep MOSFET temperatures well in check. The nearby PCB temperatures that we recorded were absolutely fine too so clearly MSI’s chosen components and 6-layer quality PCB are working well.

Even the demanding 30-minute load test was fine from a VRM cooling perspective. Those large blocks of heatpipe-connected metal atop the power stages are doing their job competently.

The MSI MPG B650 Carbon WiFi is a well-designed motherboard that gives us a glimpse of what premium B650 will look like.

Sporting a highly overbuilt power delivery solution with ample cooling we had no issues pushing the power-hungry Ryzen 9 7950X on this mainstream-chipset motherboard. The feature set is strong – ample high-speed networking connectivity quad M.2 connections and six SATA ports should suffice for most people.

One downside however is the single 20Gbps USB port is deployed in Type-C form on the rear. I know that B650 as a chipset is limited to a single port in terms of 20Gbps USB connectivity but with this board’s £380 price tag being firmly in X670 territory that second high-speed USB will be missed in my opinion. Particularly if you have a case that can do high-speed USB on the front IO.

Fan control abilities within MSI’s UEFI are superb. Yes the whole UEFI design feels aged and clunky. But the functionality of the 4-point fan curve system with multiple temperature sources and a proper speed curve range is superb! Particularly with the whole 95C Ryzen 7000 operating temperature because you are free to tune your CPU cooler and chassis fans away from their loud full-speed values if you so desire.

In isolation there is no doubt that the MSI B650 Carbon WiFi is a premium motherboard that ticks many boxes. But I also feel like it is a bit of a tough sell in many respects.

A £380 asking price for a B650 motherboard is simply too much. This is higher than the current price of all of the X670 motherboards available on Overclockers UK and the X670 chipset offers far greater connectivity. Plus this MSI board’s price point is a tough sell for a non-E chipset offering when even X670E alternatives running PCIe Gen 5 graphics support are less than £400.

The MSI MPG B650 Carbon WiFi certainly has a lot going for it. The design is smart build quality and component choice is very good and the fan control system through MSI’s UEFI is superb. But at £380 in the UK this is going to be a tough sell as a B650 offering that costs more than some of the X670E flagship chipset alternatives.

To be perfectly blunt we like this motherboard but we are more interested in the sensibly-priced B-chipset options.

Discuss on our Facebook page over HERE.

Pros:

Well-designed power delivery solution

Strong VRM and M.2 cooling

Excellent fan control through the UEFI

Quadruple M.2 slots of at least PCIe Gen 4 x4

High-end audio codec

Cons:

Only one 20Gbps USB connection

No clear Eco modes via the UEFI options

No quick/easy release PCIe button/latch

A B650 motherboard at X670/X670E pricing

KitGuru says: The MSI MPG B650 Carbon WiFi is an undeniably premium motherboard irrelevant of its deployment of AM5’s entry-point – B650 – chipset. If you value the core features and build quality this is a great motherboard. But it’s a tough sell when feature-rich X670 options are often cheaper.

Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX) – the company behind the Bang Energy drinks brand – has filed for bankruptcy.

In a press release on Monday (11 October) VPX confirmed it was pursuing Chapter 11 protection in the US state of Florida a move it claimed would allow it to reorganise and regain market share from domestic rivals.

The company recently lost a US$293m lawsuit for false advertising to rival Monster Beverage Corp.

“This filing is a restorative action to help the company recover from recent challenges including multiple lawsuits that impacted the Company’s short-term outlook” a VPX statement said.

“VPX intends to use the Chapter 11 process to recapitalise and emerge from bankruptcy well-positioned to continue its rapid growth in the beverage market.”

Under the terms of a Chapter 11 filing in the US the debtor is allowed to continue business operations (subject to the court’s jurisdiction) whilst it reorganises its affairs and confirms a plan with its creditors. VPX said on Monday that the filing would have “no impact (on) product availability customer orders or operations”.

The brand was previously distributed by the CSD giant until a spat between the two companies ended with VPX CEO Jack Owoc claiming PepsiCo “engaged in a premeditated plan to destroy Bang from day one”. PepsiCo has since bought into another energy drinks company Celsius Holdings.

“We are excited about our future and particularly the new distribution system that we have spent the better part of this year assembling” said Owoc. “Utilising our new state-of-the-art DSD will allow Bang Energy to get back to our pre-Pepsi meteoric annual success of several hundred percent year over year growth.

“This company was founded on determination and a relentless passion for giving our customers and consumers what they want – and we will continue do so. I know we will successfully emerge from this process as a stronger company.”

In August speculation was rife that another CSD company – Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) – was in talks to buy VPX. Unnamed sources told Bloomberg a deal could be valued at more than $3bn although another source said the price would be closer to $2bn.

KDP subsequently poured cold water on the claims and Owoc later confirmed no deal was in the pipeline adding he “would never sell Bang Energy” for that amount.

To attract investors Kinshasa hosted an unprecedented conference designed to explore the country's economic potential.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is a key player on the African continent with one of the strongest growth rates in the sub-Saharan region. Euronews went to the Congolese capital Kinshasa to observe an 'unprecedented' conference designed to explore the country's economic strengths and weaknesses.

Balancing the country's risks and advantages

The aim of the ""Country Risk Conference"" is to guide investors by sifting through the strengths and weaknesses of the country.

Major players in the regional political and economic spheres have gathered in the DRC around a report written by the pan-African rating agency Bloomfield.

Various information was analysed: macroeconomic data as well as social and security data culminating in the country receiving a rating of 5.1 out of 10.

Stanislas Zézé CEO of the Bloomfield Investment corporation said: ""The rating of 5.1 represents moderate risk a median moderate risk. It means that the D.R.C. is a country with a lot of potential with reforms that are being implemented but also with weaknesses.""

Combating economic challenges

Among these weaknesses are the lack of infrastructure security risks in the east and problems with corruption.

However recently the international rating agencies Moody's or Standard and Poor's raised the country's sovereign rating. This signals that the country's economic situation is improving and the Minister of Finance is determined to strike while the iron is hot and continue this wave of change.

Nicolas Kazadi said: ""In terms of public finance we have an extremely ambitious roadmap that we are implementing as part of the program with the IMF. It is essentially to improve revenue transparency tax reforms to create a more favourable business environment and also to fight against corruption particularly through the strengthening of digitalization in public finance both in terms of revenue and expenditure.""

Diversifying the D.R.C's economic portfolio

The International Monetary Fundreported that the Democratic Republic of Congo saw an over 4.5% economic growth in 2021 thanks in large part to the country's mining and service sectors.

The mining sector remains the essential engine behind Congolese growth as the country has key resources for the energy transition such as copper cobalt and lithium.

CEO of the ERG group one of the largest investors in these activities believes in the country's enormous potential.

""If you have a mobile phone there is a 100% certainty that a small part of the battery is from the DRC. It is also the only country that is going to be able to supply sufficient materials to supply the incredible amount of materials that will be required by the electronic sector or transportation sector: electric vehicles stationary batteries or energy storage. The numbers that you are looking at are enormous."" Benedikt Sobotka CEO of Eurasian Resources Group

Beyond the DRC's mineral wealth the country also boasts vast arable lands which offer opportunities for the agricultural sector.

Entrepreneurs seizing opportunities

Tisya Mukuna creator of ""La Kinoise"" a Congolese coffee brand is the embodiment of a new generation of entrepreneurs who are determined to get the country moving.

Three years ago she became the first to cultivate organic coffee in the Kinshasa region making the most of what the land has to offer.

Tisya Mukuna founder of ""La Kinoise"" Euronews

This summer Mukuna opened a small factory to roast and package her coffee on site in the capital however she has faced some challenges caused by environmental factors such as heavy rain.

She told Euronews that growing coffee is ""a story about passion"" which she pursued ""even when everyone told [her] it was impossible.""

From harvesting to packaging Tisya intends to control the entire production chain of this 100% local coffee business which requires energy and perseverance.

The hardest part was the industrialization process: finding the machines importing them. The hassles with customs. Setting them up. It's also a story of energy having the electricity to run this factory. It's a lot of ambition. It requires a rather stable ecosystem. Take the case of the plantation: when it rains the roads leading to the plantation are immediately unusable. So this is all part of an ecosystem that adds difficulties for the company. But it's not impossible: the proof is that today we are present in four cities across Congo. Tisya Mukuna Founder of ""La Kinoise""

Tisya aspires to make her coffee known and have it sold beyond the borders of the DRC an entrepreneur who provides an example to those who want to invest in the country and seize its opportunities for the future.",,,,,,,,,

Barry J. Martzahl who had been part of Morgan Stanley’ Graystone Consulting unit registered with Nicolet Advisory Services the RIA division of a Green Bay-based Nicolet National Bank on October 6 according to licensing records.

Martzahl’s arrival comes just shy of two months after his departure from Morgan Stanley on August 18 according to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s IAPD database.

Morgan Stanley fired him for “concerns relating to interactions with co-workers” and an issue related to “information” he had included in a portfolio performance report sent to customers without approval according to a record of termination notices maintained by state securities regulators.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment on the circumstances behind the concerns. The firm specified in the U5 notice that the behavioral issues were not related to sexual harassment or discrimination. The material he had included in the performance report did not contain misleading or inaccurate information the firm noted.

Morgan Stanley’s Graystone unit includes 60 teams who manage more than $450 billion in institutional assets including for public and private corporations foundations and endowments according to its website.

Martzahl did not immediately return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn and could not be reached through Nicolet’s web directory which lists 23 financial advisors. A Nicolet spokesperson confirmed the hire but declined to elaborate on how it evaluated the U5 filing.

In another example of the curse of top-broker lists Martzahl had been ranked as #3 in Wisconsin this year by Forbes which said he managed $1.7 billion in assets as of April and had a $1 million minimum account size. He was also a perennial figure on Barron’s list of the top 1200 brokers in the country from 2014 to 2021.

Barron’s had placed his team assets at $3.3 billion and a $2 million minimum.

Nicolet managed $1.4 billion in advisory assets as of the end of 2021 according to its most recent Form ADV filing.

Martzahl started his career at Morgan Stanley’s E.F. Hutton & Co. predecessor in 1985 and remained at through successive mergers according to his BrokerCheck record.

Another member of the team Eric R. Martzahl Barry’s son registered with Nicolet on September 26 four days after he left the wirehouse according to the IAPD database. He has seven years of experience and joined Morgan Stanley in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlcmVuZXdzLmNvbS9tc3JlaXMtcGFzc2luZy1vZi10aGUtdG9yY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSREI's passing of the torch,"Nearly there!

According to an internal memo Paul Barker has today joined BNP Paribas as a senior trader in the division after also previously serving in the single stock trading teams at Citi and Morgan Stanley.

BNP Paribas said Barker’s addition reflected its ambition to building a leading flow trading team in Europe.

The bank has continued to build out its single stock trading team in Europe in the last year including three other new hires. Ashish Arora joined the team from JP Morgan in January earlier this year while Thomas Barry and Duncan Chiah were also appointed onto the team from Citi and Bank of America respectively in 2021.

“These recent big changes to the profile of BNP Paribas’s equities franchise demonstrates the bank’s commitment to developing and sustaining a global equity business” said BNP Paribas in a statement.

The expansion of its single stock team follows several major moves by the bank to bolster its equities business including consolidating Exane BNP Paribas on 1 July last year and completing the transfer of Deutsche Bank’s prime brokerage and electronic execution business at the end of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5zdXJhbmNlbmUud3MvaHVycmljYW5lLWFkZHMtdG8tcmVpbnN1cmVycy1jYXBpdGFsLWRyYWluLWluLXEzLW1vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hurricane adds to reinsurers' capital drain in Q3: Morgan Stanley,"Analysts at Morgan Stanley have stated that this year’s third quarter will be challenging especially as Hurricane Ian has highly contributed to capital drain.

According to analysts Q3 2022 started off as a quiet quarter from a catastrophe perspective in the US with no land-falling hurricanes through the first two months. This ended with Hurricane Ian whose estimated insured losses place it as the second costliest hurricane after Katrina.

In its latest report Hurricane Ian Estimates Have Wide Range; A Few Notable Events Internationally Morgan Stanley has noted that the higher end of these estimates only seems likely should a certain number of factors line up.

It said: “Outside the U.S. there were a number of medium-to-large sized events including Fiona Namadol and French Hailstorms each in the low to mid billions of insured losses. We expect reinsurers as well as those internationally exposed to see a larger share of the quarter’s cat load.

“Excluding cats our EPS estimate revisions were relatively minor. On average we estimate ~4.4% operating ROE and -10.2% sequential BVPS decline in the quarter (MTM & Cats). For P&C brokers we estimate average organic growth of +6.3% (down from +6.5% in 2Q22).”

According to analysts in a quarter already bruised by significant MTM write- downs losses caused by Hurricane Ian have served as a “double-whammy hit” to reinsurer’s equity.

Analysts said: “At the recent reinsurance rendezvous conference in Monte Carlo we heard a clear bifurcated message: some reinsurers taking a pause on property cat business to pursue diversification in other markets (primary insurance casualty reinsurance) while other reinsurers saw the current prop cat market as attractive enough to pursue (see our note here).

“The equity hit in 3Q will bring that differentiating strategy more clearly in focus but regardless which way any one particular reinsurer leans we think as a group reinsurers are in the driver’s seat as we enter 2023.”

Regarding commercial lines Morgan Stanley expects a continued pricing deceleration for most of them but given some carriers saw a positive inflection in 2Q coupled with continued pressure from inflation positive pricing trajectory may continue for a few the firm noted.

It said: “While margins remain healthy we expect to see pressure as the gap between rate vs. trend narrows.

Analysts added: “Seeing similar focus on personal auto with expectations for majority of players to see greater rate increases in 3Q and 2H more generally than 1H in order to catch-up with elevated frequency and severity. However pricing for most has yet to earn in and as such we expect continued margin pressure in the near-term.”"

Significant flooding and high winds were experienced throughout central Florida during the storm and this caused modest damage to Mosaic Company facilities and supporting infrastructure.

Early assessments indicate phosphate production could be down by approximately 200000-250000 metric tons split roughly evenly between the third and fourth quarters of 2022. Repairs are expected to be completed over the next couple of weeks.

In addition to production impacts the timing of shipments was also affected by the storm. Phosphates sales volumes in the third quarter are now expected to total 1.60-1.65 million metric tons as port and rail closures delayed late third quarter shipments to October.

Mosaic plans to provide further updates when it reports third quarter results. The Mosaic company produces fertilizers in West Central Florida where Hurricane Ian made landfall late last month.

It is a story that is kept out of history books because it is the brutalization of a Black teenage boy from Chicago who did not return home alive from a trip to Mississippi. Emmett Till whose nickname was “Bobo” was visiting his family in the summer of 1955 when he whistled at a white woman working at a store. This simple action led to his kidnapping and torturous murder. The death of Emmett Till was one of the factors that led to the historic civil rights movement across the South.

The collaboration between Bayeza Wilks and the phenomenal actors acknowledges the voices of history that should never be forgotten.

Knowing the story and seeing it come to life on stage is like reading a book and already knowing the ending. It is not about the end but the journey of who Emmett Till was before his wrongful murder at fourteen years old. His life before his death needs to be told and remembered. The play is the first part of a trilogy presented by the Mosaic Theater Company and recalls the last two weeks of his life. Written by Ifa Bayeza it is directed by Talvin Wilks. The collaboration between Bayeza Wilks and the phenomenal actors acknowledges the voices of history that should never be forgotten.

The play’s first scene begins with a beautiful harmonization about the spirit of Emmett Till and the power of his name. The ensemble cast of five along with Antonio Michael Woodard who plays Emmett Till envelope the stage with church-like essence by praising the life the young boy had before his murder. The ensemble actors Billie Krishawn Rolonda Watts Jaysen Wright Jason Bowen and Vaughn Ryan Midder remind the audience that Till was an innocent child loving the life that he had.

As Emmett Till Antonio Michael Woodard delivers a powerful performance by embracing the youthfulness of a young child. His embodiment of Till depicts true Black boy joy in 1955. His character is seen dancing on stage with Billie Krishawn (Mamie Till-Bradley) joking around with his best friend Wheeler (Jaysen Wright) mocking his family members having crushes on girls speaking his mind stuttering and other childlike antics. The story goes into detail about the culture shock he faced traveling from Chicago to Mississippi and how children in the south grew up differently than children in other parts of the country. All the actors should be commended for balancing a heart-wrenching story with moments of joy. To tell this story takes a strength that goes beyond words.

The audience must remember that this story is not fictional. Emmett Till’s death still haunts communities around America and has impacted families for generations. These stories of pain should not be glorified but a call to action against racism in this country.

Running Time: 90 minutes with no intermission.

Advisory: Racial violence racial slurs and brutality.

“The Ballad of Emmett Till” and the rest of the trilogy runs through November 20 2022 at The Mosaic Theater Company at Atlas Performing Arts Center 1333 H Street NE Washington DC 20002.

Burnett Photos Courtesy Heritage Auctions

DALLAS – Heritage Auctions conducted its Pursuit of Beauty: Art Nouveau Art Deco & Art Glass Signature® Auction on September 28 totaling $1192040. Tiffany Studios and R. Lalique pieces competed for the most top lots but other makers also made the upper ranks of this 456-lot sale. In addition to lamps and vases historic glass from landmark buildings of the era were offered by Heritage Auctions in this stately sale.

The star of the auction was a group lot of six rare mosaic panels depicting signs from the Western Zodiac made by Tiffany Studios for the Marshall Field & Company in Chicago including Favrile glass tiles that were also salvaged at the time of their removal. Tiffany began producing its mosaic panels for ecclesiastical and public spaces later applying the medium to commercial and domestic spaces. These panels including Aquarius Libra Leo Cancer and two Capricorns were part of what was then considered “the largest piece of mosaic glass in the world” installed in the new Marshall Field & Co building. Designed by D.H. Burnham & Company and opened in 1907 the ten-story Classical Revival monument to luxury occupies an entire city block and is still one of the largest department stores in existence. In 1914 Marshall Field commissioned Louis Comfort Tiffany to design the ceiling above the Men’s Grill in its new Store for Men. The tiles composed a massive 40-by-50-foot leaded glass dome above an extravagant central fountain joining more than one million glass tesserae that took 50 men and 18 months to install. These panels “were a joy to handle” according to Samantha Robinson consignment director of decorative arts and design and led the sale at $57500.

No Art Nouveau glass sale would be complete without a salon full of Tiffany lamps but the only floor lamp in the top lots was also the auction’s second highest lot. At 78 overall inches the leaded bronze and patinated glass lamp from Tiffany Studios was made circa 1910 and signed on its shade and base. The Curtain Border shade contained yellow and blue-dappled mosaic glass with spiral detailing on its base. The lamp achieved $52500. The third highest lot was also the only example of its form a hanging Tiffany Studios lamp from the same era with a Dogwood pattern which sold for $45000. Another circa 1910 Tiffany table lamp with marks to its Linenfold shade and base folded at $16250.

Two more Tiffany lamps were sold both with lobed Lily pendants made with Favrile glass circa 1910. Each of these lamps have similar examples in Alistair Duncan’s Tiffany Lamps and Metalware: An illustrated reference to over 2000 models (2007). The Lily shades were all marked “L.C.T. Favrile” and their bases showed the appropriate Tiffany marks. The first in the sale was a 10-light table lamp with a patinaed bronze in the shape of lily pads reaching $28750. The second had the same base but only seven Lily lights which earned $21250.

The only lot of decorative Tiffany glass was a decorated paperweight vase made from Favrile glass circa 1950. An early example of the studio’s Agate designs the decoration showed abstracted leaves and vines in teal lapis and green along with swaths of cream and ochre and encased in clear glass. The vase paperweight was in overall good condition with a few short barely perceptible surface scratches on the shoulder and bid to $31250.

Glass from René Lalique also joined the upper lists of this sale with the maker’s vases being most popular among bidders. The highest achieving of these was a Perruches cased vase in a rare red color circa 1919. The vase was in overall very good condition with no chips cracks or restoration and sold for $30000. Another vase in the same Perruches form but in electric blue glass with one fleabite to the tail of one parakeet followed at $25000. Between the Perruches vases lurked another Lalique but this vase was in the form of a coiled serpent with its jaws open. Made with amber glass circa 1924 the vase was in overall good condition. It struck at $27500.

Twelve bronze sculptures were included in the sale and the highest selling was the only example that lacked the sinuous lines and idealized forms of most Art Nouveau and Art Deco sculpture. “Tête d’homme” was cast in 1914 by the Guss Barth Rinteln foundry after Joseph Csaky who was born in Hungary then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire then traveled by foot to Paris to pursue an artistic career after an early career in ceramic and metalwork factories. He joined the artist’s collective La Ruche in Montparnasse and began to carve sculptures in stone. Csaky was a contemporary with Alexander Archipenko and Pablo Picasso in the Cubist movement and his work is considered to be a substantial contribution to modern nonrepresentational sculpture. The bronze sold by Heritage was modeled after Csaky’s 1913 “Tête d’homme” a plaster sculpture that was exhibited widely in Paris and Geneva and is now lost. The bust was originally bought from the artist’s estate and went through three private German collections before being bought by its consignor from a New Orleans gallery; it bid to $16250.

Two Daum pieces reached the top lots during this sale. An acid-etched and enameled boudoir lamp sold for $15625 showing a springtime landscape scene that becomes illuminated from an interior bulb when lit. The lamp was marked with “Daum Nancy” and Cross of Lorraine and was also signed by its decorator “B.S.” The lamp was joined by a rare partial-gilt and enameled vase with three handles circa 1895 decorated with storks in a pond with copper leaves. The vase also bore the appropriate marks and came from a private Chicago collection of American and European art glass and bid to $14375.

Another collection of tilework was included in the auction; a rare glazed earthenware fireplace surround from the Grueby Faience Company circa 1902. From the auction catalog “The fireplace was the heart of the Arts & Crafts home – a place to gather as a family and foster unity. As the anchor of the room both visually and socially the fireplace was an opportunity to show off the best design of the time. The star of this surround by the Grueby Faience Company is the charming five-tile Oxen frieze featuring a farmer accompanying an oxen-drawn wagon executed in the rich greens earthy yellows and warm browns Grueby is known for. The rustic scene captures the essence of the Arts and Crafts Movement: simple design made by expert craftsmen that ties together the beauty of nature with the comfort and harmony of a peaceful home. The frieze was originally designed in 1902 for the library fireplace in copper magnate Thomas W. Lawson’s Massachusetts farmhouse Dreamworld. The design pictured in contemporary periodicals became such a hit with clients that Grueby put it into wider production.

Mosaic’s cloud-based platform will integrate directly with Gridstack Fluence’s physical energy storage product. This will allow it to process operating constraints and parameters in real-time and employ advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to generate bids that maximise LAB’s market earnings the company said.

Both LAB and the Luna battery storage system which makes up the other 100MW/400MWh of the project will use Fluence’s operational services packages for performance guarantees and maintenance support.

“By utilising several solutions from our ecosystem of products customers can craft tailored commercial and operational packages that align to their needs” said Fluence President Americas John Zahurancik.

He also said that the units came online at “…just the right time when extreme heat caused spikes in electricity demand and stressed the state’s power grid”.

Fluence’s digital services segment is a small but fast-growing part of the business. In its most recent quarterly results ‘assets under management’ for its ‘digital projects’ segment grew 310% versus 95.7% for ‘energy storage services’ and 62.7% for ‘energy storage product’ deployments. It was also the only segment of the three where orders grew as covered by us at the time.

AES co-founded the company along with technology and engineering firm Siemens and both companies together still hold a majority of its shares after its IPO in late 2021.

McFee is chair and president of Saskatchewan-based Community Safety Knowledge Alliance Inc. which prepared an analysis on police budgeting for Edmonton city council.

""I want to be very clear: I was not involved in the process I was recused from the process"" McFee said during a media availability last week.

The Edmonton police commission hired the CSKA in a sole-sourced contract to write the report which is part of a bundle of information city council requested in the spring.

The group recommends the City of Edmonton return to a funding formula to give police a base budget with automatic increases each year — a process McFee and the police commission support.

""The funding formula that we previously had has allowed us to drive to a significant reduction in crime"" McFee said.

""I think it's a better way to take the politicization and the politics of policing in relation to cost to actually focus on what needs to be done.""

Every other city department submits budget requests for programs and services which council debates publicly before agreeing to the money a process some councillors say shows clear accountability.

In 2020 city council had suspended the formula amid emotional public hearings into policing and police funding following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

During a council meeting last week several city councillors said the chief's involvement with the CSKA seemed to create a conflict of interest.

Arthur Schafer director of the Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics at the University of Manitoba says the entire process is a conflict.

""The police commission made a mind-boggling decision in giving the contract untendered uncompetitive to an organization that consists almost exclusively of chiefs of police"" Schafer said in an interview Monday.

The CSKA website lists seven police services as its members: Calgary Edmonton Greater Sudbury Ottawa Peel Regional Regina and Victoria along with Motorola Solutions Canada.

Question of optics

Coun. Keren Tang said the commission should have asked another third-party expert to prepare the analysis of police budgeting.

""Especially when it comes to policing whether or not the conflict of interest is real or perceived it doesn't really matter"" she said in an interview Monday.

""The optics are so tremendous.""

Council was on the verge of removing the CSKA report from the bundle of information presented on Oct. 3 because of the potential conflict of interest but ultimately voted to keep it as a reference.

McFee considered council's move a sign that the conflict of interest concerns were moot.

Council has held multiple meetings in recent months to deliberate on how police should be funded — a subject set to return during fall budget sessions. (Amber Bracken)

A former deputy minister of justice with the Saskatchewan government McFee called the criticism a distraction and said last week he was confident it was resolved.

""Perception is not conflict"" he added.

Schafer disagrees.

""The process was profoundly guilty of real conflict of interest not perceived conflict of interest"" Schafer said. ""Because the independent advice they needed was sought from an organization that couldn't be further from being independent.""

He said the commission should have consulted groups like the CSKA the police chief and community groups and then have a third-party group write a final report.

Formula controversy

Critics say the funding formula lacks accountability as it doesn't require the police service to clearly show how it spends the money.

Every other city department must submit specific budget requests for each project and justify how they're using the funding.

Other departments have gone through cuts over the past few years a trend that Mayor Amarjeet Sohi has noted in several public meetings and in his social media posts.

On Friday city council agreed to proceed with a funding formula for 2023 with a base budget of $407 million plus a potential $7 million increase based on inflation and population adjustments.

Council stipulated that when it discusses budgeting again next year it will insist on attaching specific criteria to the formula that measures how well police are using the money.

Tang said the CSKA report is just one element to the police budgeting debate. She said it didn't carry substantial weight in council's decision to reinstate a funding formula.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbGFycXVvdGVzLmNvbS5hdS9ibG9nL3NvbGFyLXdpZmktemV0aWZpLW1iMjY2Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar Powered Wi-Fi Project Gets More NSW Government Backing,"by

A company working to bring better connectivity to Australians living or travelling out the back of beyond has scored another injection of NSW Government funding.

On Thursday NSW Minister for Science Innovation and Technology Alister Henskens announced 10 projects will receive funding through Phase 2 of the current round of the Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) program. SBIR is an initiative designed to help small businesses and NSW Government agencies team up on developing solutions to complex problems.

“NSW has a highly innovative small business sector and by supporting these businesses to develop home-grown solutions we can not only improve social and environmental outcomes but boost our innovation economy by creating high-value jobs and growing new high-tech industries” said Minister Henskens.

One of the companies granted funding is Zetifi which was founded in 2019 to overcome the connectivity challenges faced by farmers and rural residents.

Under the Phase 2 SBIR support Zetifi is to develop a proof of concept for its ZetiNet platform. ZetiNet consists of solar-powered wireless network devices and systems that can be rapidly deployed on existing power poles or as standalone “pods”; promising cost effective connectivity where mobile operators cannot reach.

The Zetifi team were pretty pleased with the news of funding but the amount received wasn’t mentioned1.

“ZetiNet reduces the reliance on mobile networks as the main or in some cases only communications option for emergency and other essential services” stated the company. “It’s our way of describing the package of hardware software and networking innovations needed to quickly deploy a network of off-grid small cells so that passers-by can use long-range Wi-Fi to access data from feint (sic) mobile signals or satellites that would otherwise be invisible to them.”

Earlier this year Zetifi completed a $100k feasibility study of its platform funded under Phase 1 of the SBIR. The Wagga Wagga based company has already established some street (or dusty road) cred in rural connectivity tech. Existing products in its portfolio include:

ZetiRover: a roaming Wi-Fi hotspot for vehicles and farm machinery.

ZetiCell: a connectivity solution for farms and rural and remote communities with limited mobile coverage. Drawing a maximum of 24 watts ZetiCell is offered with battery backup and solar panel options.

ZetiBase: an indoor solution combining data connections from multiple 4G carriers or satellite internet services to improve connectivity reliability.

Last year the company expanded into the US market with the opening of a satellite office in Rochester New York. Among its various project partners are Essential Energy Motorola Solutions Telstra SpaceX and Charles Sturt University.

Following this proof-of-concept phase NSW Government agencies will consider procurement of successful SBIR projects.

“The NSW Government is supporting this work for its potential to improve service delivery right across the state in particular those delivered by the NSW Telco Authority” says Zetifi.

Trivia: Australia’s CSIRO lays claim to inventing the wireless LAN (WLAN) patenting the technology behind it in 1996. Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi and all that.

Trivia: According to Energy Networks Australia more than 7 million power poles are in place across Australia.

Footnotes SBIR offers up to $1.1 million in grant funding to develop and commercialise a new technology or service. ↩

In the first half of 2022 public-market volatility coincided with a notable drop in distributions across many Burgiss Manager Universe (BMU) asset classes especially private equity and debt. While capital calls also fell to more normal levels after a busy end of 2021 it is not clear whether these asset classes are making net distributions which could potentially create a problem for LPs with self-funding portfolios. In this blog post we look at recent private-market cash flows and what they could mean for LPs going forward.

Mediating the life-cycle problem for a more realistic portfolio

Raw BMU data provides a simple approach to looking at cash flows: we can take the funds in an asset class and just add the distributions and contributions. Net distributions to LPs which are critical for LPs who manage cash flows are displayed with a black line in the following exhibit. We tend to see signs of seasonality in the data with less cash flow activity in the first quarter (lighter bars) than the rest of the year which is most obvious for the buyout funds.

Quarterly cash flows from BMU funds

Data as of June 2022. Distributions are in green; contributions are in blue. The first quarter of every year appears as a lighter shade. The black line indicates net distributions (distributions minus contributions).

It was challenging to evaluate the drop in cash flows in Q1 2022 because it was unclear how much of the fall was due to seasonal effects. Yet with the newly released second-quarter data we see cause for concern in some asset classes. In particular venture capital’s net distributions have hit a multi-decade low and senior and distressed debt have been calling capital on net. However simply adding up BMU cash flows is probably not the best approach an LP could take.

The BMU uses market weights meaning that each fund is weighted according to its fund size. Private-market vintage capitalization tends to grow over time due to an increase in both the number of funds and the fund size creating a life-cycle problem whereby the market gets younger over time. Younger portfolios will generally produce more capital calls relative to distributions because more funds will be early in the J-curve. While this is the appropriate way to view the market our goal in the remainder of this blog post is to disentangle changes in fund behavior — cash flows — from this demographic effect within a more realistic portfolio.

Mature portfolios offer a more reassuring picture

LPs generally have target allocations that are different from the market even within an asset class. Portfolios often ramp up to a given size with regular annual allocations leading to a steady state as a “mature” portfolio. We reweight the BMU to create such a portfolio — one that emulates an LP allocating USD 100 to each vintage of an asset class.[1]

The following exhibit plots the cash flows from these steady-state asset-class portfolios. Visually the differences between the gross cash flows in the exhibits are subtle but the net-distribution lines differ dramatically for all asset classes except real estate. Correcting for the greening of the BMU in which new vintages with young funds grow relative to previous vintages a somewhat more reassuring picture for self-funding LPs appears.

Quarterly cash flows from BMU funds reweighted for vintage

Data as of June 2022. Distributions are in green; contributions are in blue. Funds are reweighted such that each vintage within an asset class receives a USD 100 commitment emulating a steady-state portfolio. The first quarter of every year appears as a lighter shade. The black line indicates net distributions (distributions minus contributions).

While the net distributions in the steady-state portfolios appear less dire than those in the first exhibit we still see challenges that lie ahead for allocators. Private-equity asset classes generated growing net cash flows for LPs in recent years but this came to an abrupt stop in the first half of 2022 when net distributions were only slightly positive.

Although private-debt net distributions were more mixed over this period these asset classes have become net capital callers. The results are less dramatic in steady state but can still cause strains for self-funding LPs. In contrast real assets appear to be a relative bright spot and while net cash flows in real-asset subcategories are noisy they have been performing reasonably well compared to recent history.

Diversification is more important than ever

BMU cash flows present an interesting view of private markets. For an LP concerned about funding commitments out of distributions however it is important to know that using market weights hides some crucial details. By reweighting the BMU we provided a more useful look at the cash flows of mature asset-class portfolios. These cash flows show signs of trouble for debt portfolios which were net capital callers in 2022.

In contrast real assets have maintained relatively strong net distributions. Finally private equity falls somewhere in between: net distributions were down dramatically after a spectacular 2021 but still slightly positive. With private-capital cash flows giving LPs mixed signals it is more important than ever to maintain a diversified portfolio. Stay tuned to see how a diversified private-asset portfolio would have fared in comparison.

De Paz left China Bank last month after a year with the Philippines’ sixth largest bank.

His new role will involve developing solutions and projects for the growth of ESG and climate business at MSCI. He is tasked to design and improve existing practices and processes and is expected to create data procurement to support the company’s climate datasets.

He will work closely with a global team of researchers focused on climate-related metrics including carbon emissions energy performance and climate change targets and commitments using annual and sustainability reports quantitative data feeds from third-party data providers news publications and other company disclosures.

De Paz brings 15 years of experience in sustainability to his post including having been the environment and sustainability manager at ACEN the energy platform of the Ayala Group senior sustainability manager at business process outsourcing firm ADEC Innovations and environmental and permits superintendent at French industrial company La Farge.

Even in his new role De Paz will continue his work as a part-time lecturer for sustainability international business and innovation subjects at the De La Salle University where he has been teaching business management and entrepreneurship students for close to five years.

De Paz once said to his students: “Future business leaders should learn to communicate sustainability well. Communication is important in creating sustainable impact. Understanding sustainability and its complexities through effective communication is a skill. Just avoid greenwashing or sustainable development goals (SDG)-washing or ESG-washing. It’s equally important that you know what you are talking about.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbGFzc2V0cy5pcGUuY29tL25ld3MvYnJpZGdlcy1mdW5kLXRha2VzLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLWVzZy1hZHZpc29yeS1maXJtLWV2b3JhLzEwMDYyNjI1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bridges Fund takes majority stake in ESG advisory firm Evora,"Specialist impact investor Bridges Fund Management has acquired a majority stake in real estate ESG consultant Evora Global.

The investment includes support from MSCI and Farview Equity which along with Bridges will each take a seat on the Evora board. Financial details were undisclosed.

Evora said the capital from the Bridges Fund-led funding round will help expand its offering to support clients globally while further developing its tech platform.

Founded in 2011 Evora helps real estate companies with their ESG strategies sustainable finance and climate risk management and disclosure both through advisory services and the use of its software.

Evora’s software SIERA currently holds ESG data for over 8000 major buildings globally. Its clients include Invesco Real Estate Hines and M&G.

Chris Bennett Evora co-founder said: “Our client base is made up of leading asset managers and owners and they have been asking us to support them globally. This funding enhances our ability to support them and to improve our technology and advisory services globally.

“We wanted investors who were aligned with our vision. We had a lot of options but Bridges really stood out for its commitment to sustainability and impact investing as well as being a B Corp.

“Working with MSCI will broaden our ability to drive positive impact helping our clients with their sustainable development goals while widening our global reach. Farview’s experience of growing enterprise technology companies will transform our SIERA software and support its international growth.”

Emma Thorne partner at Bridges Fund Management said: “Real estate is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions so Evora’s tools and services can play an important role in reducing emissions and building a more sustainable economy.

“We think there’s a significant commercial and impact opportunity here. So we’re excited to partner with this excellent team and help the business scale drawing on Bridges’s 20 years’ experience of helping ambitious companies to accelerate their growth and achieve more impact.”

René Veerman the head of real assets at MSCI said: “High-quality data is an essential part of commercial real asset investors’ ability to develop effective strategies built upon the in-depth evaluation of portfolio and asset climate risk.

“The combination of Evora’s tools for climate data management and advisory services together with MSCI’s robust climate risk models and indexes will help to improve the flow of critical decision data and accelerate the adoption of climate standards and thereby to strengthen the global real asset investment process.

“MSCI is committed to providing critical decision support tools that help investment managers to build better portfolios and in this collaboration with Evora we will better serve the evolving needs of our shared and new clients.”

Guy Sochovsky partner at Farview Equity said: “We believe meeting the demands of climate change across global real estate portfolios will continue to need powerful software tools able to both track environmental impact and project future economic risks.

“SIERA has many of the right ingredients around data quality and deep industry understanding to enable these features within its software. We are excited to have the opportunity to partner with the team at the company to help realise that vision for the benefit of all stakeholders.”

Despite dramatic repricing (with the MSCI ACWI down 26% and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index down 15% YTD through 9/30/22) there is little optimism that the carnage is over.

We have long said that valuations are stretched and that investors should be cautious when it comes to their level of exposure to market beta. One of the reasons that we remain excited about the long Value vs. short Growth trade is the fact that it is broadly equity beta neutral – a very desirable characteristic in this time of heightened uncertainty. It has been an oasis of positive performance so far in 2022.1 The GMO Equity Dislocation Strategy is our active risk-controlled approach to exploiting the Value-Growth opportunity. The Strategy is long the cheapest Value stocks and short the most expensive Growth stocks and it is approximately beta neutral.

To hypothesize on the future success of this trade it is interesting to consider the potential drivers of relative performance.

Interest rates: No clear link to Value relative performance

A narrative of low rates justifying high valuations for supposedly longer-duration Growth stocks seems to have been a force behind Growth stocks hitting bubble levels. However we do not believe there is an underlying fundamental connection2 and historically there was little correlation (see chart below). If the Market latches onto a narrative investor sentiment and behavior can render it self-fulfilling in the short term; witness the recent dramatic rise in the correlation between yield changes and Value performance. While higher inflation (and rates) began the unwind of the Value-Growth gap our expectations for the future of the Value trade remain grounded in fundamentals and therefore are not predicated on any particular path for rates.

Recession: No clear link to Value relative performance

More recently the Market may have retrained its sights away from interest rate rises and the crosshairs are now highlighting the possibility of a recession. Against this backdrop Growth has actually outperformed Value by a couple of points for the third quarter. There is of course some logic in this as many of the lower-quality and cyclical Value stocks may struggle if we move into a recession. We believe that accounting for the quality of the company when determining whether the stock is cheap or expensive helps mitigate this risk.3 Further it is not obvious that Value would underperform in a recession; in fact historically there’s been a slight tendency for Value to outperform in economic downturns.4

Valuation remains favorable

Crucially what both of those arguments are failing to take into consideration is valuation. We believe that Value will outperform Growth purely and simply because it is priced to do so. While Value has repriced meaningfully relative to Growth this remains an extreme valuation dislocation that we believe is likely to continue to unwind. Value has retraced roughly halfway back to normal so considerable reversion remains to return to the historic median relative valuation (1.0 on the chart below).

As of 9/30/2022 | Source: GMO

Composite Valuation Measure is composed of price/sales prices/gross profit price/book and price/ economic book.

Ultimately valuation is the anchor for investments and there is an inexorable pull back to fair value. We believe Growth will underperform because it is priced for unrealistic expectations and will falter as companies fail to live up to those expectations. Sentiment will shift and the path to continued Value outperformance is unlikely to be a straight line. We have seen this before5 and are reasonably sanguine about it not least because the emphasis on quality and the risk-controlled approach to portfolio construction in the Equity Dislocation Strategy may help to smooth out any bumps in the road ahead.

ESG stands for incorporating environmental social and governance standards into investing and look for companies mindful of their impact on various stakeholders and also how ESG issues can impact their own long-term growth and value.

In India ESG funds today account for just ₹10800 crore of investor assets. Bulk of these assets have come over last two years with assets under management (AUM) seeing nearly four-fold jump.

ESG scores by rating agencies are used by institutional investors to understand the company’s standing on the ESG standards. But ESG ratings alone may not be the best indicator. As an ESG expert puts it asset managers do their own due diligence and at times use ratings to engage with companies on any red flags.

Different approaches

With ESG ratings there are differences in methodologies as well as terminologies used by different rating agencies.

For example MSCI uses a letter-grading system to differentiate companies that are leaders average or laggards on their ESG scale. MSCI uses a 0-to-10 scale which is divided into seven equal parts each corresponding to a letter rating ranging from AAA to CCC.

Crisil gives out an ESG score and puts companies into four categories -- leadership strong adequate or below average.

Morningstar Sustainalytics gives risk scores. The higher the risk scores the worse is the company on its ESG scale.

Then there are also differences in what rating agencies see as significant factors to a company’s overall ESG score.

Global vs local

Foreign ESG rating providers (ERPs) have put out ESG ratings for large- and mid-sized Indian companies and domestic ERPs are in the process of covering top 1000 Indian company by market capitalisation. This universe includes large-cap mid-cap and small-cap companies.

Foreign rating providers tend to look at how the company is doing compared to other global entities in the same industry.

Indian rating agencies on the other hand consider the domestic peer group of the company.

“A domestic rating agency is likely to be more attuned to the nuances of the domestic market and the company’s progress on the ESG front within the domestic context"" points out Priyanka Dhingra ESG analyst at SBI Mutual Fund.

“The realities of society in an emerging market will be different from those of the developed market"" said senior executive of a fund house requesting anonymity.

Take the case of the power utility company NTPC. While Morningstar Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Rating flags the company as a high-risk it has been graded as ‘Adequate’ by Crisil (see: table). NTPC has got CCC-grade by MSCI which is its lowest ESG rating.

Clean power generation from renewable energy sources is a major focus area for NTPC and it plans to have 45% (65 gigawatt) of its overall power generation capacity from renewable energy sources. The company has already installed 23 solar power plants in the country with plans to grow its hydro and wind-based energy projects.

Tata Power is another case in point. The company is flagged as a severe-risk company by Morningstar Sustainalytics while it has been graded as ‘Strong’ by Crisil. MSCI has given it BBB-grade which puts Tata Power in its ‘Average’ category.

This is despite Tata Power Solar a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power being among the largest solar power producer in India.

“It also depends upon the policy thrust of the government. For a government in an emerging market economy energy security and social welfare will be of higher priority and they may not penalise coal-based power generation as much as US or Europe. ESG fund managers would look at government’s policy thrust and incorporate that in their investing process"" says Sivananth Ramachandran CFA Director Capital Markets Policy CFA Institute.

“But the question is should the rating providers differentiate between a coal-based power company in India versus Europe. Or is it the job of fund manager to figure out what they want to do in that particular market"" adds Ramachandran.

Future of ratings

Experts say the difference in ratings can actually help asset managers to ask more questions from the company. “Unlike credit ratings which analyse different financial metrics of a company and also have a default event to benchmark the quality of ratings ESG ratings analyse companies on various qualitative parameters. So there are bound to be some differences between the ESG ratings of various agencies"" points out Chandru Badrinarayanan COO of Blue Sky Analytics and member of global policy and reference group of UNPRI.

UNPRI is a United Nations initiative which lays down the six principles for responsible investment. The signatories commit to incorporating ESG issues into their “investment analysis and decision-making process"".

Better disclosures by companies will also help ESG rating providers to make a better assessment of the companies on the ESG front. The level of disclosures by companies also impacts their ESG ratings.

From this financial year (FY23) it is mandatory for the top 1000 companies by market capitalisation to make disclosures under Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). The disclosure rules were effective from last financial year but were on a voluntary basis back then.

Under BRSR listed companies are required to disclose their material ESG (environmental social and governance) risks and opportunities plans to mitigate the risks or adapt to them as well as their financial implications.

In a consultation paper earlier this year Indian market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said that while there were differences between ERPs in their terminologies and methodologies it was important that the methodologies were clearly explained and disclosed as well as the key performance drivers of their ratings so that the investor could understand what was considered or excluded in the analysis.

The regulator has also proposed that for investors like mutual funds ratings focused on ESG-related risks on company fundamentals might be more relevant than those focused on external impact. Sebi wants clear segregation of risk ratings as ‘ESG Corporate risk ratings’ or ‘ESG Financial risk ratings’ to distinguish from impact ratings.

In a separate consultation paper last year Sebi had proposed that scheme information documents (SIDs) of ESG funds disclose if they are using any external ESG ratings and methodologies or following their internal frameworks.

Should you invest in ESG funds?

Differences in ESG ratings is not just in India but also in the global market where ESG is a fairly new investment strategy. A recent paper published by researchers from MIT and University of Zurich showed that correlation of ESG ratings between various global rating agencies was 0.38 to 0.71 with 1.00 indicating perfect correlation and -1.00 perfect negative correlation.

Amit Bhatia founder Aspire Circle and Aspire Impact says “While our ESG rating systems have not yet fully settled down India should think of taking the lead and leapfrogging to full impact to get ahead in the race. We have designed these standards with end-user ESG and Sustainability Impact in mind.""

ESG and sustainable investing has gained more investor interest in the last two years after the Covid-19 outbreak. Seven of the nine ESG funds in India were launched after 2020.

Given the differences in the ESG rating system and differing interpretation of ESG issues ESG funds are likely to have varied portfolios and hence varied performances. As ESG funds are yet to build a long track record as a category it would be better for investors to wait till a track record gets built.

XP Inc. a leading technology-driven platform and trusted provider of low-fee financial products and services in Brazil has sought to transform the Latin American market for local investors by providing greater access and transparency to innovative investment vehicles with a global reach.

“XP has a mission to democratize traditional investments bringing financial education to the everyday Brazilian investor and the

sophisticated institutional investor alike” said Jennie Li equity strategist at XP. “We want to give the opportunity for investors to have the most complete and most diversified portfolio possible.”

“Brazilian investors have traditionally been focused on local securities and funds and we wanted to change that a little bit” noted Camila Pacheco funds product analyst at XP. “So we looked for global indices that could provide access to worldwide brands…and Nasdaq is a big part of that. We wanted to bring [forth a] U.S. index with a touch of innovation and we thought that w was a very good representation of that.”

In May 2021 XP (NASDAQ: XP) launched the Trend ETF Nasdaq 100 Index Investment Fund (NASD11) allowing investors in Brazil to access some of the world’s most innovative companies that comprise the Nasdaq-100 Index®.

“Our collaboration with Nasdaq underlines our shared commitment to transforming the financial services industry through innovation and making investment available to all” Fabiano Cintra XP’s international funds specialist said at the time of the fund’s launch.

The Nasdaq-100 Index® tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq including Apple Microsoft and Alphabet and other category-defining companies on the forefront of innovation such as Moderna and Zoom. Since its inception over 35 years ago the Nasdaq-100 Index has become one of the world’s preeminent large-cap growth indexes outperforming the S&P 500 Index in 11 of the last 14 years.

“Investors were so excited with that launch [NASD11] and they’re still very excited with it” said Pacheco. “Institutional and retail investors are always interested in Nasdaq because there are always comparisons between Nasdaq-100 and the S&P 500.”

XP strives to keep its customers at the forefront of all of its strategic decisions listening to investors to determine what products might be missing from the Latin American markets and subsequently working to bring those to market. Issuing the Trend ETF Nasdaq 100 Index Investment Fund fulfilled an immediate need as investors didn’t “have access to growth stories that are very strong outside of Brazil” Li noted.

XP’s strategic endeavors are driven by four core pillars: open-mindedness entrepreneurial spirit and dreaming big all of which are tied to the fourth pillar providing the best services for their clients.

As part of this mission XP has expanded its product suite to include some of the most transformative investment vehicles including funds focused on biotech crypto semiconductors water and more. For instance XP’s Trend Biotechnology is a thematic fund of the XP Trend family focused on international investments with exposure to the Invesco Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBBQ) which tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index®. Through this fund investors have the opportunity to allocate capital to technologies and innovations in the areas of Genetics Pharmaceuticals Diagnostics Prosthetics and Health. Similarly the Trend SemiConductors FIM is a fund that provides exposure to the performance of the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ) comprised of the 30 largest U.S.-listed semiconductor stocks included in another index offered by Nasdaq (the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index™).

XP has also ventured into newer areas within the capital markets through Trend Next Generation FIM and The Hashdex 40 Nasdaq Crypto Index FIC FIM. The latter is a passive fund that provides investors with 40% exposure to the Nasdaq Crypto Index™.

Meanwhile the Trend Next Generation FIM tracks the Invesco Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) comprised of the 101st through the 200th non-financial security with the highest capitalization listed on Nasdaq (the Nasdaq Next Generation 100 Index™).

One of XP’s most unique offerings is the Trend Água Tech fund. As an ESG-themed fund Trend Água Tech provides exposure to the Invesco Water Resources ETF (PHO) which tracks the NASDAQ OMX US Water Index™ that is composed of 36 companies related to water conservation treatment and pricing. With this thematic investment Brazilian investors can construct a portfolio to protect against the risks of climate change related to the scarcity of water resources.

“Brazil has a long history of the financial industry being dominated by a few big players” Li acknowledged. “We want to be a technology-focused company bringing innovation to clients.”

Indian companies have taken the stock market in the United States by storm in the past few years eclipsing even some Chinese stocks as some of the most valuable and growth-oriented businesses in the world. According to a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs this potential is evident from projections that show that the Indian stock market could reach $5 trillion in valuation within the next three years becoming the fifth-largest stock market in the world as investors continue to pour money into the Asian country.

Technology giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been investing heavily in India as well making the country an important part of their future growth strategies. This has inextricably linked the global tech future to the growth in India. Last September Goldman Sachs revealed that initial public offerings (IPOs) by Indian startups in the US had raised over $10 billion a figure set to rise dramatically in the coming years.

Indian Stock Market GDP Set for Explosive Growth in Next Five Years

Analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted that there are at least 150 private firms that could potentially list on the stock market over the next 36 months. These listings would add nearly $400 billion in market capitalization to the stock market per these analysts. This would contribute to lifting the stock market of the country above markets in the United Kingdom and the Middle East. India is home to more than 800 million internet users and has over 500 million smartphone users second only to China worldwide.

Timothy Moe the co-head of Asia macro research at Goldman Sachs told CNBC last year that there were at least 67 private start-ups in India that could be called unicorns a term used to refer to firms that are valued at over $1 billion. Most of these are focused on the digital economy and hit the $1 billion mark in 2021. The share of Indian firms in global stock markets is also rising per the analyst and is expected to climb from 2.8% in 2021 to 3.7% within the next five years keeping pace with the growth in the Indian GDP. He further noted:

“What we’re really flagging here is that as exciting as China was over the last decade when you had this new China story — which is very very profitable and successful for investors – we could see some sort of an analog of that beginning to take place in India.”

In our interview with Mr. Quintana he addressed these concerns and discussed the state of iQSTEL's finances. He explained that although the company was focused on growing steadily and strategically over the long term it remained financially healthy and well-positioned to continue its rapid expansion into new markets. Furthermore he provided insight into iQSTEL's recently filed S1 with the SEC highlighting recent milestones demonstrating the company's continued growth and potential for success. Overall our interview with Mr. Quintana offered a valuable glimpse into the financial health of this dynamic and exciting company:

Q. What is the company's current state of financial affairs?

I should say all the financial information has been adequately disclosed in our filings of forms 10-K and 10-Q; and when there is a significant event that could impact in some way the normal development of our businesses we always disclose those events filling the corresponding form 8-K; which we usually comment simultaneously with a PR. So the company has a full transparency policy regarding our financials and all significant events. At this time there is nothing in particular that we have to mention or make reference to besides the fact that we are actively working on preparing our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30 2022 which will be disclosed in the following due Form 10-Q.

Q. You recently filed an S1 with the SEC and updated it even more recently. Can you please tell us more? And should I be concerned as a shareholder about any potential dilution?

The S1 is an offering statement intended to be used as an instrument to access new funds to finance our M&A campaign if needed. The Company should have at all times a viable tool to access funds to take advantage of new good business opportunities. Our Reg A offering statement reached its “expiration date” last August and the Management thought an S1 was more suitable for a company looking for an up-listing to a national exchange.

Management has been very responsible in managing primary issuances of shares. Suppose a company issues shares and the funds received from the issuance of the shares improve the company's financial results. In that case it creates value for the shareholders even if a dilution occurs. For example we started selling shares of our Reg A late in May 2020. At that time there were more or less 60 million shares issued. From May 2020 to April 2022 we sold 67.5 million shares from Reg A (from the 80 million shares we were qualified to sell). If we compare the financials of the company as of June 30 2020 vs. the financials as of June 30 2022 you will notice we have been creating value for our shareholders even with a dilution of 100% done with the issuance of the shares sold on the Reg A. It will not be different from the S-1 if we use it.

Q. You are projecting 90 million in revenue for 2022. Please confirm that number and explain when you believe the company will reach profitability.

We are confident the Company will reach the projected 90 million in revenue for 2022 and we are on the right path to profitability within the coming few months.

Q. We realize there will be forward-looking projections but based on your best estimates what do you project the company's Financials for 2023?

We dedicate a significant part of our time during the last quarter of the year to preparing the budget for the following year. At this time we are working on the 2023’s budget so it is premature to give you any number but in any case the Company is setting goals to increase revenues increased margins and net profits. Moreover the company has a very clear path of our business objectives that are available for all the shareholders and investors on our website; it´s important to remark that the company has a successful trajectory over performing all the things we promised. Unfortunately the world economic situation has slowed us down on our plans but we have not changed our path. As we always said the company is better than ever.

Q. It appears the deal with Apollo incentivizes them to drive the share price down to acquire shares at a lower price. How is that good for shareholders? With the price dropping each day?

We do not believe one player has the power to drive the market. If Apollo has the power to drive the market down to benefit itself by being able to get more shares based on the structure of the deal then I would expect that it would use that same power to push the share price up to maximize its profits from the sale of the shares they received. If that were so all shareholders would benefit. But again we do not think one player has the power to manipulate the market. What we see in the market is related to the general economic conditions in the U.S. and the entire World. The deal with Apollo is very good for the company because it allows the company to get funding for our M&A campaign if needed. Apollo committed to funding the company with up to $3.8 Million over the next 12 months. This commitment shows how the investors believe in our business plan management and our independent Board of Directors.

Q. For a while there was a lot of talk about the company uplisting to NASDAQ. What happened to that? Is that still possible and if so how?

The Company fulfills all requirements to be listed on Nasdaq except for the minimum required stock price. We believe that within a favorable economic environment the price of our stocks will be driven by the company's performance and not by the influence of the general economic conditions. This one will also pass as has happened with other financial crises in the past. While that happens we are working on having a better company every day with solid and growing revenues improving our gross and net margins. We are building a solid base for the future to come. In that scenario we still believe we can reach the minimum required price in an organic way within an adequate economic environment.

The final message to all shareholders is that the Management Team is the company's main shareholder so every decision we make is made with the best interest of the shareholders in mind. The current price of our stock reflects more the world economic situation because the company's business performance is better than ever. The Management Team founded this company on September 30 2008 (Etelix.com USA LLC) 14 years ago. iQSTEL is a life project for us and we expect to be here for the next fourteen years and beyond!

(End of Interview)

Mr. Quintana’s explanations and insights into the company’s current position and future prospects have reassured us that iQSTEL is a robust and growing company with a positive outlook. We believe in the company and its management team and are confident that shareholders who continue to hold long and strong as iQSTEL enters this next growth phase will be rewarded for their patience. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us Mr. Quintana and thank you to our readers for following along.

Yet arguably they do and in principle a global file system operating across a hybrid and multi-cloud environment is exactly what they need to fix it.

A global file system is one that presents each user with the entire organization’s set of files folders and directories as a single entity – even though the files and folders may be physically stored on different vendors’ filers and in different public clouds in different regions and instance types within those clouds.

A supercloud according to Wikibon is “a set of services abstracted from the underlying primitives of hyperscale clouds (compute storage networking security and other native resources) to create a global system spanning more than one cloud.” The storage part of that is what we mean with the global file system idea.

Global file systems exist within a number of vendors’ offerings. For example NetApp has its data fabric with the ONTAP file system and services running on premises and in the public clouds. Applications and users accessing ONTAP files can use them anywhere there is an ONTAP filer presence. As we said in June: “Customers can move applications using ONTAP to from and between their datacenters and the public clouds and find the familiar ONTAP environment in each.”

Other supplier-specific global file access environments come from CTERA Egnyte Nasuni and Panzura. This group of suppliers started out as general file synchronization-and-share and collaboration suppliers delivering remote access to files stored in the public cloud through cloud storage gateways. This original intent – file sync-and-share – was not congruent with NetApp’s Data Fabric concept.

We wrote four years ago that NetApp’s Data Fabric “aims to deliver a single consistent IT environment in which workloads and applications can move between and use mainstream public clouds and customer on-premises datacenters.”

The four sync-and-sharers have implemented aspects of this by building file-based collaborative data services with local caching. You could replicate this with NetApp’s ONTAP but would need a filer in each location and additional software – a collaboration-focused presentation layer. Evaluator Group consultants say both ONTAP and the cached cloud-based global file systems are capable of providing on-premises file access performance and familiarity with an attached cloud component but they have fundamentally different designs and trade-offs.

Komprise with its Intelligent Data Management platform and data movement capabilities focuses on unstructured data management activities and presents itself as a service to be used by customers along with NAS filers object stores and collaborative file sharing service suppliers – not a replacement for them.

The Nasunis and Panzuras will say that they can replace on-premises and in-cloud filers. Not so says Komprise. It moves files and objects around an existing file object global system estate to optimize overall fie storage and management.

Komprise answers a file management and storage problem. The sync-and-sharers answer a file access problem for remote users. The hybrid filer suppliers like NetApp Qumulo and Dell (PowerScale) answer a file access and lower cost long-term (cloud-based) file storage problem.

Quantum answers a media and entertainment workflow problem with its StorNext set of products supporting distributed and remote workers creating and building complex special effects and video sequences for movies. This in a way is a highly vertical market-specific version of general file-based collaborative work support by CTERA Egnyte Nasuni and Panzura with API-level integration into dedicated applications in the workflow environment.

No one supplier in these four groups of suppliers is answering a general and clear global file system need. Not one built their product in response to that overall need – they built them in response to aspects of it and their offerings partially overlap.

Enter Hammerspace. It has devised a global file system and services in response to its founder’s view that this is what the world needs not point products to fix point problems. But Hammerspace can’t make its major sales pitch that it fixes global file system problems because customers aren’t generally buying it for this purpose. They don’t perceive they have a problem in those terms.

They have specific needs – such as a fast file/object storage on-premises system with the ability to have a cloud-based backend for cool and cold data storage. This could be a situation faced by a Pure Storage sales team or partner. FlashBlade fits the first need but they need a component to fix the second need. Panasas could be selling its storage into an HPC customer and need the same capability. There’s a natural field-level partnering opportunity here between these suppliers and Hammerspace.

So we have five kinds of suppliers all punting products to fix specific problems which all represent examples of global file system products – but with their different focus. As their competition continues and perhaps intensifies will the suppliers make their products more similar?

Will Dell NetApp and Qumulo add remote work collaboration features to compete more effectively against CTERA Egnyte Nasuni and Panzura? Will these four add features to strengthen their entertainment and media video production market appeal? Will Quantum add more general collaboration and lifecycle management features? Could Komprise add more data services to compete with the others? Will Hammerspace add more infrastructure services so partners and customers can use it to compete better with the other groups of suppliers?

It all depends on whether the suppliers perceive that they are competing in a single global file systems market and whether buying customers want products and services that give them a general global file system capability. We think the answers are: first some do and some don’t; and second not yet – but they might.

It doesn’t matter how valid a company founder’s view is of their technology vision nor how architecturally clean or conceptually elegant a particular product is. Ultimately the market – meaning customers – will decide and that means specific problem fixes features price performance etc. All we can do is point out possibilities watch wait and see what happens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2FzaGluZ3RvbmV4ZWMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMjAyMi1waW5uYWNsZS1hd2FyZHMtZmluYWxpc3RzLXVudmVpbGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Pinnacle Awards Finalists Unveiled,"The finalists for WashingtonExec’s 2022 Pinnacle Awards have been announced — and it’s an impressive group of mission-focused industry executives and government officials who work every day to put the technological needs of the nation first.

Co-workers (sorry for not listening Sarah) friends and even the Netflix algorithm itself have been thrusting Derry Girls in my face for years. But why oh why did I not watch sooner?

Finally just last year I dove headfirst into season one episode one and before I knew it I'd flown through all six episodes. (I then immediately dove into season two.)

Read our previous coverage here.

State investigators cited Nevada Gold Mines for failing to follow standard internal safety procedures that could have prevented a fatal accident earlier this year in which an employee with more than a decade’s experience died after falling 60 feet in a company mine.

On the evening of Feb. 14 33-year-old Marissa Hill was driving a 24-foot truck in an underground gold mine at Cortez Hills a sprawling mining complex in rural northeastern Nevada. According to a state investigative report obtained by The Nevada Independent and High Country News Hill entered the underground mine just after 8 p.m. At about 8:45 p.m. she backed the truck off the main track and toward the edge of an expansive open hole or stope from which ore had been excavated. The report found that the backup camera on her truck was disconnected and Hill “backed the truck over the unprotected stope edge falling 60 feet to the bottom.”

Both company policy and federal law required that a berm a protective dirt wall be put up around the edge of the stope which measured about 30 feet wide and 60 feet deep. But there was no barrier in place; a chain was hung around the edge of the pit according to the report and no proper warning signs were near the stope.

About three hours later a site supervisor and mine worker noticed that the chain around the pit had been damaged. Then they saw Hill’s truck upside down at the bottom of the mine. They descended to the bottom and yelled for several minutes calling out to Hill. Over the next 18 hours several attempts were made to remove the truck from the pit. Finally at nearly 6 p.m. the day after the accident workers moved the truck to secure ground at which point the Lander County Sheriff’s Office pronounced Hill deceased according to the report on the accident by the Nevada Mine Safety and Training Section the state’s mining workplace regulator.

The regulators who investigated Hill’s death concluded that Nevada Gold Mines — the state’s largest mining company which is operated by the international mining giant Barrick Gold Corp. — had failed to follow both mining workplace laws and its own written policies. The report details three orders and one notice that the state issued against Nevada Gold Mines. The three orders were classified as an “unwarrantable failure of an operator to comply” with five health and safety regulations. A spokesperson from Nevada Gold Mines declined to respond to a list of questions citing the forthcoming report from MSHA the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.

In response to our request for comment representatives from the company sent a written statement: “We have not yet received the investigation report from MSHA. As we do for any incident however we have already implemented the lessons learnt from the apparent facts and circumstances of this tragic incident across all our operations.”

According to the state’s investigation multiple miners told Nevada safety regulators that several years ago upper management verbally informed them that they could deviate from the company’s written safety requirements and use a chain rather than a berm to protect the edge of the pit. In 2019 according to the report the company updated its policies to require that berms be in place 10 feet from the edge of mine holes of the type that Hill’s truck fell into.

Investigators also found a pattern of inadequate oversight leading up to the accident caused by a hazard that was left unresolved for weeks. The stope in question had been “mined out” in early January yet work inspection documents regarding that part of the mine “failed to identify any barricading hazards” for 39 days before the accident. “After reviewing over 120 work area inspection documents it was apparent that company employees who conducted work area inspections lacked a general understanding of hazard recognition” the report said.

The investigation found further gaps in Nevada Gold Mines’ safety protocols and multiple citations were issued along with noting at one point in the report that the company's “management and supervision are not adequately focusing on ensuring safe work procedures are in place and enforced.”

Within days of the incident Jeff Bixler the chief administrative officer of the Nevada Mine Safety and Training Section said that inspectors found other areas in the Cortez Hills Mine that lacked the required barricading and signage. Bixler said that the state “had those fixed before we left the site” while his agency was investigating Hill’s death. Bixler said the issues identified were “not common at all” throughout Nevada mines: “This was just a really unfortunate accident.”

Under Nevada statutes state regulators can refer orders to the attorney general’s office to seek a penalty in court. Bixler said this is typically done when a company refuses to comply with orders. He added that while the state did not issue financial penalties federal regulators could.

The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration has not released its final report on the fatality. MSHA policy requires berms or guardrails in mines “where a drop-off exists of sufficient grade or depth to cause a vehicle to overturn or endanger persons in equipment.”

State investigators ordered the company to hold multiple training sessions at the Cortez Hills Mine — which employed 279 workers at the time of the report — on berm and barricade policies equipment inspections and identifying hazardous conditions. These trainings which took place in March are detailed in the state’s report.

For months the gold miners interviewed by The Nevada Independent and High Country News have sought answers about Hill’s death. They expressed frustration with the company which they saw as far from forthcoming and they believed that Nevada Gold Mines failed to prioritize workplace safety. In multiple interviews Hill was described as a conscientious and experienced employee who was well-versed in mine safety standards. “She was a goody-two shoes about the rules” a Nevada Gold Mines employee who worked with Hill said speaking on condition of anonymity. “She consistently was by the book on everything.”

Nevada Gold Mines did not respond to a detailed list of questions about the accident and company safety policies.

Nevada Gold Mines was formed in 2019 as a joint venture between multinational mining companies Barrick and Newmont. For years the two companies operated competing large-scale mining operations across northeastern Nevada. The consolidation in 2019 effectively put approximately 75% of Nevada’s annual gold production — and two large workforces — under one roof with Barrick at the helm.

Over the past year The Nevada Independent and High Country News have investigated the consequences of the mega-merger. Multiple workers have chronicled concerns about safety workplace culture harassment and the company’s aggressive tactics in managing its workforce.

Several miners expressed concerns about the company’s focus on prioritizing productivity over safety in the wake of the merger. Barrick operates mines in countries from Tanzania to Papua New Guinea but in an interview this year CEO Mark Bristow acknowledged that Nevada Gold Mines had its worst safety record.

The investigation into Hill’s death echoes the concerns workers have expressed about lax safety standards at the company which employs roughly 7000 workers and about 4000 contractors.

In a recent interview a source familiar with the investigation described a pattern of “hazard acceptance” at the company’s mines. Speaking about the fatality they said that “the problems of deviating from an established procedure — or not being able to verify that those procedures are being followed — is a huge issue.”

“Cultures of safety are built primarily on the level of trust employees have in a company” the source said in an interview. “And people just don’t trust the company. They are afraid to lose their jobs. They are afraid of what’s happening. Because people are expendable under that regime.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmZ0b25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL25ld21vbnQtYWhhZm8tbm9ydGgtcHJvamVjdC1zdGltdWxhdGVzLWxvY2FsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newmont Ahafo North Project stimulates local businesses,"In the same way that mining supports the way we live it also cushions economic growth and development. Mining precious metals like gold has been a major contributor to socioeconomic development in many African economies.

Mining contributes to foreign exchange earnings government revenues employment and gross domestic product (GDP). Ghana is no exception to economies that have and continue to enjoy the socioeconomic impact of that particular extractive sector.

Gold mining in Ghana has been practiced for over a century and involves multinational companies small-scale mining firms and illegal miners also known as ‘galamsey’.

One of the leading multinational mining companies in the industry is Newmont Ghana – a subsidiary of Newmont Corporation the world’s leading gold mining business. In 2002 Newmont acquired its first concession through Normandy Mining Limited. Currently the company operates two mines in the country – Ahafo South and Akyem in the Ahafo and Eastern Regions respectively.

Since it started operations in 2006 Newmont’s Ahafo South Mine has been very impactful across the spectrum of socioeconomic development. The mine’s impact spreads across the local environment (host communities) and the country at large. For instance in 2021 Newmont made a total tax payment of GH¢1.869billion to the state – of which Ahafo South contributed GH¢777million. As the end of June 2022 Newmont Ghana had made a total payment of GH¢1.2billion to the government of Ghana. This covered corporate tax mineral royalty PAYE tax carried interest withholding tax and forestry levy.

Besides the corporate social responsibility arm of the company Newmont Ahafo Development Foundation (NADeF) has also been a major driver of sustainable development across the Ahafo Mine area. The Foundation among others has released about US$34.1million for different projects. In all 127 infrastructural projects were completed and handed over for use as at the end of 2021.

Other good things about mining include the technological and productivity gains which help not only the mining industry but also other sectors. In this case among the biggest and most positive impacts of mining is creation of jobs and the community funding mining companies give to local towns and regions. Newmont’s operational areas [Ahafo and Akyem] are epitomes of that effect: where locals strive for opportunities mining can provide that.

As at the second quarter of 2022 the total number Ghanaian Newmont workers at the Ahafo South and North Mine was 1311 – of which 565 were locals while 746 were drawn from other parts of the country. On the other hand subcontractors of Newmont had 3989 employees and 1803 of them were beneficiaries from host communities while 2186 were recruited from outside the mine;s boundaries.

The Ahafo South mine’s success coupled with its vision to expand operations has set a good foundation for development of the Ahafo North project in the Tano North area of the Ahafo Region. Newmont Africa’s Ahafo mining lease hosts two key deposits which are the Ahafo South Mine and the Ahafo North Project in the Tano North Municipality.

Scope of project

The Ahafo North project is located about 50 kilometres north of the existing south mine. Facts gathered indicate that the project has 3.35 million ounces of reserves and a projected lifespan of 13 years. It is expected to generate about 1800 jobs during the construction phase and 550 direct jobs during operations.

Just like many other businesses construction firms (big and small in the Ahafo North enclave are lacing their boots to explore opportunities that will be created by the pending mining project. The companies are working around the clock to acquire all the needed expertise equipment and certifications to tap into the gold mine.

Movelta Construction Ltd. is a Yamfo-based supply and construction firm that was incorporated in 2013. The company’s General Manager Eliot Adjei Acheampong in an interview said: “We are bracing ourselves to maximise opportunities the Newmont Ahafo North project will generate. I’m aware of the massive construction opportunities including the resettlement development. This will open the floodgates to employ more during such developments. I will appeal to Newmont for help in developing the capacities of local construction firms so that we’ll meet their requirements to secure contracts within their space”.

Sources within Newmont revealed that the company in partnership with international and local companies has started a training programme for construction workers. The target is locals in five host communities where selected candidates will be trained and equipped with employable skills; such as welding scaffolding masonry and carpentry among others.

Development of small-scale enterprises

Many residents have high hopes that the project will stimulate the local economy for exponential growth and development and therefore it is prudent for them join the business fraternity. Many are now venturing into different entrepreneurship activities ranging from micro small and medium-scale enterprises. The people have started profiling potential profitable businesses to determine exactly what type of business is the best choice to invest in. On the other hand existing businesses are also working around the clock to sharpen their skills and expand operations in order to tap into the anticipated economic development in that part of the Ahafo Region.

It is not out of place that Newmont in partnership with the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) has initiated a women’s economic resiliency programme (WERP) for the host communities. The US$420000 initiative seeks to promote the growth and development of women-based dressmaking enterprises through technical and business management trainings. The programme with a well-equipped training centre at Susuanso is expected to create about 300 direct jobs every year for women and young dressmakers in the host communities.

Commenting on the Ahafo North project the chief of Terchire Nana Okoh Agyemang II said: “It is an undeniable fact that the mine cannot employ everybody and therefore the youth must not fold their arms in anticipation of manna falling from heaven once the mine starts operation. Even if you are fortunate enough to be employed by Newmont it will not guarantee that you will become rich overnight.

“The youth in our communities must be measured in their expectations with regard to securing life-changing jobs. It is important that the youth especially those without educational qualifications and employable skills endeavour to add value to themselves by learning technical and vocational skills. This will position them to be relevant in the expected transformation of the local economic environment. Nananom will also continue to negotiate with Newmont to ensure the locals are not given raw deals in terms of recruitment and procurements to boost the local economy.”

On her part Nana Yeboah Pene Managing Director of Ememess Co. Ltd. – a cleaning services firm implored Newmont to help create the enabling environment needed for local businesses to transform. “As the project inches closer to becoming operational many people are going to lose their source of livelihood particularly farmers; and therefore Newmont must prioritise alternative livelihood programmes to absorb those casualties.

“Existing and potential small local businesses must also be supported to grow and develop so as to create more employment opportunities. For instance my company has 18 workers and we are working assiduously to become the preferred choice to secure more contracts in the coming years. This will definitely create more job opportunities.”

Agribusiness development

On the backdrop of the Ahafo North project coming onstream one other economic area that has great potential for growth and development is agribusiness. Traditionally Ahafo North is largely an agrarian area. Hectares of farmlands will be consumed by the mine and obviously the production of food will be reduced against an anticipated increase in demand for food due to the influx of workers and demographical changes.

This makes agribusiness a viable sector for investors. Developments along the agricultural value chain – including supply of inputs processing and distribution of agro products – will be critical to meeting needs of the population. If the opportunity is well-utilised agribusiness will surely become one of the main generators of employment and income.

To this end an agribusiness-based NGO at Adrobaa christened ‘Focus’ has stepped up its activities. The organisation established six (6) years ago is into mechanised production of organic vegetables including cabbage cucumber carrots and lettuce. Currently the NGO has engaged about twenty (20) youth working on its farm.

Mr. Roger Joseph Adusei-Antwi is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Focus. “In anticipation of the local economy’s expansion management of the organisation have resolved to equally expand our production base. We have acquired vast arable lands for commercial production of exotic vegetables and we’ll employ more hands along the value chain. Focus aims to become the leading vegetable producer and supplier in the Ahafo Region and beyond.”

Conclusion

The benefits of mining to the host communities can be more sustainable and impactful if the proportionate share of royalties taxes and other charges borne by mining companies are returned to the local people for judicious use in the form of investment into schools hospitals infrastructure and alternative livelihood activities. With the Ahafo North project in sight it is therefore incumbent on all stakeholders to help make the mine a blessing to the enclave and country as a whole.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy9hLWNvbmdyZXNzbWFuLWp1c3Qtc29sZC1qcG1vcmdhbi1zdG9jay1haGVhZC1vZi1lYXJuaW5ncy1zZWUtdHdvLWRpdmlkZW5kLXN0b2Nrcy1oZS1pcy1hbHNvLXRyYWRpbmctMTAzMTc5NjcwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Congressman Just Sold JPMorgan Stock Ahead Of Earnings: See Two Dividend Stocks He Is Also Trading,"Congressman Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) has served as the U.S. Representative for Oregon's 3rd congressional district since 1996.

The New York Post front page for Thursday Nov. 10th depicts Trump as Humpty Dumpty and says Trump ""sabotaged the midterms"". NY Post

While the control of the United States House and Senate are still in the balance after the 2022 midterm elections one thing is for certain: the 'red wave' Republicans were hoping for did not happen.

Now the New York Post has found who to blame: Donald Trump. The former President of the United States who lost his bid for reelection in 2020 endorsed over 300 Republican candidates across the country and the result has not been what Republicans have hoped for.

Donald Trump hints he will run for president in 2024

In an editorial piece called ""Toxic Trump"" the right-leaning publication owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has not only greenlit a scathing editorial piece on the 45th President of the U.S. but also allowed it to grace its front cover.

The John Fetterman Senate victory in Pennsylvania over Trump-endorsed Mehmet Oz has stung the GOP in particular and writer John Podhoretz minces no words in attacking the former President: ""What Tuesday night's results suggest is that Trump is perhaps the most profound vote repellant in modern American history.""

Podhoretz continues by saying that with the exception of states where ""a Republican corpse would have won"" an endorsement by Trump meant failure.

A big development: the Murdochs control Fox News

The fact that the New York Post is displaying this story on its front cover likely means a big change of direction in conservative media in the U.S. which has religiously backed Donald Trump ever since winning the GOP nomination in 2016.

News Corp also controls Fox News the most influential right-leaning news network and this ""Humpty Dumpty"" cover story is a strong indicator that criticism of Trump will not only be allowed but also promoted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY28udWsvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvYS1nbGltcHNlLWludG8tbmV3cy11ay10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A GLIMPSE INTO NEWS UK TECHNOLOGY,"An Interview with Liwen Knight-Zhang

Liwen Knight-Zhang Head of Product Platforms News UK

Liwen Knight-Zhang is Head of Product Platforms at News UK Technology based in London Bridge right next door to the iconic Shard building in South London. Since managing to move a picture of Mario from left to right on his Commando 64 Liwen has never lost the satisfaction of programming. Liwen moved to the UK 18 years ago and completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science at Durham University and has worked in the industry for over 15 years. Nowadays although not fully hands-on at work he still finds spare time to tinker with his Emacs setup with a bit of lisp code alongside his Executive MBA study at Imperial College London.

Your career trajectory at News UK Tech looks very intriguing! You started as a Principal Engineer moved to a Head of Engineering role and now you’ve taken on the Head of Product Platforms which is business focused. Tell us more about your experience and why the transition?

To be 100% honest I didn’t expect such career growth from working with any company. From my role changes you can probably tell that I really have grown a lot in the last three years. If you look at the News UK technology department as a whole you’ll see I am not an isolated case. News UK is a great place to work learn grow and make a difference. There has never been a shortage of career opportunities — at least in my time at News UK. These opportunities plus the growth mindset culture has really pushed me to move forward.

I love building teams. Engineering is what I love to do and I am really good at it. I have also been gifted with the ability to manage and build successful teams. I am fascinated with the business side of things: organisational behaviour culture industry trends finance diversity inclusion social responsibility and such like. Basically I am curious about everything that I don’t know! Also I am not one to allow a great opportunity to pass me by so when the Head of Product Platforms role came up right after being accepted onto an Executive MBA programme of course I grabbed it with both hands.

What excites you working at News UK Tech?

Where do I start? I get this question fairly often when I interview engineers. My answer always starts with the technologies and the people. News UK Tech is surprisingly forward thinking (I don’t know why I said ‘surprisingly’!). The tech stacks are very current and the engineering practices are exciting. Yes we do have legacy systems like every other organisation but we constantly learn improve and evolve our estate. The fact that we challenge ourselves all the time in making the right technical decisions autonomously (with the right support of course) is something I’ve only truly experienced at News UK.

Being able to work in a great diverse team with a shared vision that unites everyone is an amazing feeling and it’s what gets me out of bed every day.

Were there any challenges?

Never having enough time! Actually over the years I had quite a number of challenges but nothing insurmountable. Initially it was hard to build truly geo-dispersed teams. There were time differences culture barriers and annoying technological challenges! For example when doing an all-team workshop it was almost impossible to get everyone to participate equally when we have half the team members onsite and half are remote. It took us quite a while to learn the best ways to work with each other and adopt new ways of working. An added benefit was that when Covid hit we suddenly realised what we were trying to do all made sense in a world where remote working is the norm.

Also the talent market is very tough. We probably have all heard about the ‘Great Resignation’. Luckily my team is very stable and we have only seen natural turnover — a testament of our team culture. We have had some excellent candidate referrals from our colleagues who like working for News UK tech.

The other thing worth mentioning is that we have a complex business setup but — given the size of our estate it comes as no surprise. This brings its own challenges for sure but then again it presents a lot of learning opportunities you only get when working with big organisations. I do enjoy some good challenges once in a while!

I noticed that you have done quite a few interviews and talks recently. I know you are speaking at a conference next month how do you fit all this in your schedule?

By squeezing hard! Honestly it’s not easy but I do enjoy it. I have a couple of people in my team to thank for this. They’ve inspired me to do more personal brand building share knowledge and experience with others and be involved in the community. One of my past colleagues is very well known in the QA community she speaks in conferences writes blog posts and records lectures. Two of my current Principal Engineers have books published! I wish I was more like them.

Any advice for young technologists who want to grow their career?

The first thing I’d say is be curious — it is like a super power. Keep learning keep trying new things be inquisitive and always strive for better. When curiosity becomes part of you you don’t need any willpower or discipline anymore you’ll find joy in doing all the seemingly hard work.

Another thing is to have an idea of where you want to be in 5 years time but also try to enjoy the journey as much as you can. You’ll find there is hardly a straight path to anything in life — including career development. I have seen a lot of young people get obsessed with getting to the ‘next level’ fast but forget to give their best to the things they do every day.

Lastly don’t forget to pick up a hobby or two find like minded people and have fun!

The Forecast provides insight into the millions of Australians who connect with the company’s food brands revealing the shifts and trends that will have the largest influence on consumer food behaviours and the strategic opportunities these present for brands.

Managing director food and travel Fiona Nilsson said: “This is the sixth year of our Forecast and the trends identified in the 2023 special report show it is more relevant than ever presenting opportunities for brands to align their content marketing strategies with what’s driving consumer behaviour around food.

“We have focused on the seismic shifts of Covid-19 and the rising cost of living and the impacts these are having and will continue to have on Australian food habits along with the key trends and seasonal insights we’re seeing for the year ahead. These are the things marketers need to know to connect with their consumers that we believe will be driving the biggest actions in 2023.”

Looking at the year ahead the virtual presentation featured Nilsson and News Corp Australia thought leadership and food industry experts including Leigh Lavery head of growth intelligence client and commercial; Laura Simpson digital director of mass food; Brodee Myers-Cooke editorial director of mass food; and Kerrie McCallum editorial director – premium food & travel.

Cost of living impacts over the next twelve months is expected to be the major factor shaping consumers’ lives particularly in what they eat what they cook and how they entertain.

The report found that 75 per cent of consumers are experiencing greater cost of living pressures compared to last year and 70 per cent expect that the pressure will continue to become greater in the next year. Groceries are the number one noticeable price increase impacting households currently ranking ahead of fuel bills rent and mortgages entertainment and eating out.

Covid has impacted Australians and how they engage with food in several meaningful ways and these trends will continue through to 2023 and beyond. Eating at home has increased by 38 per cent and for convenience 2.2 million more people are now often choosing frozen or chilled ready prepared meals.

Eating for health such as vegetarian meals and buying organic or minimally processed foods have all increased since Covid however 73 per cent like to eat healthily but do not want to compromise on taste.

The New York Post front page for Thursday Nov. 10th depicts Trump as Humpty Dumpty and says Trump ""sabotaged the midterms"". NY Post

While the control of the United States House and Senate are still in the balance after the 2022 midterm elections one thing is for certain: the 'red wave' Republicans were hoping for did not happen.

Now the New York Post has found who to blame: Donald Trump. The former President of the United States who lost his bid for reelection in 2020 endorsed over 300 Republican candidates across the country and the result has not been what Republicans have hoped for.

Donald Trump hints he will run for president in 2024

In an editorial piece called ""Toxic Trump"" the right-leaning publication owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has not only greenlit a scathing editorial piece on the 45th President of the U.S. but also allowed it to grace its front cover.

The John Fetterman Senate victory in Pennsylvania over Trump-endorsed Mehmet Oz has stung the GOP in particular and writer John Podhoretz minces no words in attacking the former President: ""What Tuesday night's results suggest is that Trump is perhaps the most profound vote repellant in modern American history.""

Podhoretz continues by saying that with the exception of states where ""a Republican corpse would have won"" an endorsement by Trump meant failure.

A big development: the Murdochs control Fox News

The fact that the New York Post is displaying this story on its front cover likely means a big change of direction in conservative media in the U.S. which has religiously backed Donald Trump ever since winning the GOP nomination in 2016.

News Corp also controls Fox News the most influential right-leaning news network and this ""Humpty Dumpty"" cover story is a strong indicator that criticism of Trump will not only be allowed but also promoted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY28udWsvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvYS1nbGltcHNlLWludG8tbmV3cy11ay10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A GLIMPSE INTO NEWS UK TECHNOLOGY,"An Interview with Liwen Knight-Zhang

Liwen Knight-Zhang Head of Product Platforms News UK

Liwen Knight-Zhang is Head of Product Platforms at News UK Technology based in London Bridge right next door to the iconic Shard building in South London. Since managing to move a picture of Mario from left to right on his Commando 64 Liwen has never lost the satisfaction of programming. Liwen moved to the UK 18 years ago and completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science at Durham University and has worked in the industry for over 15 years. Nowadays although not fully hands-on at work he still finds spare time to tinker with his Emacs setup with a bit of lisp code alongside his Executive MBA study at Imperial College London.

Your career trajectory at News UK Tech looks very intriguing! You started as a Principal Engineer moved to a Head of Engineering role and now you’ve taken on the Head of Product Platforms which is business focused. Tell us more about your experience and why the transition?

To be 100% honest I didn’t expect such career growth from working with any company. From my role changes you can probably tell that I really have grown a lot in the last three years. If you look at the News UK technology department as a whole you’ll see I am not an isolated case. News UK is a great place to work learn grow and make a difference. There has never been a shortage of career opportunities — at least in my time at News UK. These opportunities plus the growth mindset culture has really pushed me to move forward.

I love building teams. Engineering is what I love to do and I am really good at it. I have also been gifted with the ability to manage and build successful teams. I am fascinated with the business side of things: organisational behaviour culture industry trends finance diversity inclusion social responsibility and such like. Basically I am curious about everything that I don’t know! Also I am not one to allow a great opportunity to pass me by so when the Head of Product Platforms role came up right after being accepted onto an Executive MBA programme of course I grabbed it with both hands.

What excites you working at News UK Tech?

Where do I start? I get this question fairly often when I interview engineers. My answer always starts with the technologies and the people. News UK Tech is surprisingly forward thinking (I don’t know why I said ‘surprisingly’!). The tech stacks are very current and the engineering practices are exciting. Yes we do have legacy systems like every other organisation but we constantly learn improve and evolve our estate. The fact that we challenge ourselves all the time in making the right technical decisions autonomously (with the right support of course) is something I’ve only truly experienced at News UK.

Being able to work in a great diverse team with a shared vision that unites everyone is an amazing feeling and it’s what gets me out of bed every day.

Were there any challenges?

Never having enough time! Actually over the years I had quite a number of challenges but nothing insurmountable. Initially it was hard to build truly geo-dispersed teams. There were time differences culture barriers and annoying technological challenges! For example when doing an all-team workshop it was almost impossible to get everyone to participate equally when we have half the team members onsite and half are remote. It took us quite a while to learn the best ways to work with each other and adopt new ways of working. An added benefit was that when Covid hit we suddenly realised what we were trying to do all made sense in a world where remote working is the norm.

Also the talent market is very tough. We probably have all heard about the ‘Great Resignation’. Luckily my team is very stable and we have only seen natural turnover — a testament of our team culture. We have had some excellent candidate referrals from our colleagues who like working for News UK tech.

The other thing worth mentioning is that we have a complex business setup but — given the size of our estate it comes as no surprise. This brings its own challenges for sure but then again it presents a lot of learning opportunities you only get when working with big organisations. I do enjoy some good challenges once in a while!

I noticed that you have done quite a few interviews and talks recently. I know you are speaking at a conference next month how do you fit all this in your schedule?

By squeezing hard! Honestly it’s not easy but I do enjoy it. I have a couple of people in my team to thank for this. They’ve inspired me to do more personal brand building share knowledge and experience with others and be involved in the community. One of my past colleagues is very well known in the QA community she speaks in conferences writes blog posts and records lectures. Two of my current Principal Engineers have books published! I wish I was more like them.

Any advice for young technologists who want to grow their career?

The first thing I’d say is be curious — it is like a super power. Keep learning keep trying new things be inquisitive and always strive for better. When curiosity becomes part of you you don’t need any willpower or discipline anymore you’ll find joy in doing all the seemingly hard work.

Another thing is to have an idea of where you want to be in 5 years time but also try to enjoy the journey as much as you can. You’ll find there is hardly a straight path to anything in life — including career development. I have seen a lot of young people get obsessed with getting to the ‘next level’ fast but forget to give their best to the things they do every day.

Lastly don’t forget to pick up a hobby or two find like minded people and have fun!

Electrolyzer production will get 89000 square feet of dedicated space at an existing Cummins facility in Fridley Minnesota. Production will start at 500 megawatts of manufacturing capacity annually which could grow to 1 gigawatt. Cummins did not disclose how much it is investing in the Twin Cities area or when production would begin.

Hydrogen electrolyzers opposite of fuel cells

An electrolyzer separates water into oxygen and hydrogen effectively the opposite of a fuel cell which uses water and electricity to separate hydrogen and oxygen creating water vapor as the only emission. In an electrolyzer water is pushed through a stack with electricity. That pulls the hydrogen molecules apart from the oxygen molecules.

When an electrolyzer system uses renewable electricity — such as from solar wind or hydropower — it produces carbon-free green hydrogen storable as a compressed gas or as a liquid. Energy-dense green hydrogen is critical to moving long-haul trucks off diesel fuel. It is also useful in reducing the carbon footprint of other industries.

Speaking to The Drum about the FutureBrand Index 2022 which revealed the world’s most valuable brands list is dominated by energy and technology companies Curtis says the clear purpose of these brands will see them become household names in the coming years.

“It's difficult to avoid the discussion in the media around purpose” says Curtis. “If we're talking about toothpaste or dishwasher tablets it can be very hard to reflect on what that purpose might be. But if we're talking about new technologies infrastructure renewable energy and so on I think there's a much clearer and much stronger case for those organisations having a clearer sense of purpose and being able to deliver on that.”

“What we know about purpose is that it's redundant or at least invisible if it doesn't show up in the experience. What we're seeing year on year is that those brands that are able to strengthen the connection between the brand's purpose and the everyday experience perform particularly well.

“B2B brands have the opportunity to have that clear sense of purpose and then deliver it through meaningful experiences that matter to people.”

Curtis says this is reflected in the dominance of B2B infrastructure and technology brands on the FutureBrand Index 2022. The list which ranks the world’s most valuable brands by perception was led by renewable energy company NextEra Energy followed by Reliance Industries CATL and Tata Consultancy Services – all of which have strong portfolios in green energy electric vehicle batteries and renewables.

While these companies are currently not largely recognisable to consumers it is only a matter of time.

“Our modern consumer economy was kind of born out of the 1960s when the promise of the future was refrigeration in every home air conditioners and that kind of Jetson-like promise of the future. And that was the age that gave birth to the brands that evolved into the powerhouses like Unilever and P&G and others.

“We're seeing now that those B2B brands are equally invested in our future. While the future in the 1960s was modern consumerisation now in the 2020s it is the technology and the infrastructure we can rely on to live and work. Hence you're seeing businesses like NextEra thrive.

“They will become household names as people become much more familiar with the brands providing that infrastructure and those platforms on which we all depend.”

The brand experience is much more important to a consumer than its identity says Curtis as brands are defined by what they do rather than say.

“We have seen a shift towards brand as an experience and it’s much more about how you deliver an experience through which people can interact with your brand. It makes for a more succinct definition: a brand is what a brand does.”

“There was a time when brand and marketing were all about identity. Brands needed a clear sense of identity and differentiation. Hence brands had to develop their personality tone of voice and a greater sense of identity because they needed to stand out and be recognisable and distinct from their competitors.

“I think where we’ve evolved now is beyond this idea as brand as identity to brand as utility. So it’s less about ‘how do I identify a brand’ and more about ‘how do I use this brand to live a healthy lifestyle or access convenient products and services that make my life simpler in some way’"" says Curtis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2FuYWRpYW5idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vaWRlYXMvaHlkcm8tcXVlYmVjLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLXBvd2VyLXN0cnVnZ2xlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Hydro-Québec's Billion-Dollar Power Struggle,"In 2015 Massachusetts’ newly elected Republican governor Charlie Baker flew to St. John’s for his first-ever New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers summit an annual gathering focused on the joint challenges facing New England Atlantic Canada and Quebec. One of the big topics of discussion that year was climate: how these 11 provinces and states would work together to drive down their greenhouse-gas emissions. For Baker that meant one thing above all: tapping into Quebec’s huge surplus of hydroelectric power to decarbonize his state’s energy grid which is heavily dependent on polluting expensive natural gas. “They have capacity” he said in St. John’s. “We have demand.”

It’s not every day that a Republican governor makes a push for a transformative clean-energy proposal but Baker—a defender of abortion rights Obamacare and the Paris Agreement—isn’t a typical Republican. (He didn’t vote for Donald Trump.)

By 2017 Trump was using his executive powers to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Act as Baker was doubling down on his energy intentions. Massachusetts put an ambitious renewable-energy initiative out to tender. The state’s mandate was clear: All of its energy-distribution companies would have to enter long-term contracts to procure sustainable energy from wind solar or hydro.

Massachusetts received 46 proposals in response to its RFP and indeed six came from Hydro-Québec the Montreal-based public utility with a long history of making enterprising energy deals. Among the six was New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) a proposal to build 832 transmission towers that would carry 233 kilometres’ worth of high-voltage line from the Quebec border to a converter station in Lewiston Maine—which in turn would deliver 1200 megawatts of power to Massachusetts and billions of dollars to Hydro-Québec’s coffers.

Submitted in partnership with Connecticut-based energy company Avangrid the plan would reduce Massachusetts’ greenhouse-gas emissions by 3 million tonnes annually—the equivalent of 700000 cars’ worth of pollution. Some Massachusetts taxpayers grumbled at having to fund the entire US$950 million construction. But that was nothing compared to the major source of controversy around the project: the high-voltage transmission corridor would have to cut through wetlands and forests in Maine.

Hydro-Québec’s high-voltage power lines snake through James Bay

Since 2018 NECEC has been dogged by fierce opposition from an unlikely—and ideologically fragmented—coalition of incumbent fossil-fuel interest groups and fossil-fuel environmental groups in Maine. The former brought money to the fight; the latter waged war on ethical and ecological grounds. Both positioned Hydro-Québec as the foreign bogeyman: a state-owned monopoly bent on mowing down forests in pursuit of profit.

“Hydro-Québec is just full of shit” says Nick Bennett staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine a conservation group that stridently opposes NECEC. For starters he doubts that the plan will reduce the emissions outlined in its projections. “These people have lied to an unbelievable degree.” (Hydro-Québec begs to differ.)

In January 2021 after three years of consultations town hall meetings and environmental analysis the project cleared its final approvals and began construction. Ten months later the sheer volume of opposition convinced legislators in Maine to hold a referendum on whether NECEC should in fact proceed—even though construction was already far along and money invested. One-third of Maine voters came out to the polls and the vote came in at 59 per cent opposed. Avangrid immediately challenged the referendum’s legality saying that retroactively banning an approved project violated both state and federal law. After that the final decision was punted to the Maine supreme court.

“‘Frustrating’ doesn’t even begin to describe how this feels” says Serge Abergel the 49-year-old chief operating officer of Hydro-Québec’s U.S. operations. “It has been an enormous weight on the shoulders of all the people who’ve worked on this for years and years.”

The stakes are high—not just for Massachusetts but for Quebec and potentially the entire region. Hydro-Québec had been exporting power to New England since the 1980s. NECEC is not only a multi-billion-dollar export project but also the key to a long-term play by Hydro-Québec to become an indispensable force on the power grid.

“It has been an enormous weight on the shoulders of all the people who’ve worked on this for years and years”

But there are many opponents: Fossil-fuel companies are fighting off a threat to the bottom line. Canadian Indigenous communities for their part are taking this moment to draw attention to historical injustices. To them NECEC is another example of Hydro-Québec profiting from the historical exploitation and destruction of their traditional lands upon which many of today’s hydroelectric facilities are built. For environmental groups in Maine it matters more that NECEC is disrupting a delicate landscape and less that it is a clean-energy project. The irony here is evident. Building green will always have an impact. The key point that NECEC illustrates is this: What trade-offs and collateral damage are we willing to take on to decarbonize our energy system and attempt to stave off a climate catastrophe?

For many climate advocates the pitched battle over a few hundred kilometres of high-voltage line has therefore become a litmus test prompting bigger questions: What’s the cost of a clean-energy grid? And how ready are we to put into motion an energy transition that is becoming more urgent with every passing year?

“Can I share my pain with you?” asks Serge Abergel over the phone from his soon-to-be-empty Montreal home.

Abergel took over the job as Hydro-Québec lead in the States last December. He is now in the words of Hydro-Québec CEO Sophie Brochu “patrolling the waters” stateside drumming up support for—and dousing opposition toward—the company’s ambitions in New England. So he’s house-hunting there. Ideally his new home base will be central to Montreal Boston and New York but close as well to the pastoral New England settings where Hydro-Québec’s plans have been most bitterly contested. It hasn’t been easy.

“You see a house in the morning and in the afternoon the agent tells you the owners are expecting offers by tomorrow noon” he says. “Like it or not you’re a foreigner a Canadian. You have no clue what this market is.”

Abergel may as well be talking about Hydro-Québec’s reception in Maine where its status as one of the world’s largest hydroelectricity systems—and a state-owned monopoly—has given rise to a David and Goliath narrative.

Not that there isn’t something of Goliath in the company. Over the past 80 years it has built on vast swaths of Quebec harnessing the power of hundreds of wild rivers with 681 weirs and dams 61 generating stations 260000 kilometres of transmission line and 28 hydro reservoirs—“inland seas” in Hydro-Québec’s words. The largest Caniapiscau Reservoir is Quebec’s biggest body of water covering more than 4300 square kilometres.

It’s impossible to separate Hydro-Québec’s impact from Quebec’s modern history. In 1962 Liberal leader Jean Lesage campaigned on a promise to bring Quebec’s few remaining private utilities under Hydro-Québec’s control fully nationalizing an energy sector previously dominated by Anglo and American concerns. “Masters in our own house” was Lesage’s slogan. Hydro-Québec became a symbol of Quebec’s Quiet Revolution—and a cash cow for the province with the majority of its profits including a record $3.5 billion in 2021 redistributed to the Quebec government its only shareholder.

In 2015 Hydro-Québec appointed veteran Bombardier executive Eric Martel as its CEO. Martel articulated a new vision for the utility to become “the battery of the northeast” a defining force uniting the balkanized electrical systems of Quebec Ontario Atlantic Canada New England and New York—and their roughly 60 million residents. Here’s how it would work: By building more transmission lines to the northeast grid Quebec would export power but also import it when renewable generation is high in New England. Hydro-Québec would then fill its reservoirs rather than using that water to generate power. And when the opposite conditions occurred—when the wind wasn’t blowing or the sun shining and New England states weren’t producing enough clean energy—reservoirs would be drained to generate power for export.

In 2020 Martel left Hydro-Québec to return to Bombardier as president and CEO and he passed the baton to Sophie Brochu who had previously spent 12 years as CEO of natural-gas distributor Énergir (formerly Gaz Métro). She ran with it. Brochu has long focused on the urgency of the transition to green power. Jean-Benoit Nadeau a journalist who has written extensively about the energy sector profiled Brochu for L’actualite in 2017. That story positioned her as a corporate leader with an unusually strong ethical sensibility. “Brochu explains that her job is to ‘optimize’ performance—financial social environmental—rather than to maximize profit” wrote Nadeau.

Brochu’s social conscience appears genuine but it is also clear that she’s selling something. “People grasp the fires in California. People grasp the fires out west. People get the need” she says. “But we collectively have to be way more curious about what will be required to make the energy transition happen. Human beings don’t like to hear this because it means ‘What will be necessary for me? What will I need to change?’”

For Brochu the answer is building more transmission capacity enabling more energy-swapping with other jurisdictions and facilitating the most efficient allocation of clean energy. And before any of that can happen states and provinces need to stop being territorial entities—“parochial autonomous little systems” as Brochu calls them.

The problem of course is that you can’t run power into Massachusetts without going through another state. The first attempt to bring Hydro- Québec’s electricity to Massachusetts was called Northern Pass a proposed line through New Hampshire. It was rejected in 2018 by state regulators due to concerns about impacts on the state’s White Mountain National Forest. NECEC was the second choice and again Hydro-Québec was ready for a fight having long faced opposition to new infrastructure. In 2004 the activist group Résistance Internationaliste claimed responsibility for bombing a Quebec hydro tower protesting the “pillaging” of natural resources by the U.S.

Bombings aside these experiences usually had diplomatic and productive outcomes. And according to Abergel they instilled in Hydro-Québec’s corporate brass the idea that honest conversation about benefits and drawbacks could win hearts and minds. He sounds like he really believes it—or did. “Nothing” Abergel says now “prepared us for Maine.”

Among the earliest opponents of NECEC was Sandi Howard an eighth-generation Mainer who works as a whitewater guide in The Forks region—right near the intersection of the Dead and Kennebec rivers where NECEC would pass. In July 2018 she attended one of the first consultations at The Forks Town Hall packed with business owners river guides and outdoors enthusiasts most of whom she knew. “It’s a very small community here” she says.

After that first meeting during which Howard says the project was pitched as a done deal she began a Facebook group called “Say No to NECEC.” It now has more than 11000 followers and has become a clearinghouse for opposition.

The foremost concern was location. Most of the corridor was to be built alongside an existing line but an 85-kilometre section would be newly constructed through Maine’s North Woods. Howard and others were worried about tourism and recreation—fishing hiking rafting—as well as the ecological impacts of cutting a 300-foot-wide path through intact forest.

Clearly there would be impacts. An environmental assessment by the U.S. Department of Energy declared the affected area part of “one of the world’s last remaining contiguous temperate broadleaf-mixed forests” supporting “exceptional biodiversity.” The question facing regulators boiled down to one premise: Does the project’s benefits outweigh its harms? The Department of Energy’s assessment and another by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concluded that the answer was yes. The former pointed to measures suggested by Avangrid to mitigate harms such as taller-than-usual towers placed farther apart to minimize disruption at ground level.

But there still would be consequences particularly habitat fragmentation with that large contiguous forest being sundered in two. Serge Abergel’s position essentially is that we don’t have time to craft ideal impact-free solutions: “Anybody that promises to build large-scale infrastructure today without issues is either very naive or lying.”

Inside a construction office: Aerial maps plot out the NECEC line

The argument may be self-serving but it’s not necessarily false. New transmission corridors must traverse continents cutting through untrammelled wilderness. Solar and wind farms require vast tracts of land. Electric vehicles require the destructive extraction of metals and minerals. When it comes to NECEC there are those who doubt that all the construction will amount to much upside. “We quickly determined that NECEC had no evidence of any climate-change benefits at all” says Nick Bennett of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “This is just a shell game by Hydro-Québec.”

Bennett and others have argued that Hydro-Québec does not have adequate surplus power to serve both Quebecers and the new contract without reducing spot-market sales in other jurisdictions such as Ontario. The result they say is that those markets would be forced to compensate with fossil fuels. This “resource shuffling” argument has been a cornerstone of advocacy against NECEC and Northern Pass as well as Champlain Hudson Power Express—Hydro-Québec’s other big U.S. export project which is intended to deliver 1250 megawatts of power to New York City. Anti-NECEC advocates cite the basis of the argument as unvarnished fact whereas most energy-market analysts and climate researchers view it dubiously.

Ultimately the fact that the project has become so bogged down illustrates how difficult the transition to clean energy will be. Emil Dimanchev a climate-policy scholar at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and research affiliate at MIT says that the controversy around NECEC “bodes poorly for our ability to meet our climate goals in the U.S. or Canada. We need to get good at building things again and this is showing that we as a society are not good at building things.”

Dimanchev stresses that for the project to achieve its maximum potential climate benefits it needs to be adaptable to a two-way system. That’s the driving idea behind his 2020 paper “Two Way Trade in Green Electrons” which Hydro-Québec cites in its own PR materials. In that study Dimanchev and colleagues investigated different models of how Canadian hydro would best be used to green the American grid. Their results were consistent with the so-called “battery” notion: Climate goals are achieved at the lowest cost if Quebec is not only an exporter but also an importer of energy with the flow switching back and forth on the transmission lines.

This exact model is often touted by Hydro-Québec as a rationale for building more transmission but NECEC is currently a one-way project which frustrates Pierre-Olivier Pineau the Energy Sector Management chair at HEC Montréal the graduate business school at the Université de Montréal. He supports NECEC but also says it’s a piecemeal approach.

“Anybody that promises to build large-scale infrastructure today without issues is either very naive or lying”

“There is no credible future in which we will regret having built the transmission line to Massachusetts” says Pineau. “Even if it is one-way now it can become a two-way line easily. So I see it as a good starting project. At the same time when I talk to Hydro-Québec they just say ‘We want to be the battery of the northeast.’ So how do you make that happen?”

A final refrain among opponents is that Hydro-Québec’s power is not in fact nearly as clean as advertised. This point is tricky to pin down. Hydro reservoirs—those inland seas that Hydro-Québec is so proud of building—emit large volumes of greenhouse gases especially in years immediately following flooding as vegetation and other biomass trapped beneath the water decompose. Researchers calculate hydro energy’s impact on climate by estimating CO2-equivalent emissions such as those from methane over a hypothetical 100-year reservoir lifespan. By that measure Hydro-Québec estimates that its entire power system has a carbon footprint of 32 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour—far below say coal at over 1000 and comparable to solar which is typically between five and 50 grams.

There’s intense disagreement on the numbers. In testimony to the Army Corps of Engineers in 2019 Bradford Hager a professor in the department of earth atmospheric and planetary sciences at MIT and a prominent voice in this debate cited the work of Swiss researchers Stephan Pfister and Laura Scherer in estimating lifetime emissions for the world’s 1473 hydroelectric plants. Published in 2016 the research showed that Hydro-Québec’s facilities’ impact ranged from 42 to 605 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour. The exception was its Brisay generating station on the Caniapiscau Reservoir in James Bay which came in at a staggering 2250 grams. This was enough in Hagar’s estimation to call Hydro-Québec “among the dirtiest hydro in the world.”

Sandi Howard leader of the “Say No to NECEC” group speaks to reporters as protestors rally outside the State House in Augusta on Friday March 15 2019 (photo: Kevin Miller/Portland Press Herald)

But according to lead researcher Pfister this is a flawed conclusion. “Building hydro power will basically cause five years of damage” he says. “The longer you run it the lower the impact of kilowatt hours.” Because the vast majority of greenhouse gases are released immediately following a reservoir’s impoundment average lifetime emissions are dramatically weighted to its first few years. In Iother words Hydro-Québec’s reservoirs don’t have a high carbon footprint today—they used to. This may call into question the wisdom of building new reservoirs but it also means that refusing to make use of the power they produce today would be environmentally nonsensical.

“I question where the opponents come from with their claims” says Abergel. “And I think a lot of them unfortunately are likely to be paid actors in this. There is genuine opposition but there is opposition that’s professional as well.” This is a not-so-veiled reference to the incumbent oil-and-gas companies that have provided the lion’s share of the money to opponents of NECEC. Those companies find themselves in an unusual alliance with non-profit environmental organizations and back-to-the-land New Englanders.

Sandi Howard acknowledges the bedfellows. After six months of grassroots organizing largely through her own personal networks Howard allied with environmental networks: Natural Resources Council of Maine Sierra Club Maine Appalachian Mountain Club Trout Unlimited and Environment Maine. A few months after that she found she had better-funded allies: incumbent fossil-fuel producers including two Texas-based fossil-fuel companies Calpine and Vistra and Florida-based NextEra Energy whose New England operations largely consist of oil and gas plants. Howard says it was necessary to ally with well-funded backers to take on a powerful entity like Hydro-Québec. “Unfortunately private citizens just don’t have the deep pockets that multinational corporations do” she says.

The growing anti-NECEC coalition began working in 2020 to organize the referendum that put the fate of the project directly in the hands of Mainers. An initial effort in 2020 was rejected by a judge—but a second attempt landed the question on a ballot last November. For months both sides mounted a PR campaign spending tens of millions of dollars. “I began to dream about it at night literally” says Abergel.

The opposition side included Mainers for Local Power a group funded by Calpine and Vistra which spent nearly US$26 million. Another group Stop the Corridor is an alleged dark-money organization that has not disclosed its donors. But it too ran radio and TV ads featuring folksy small-town Mainers fretting that the project will degrade Maine’s “environment and outdoor heritage…all to send power to Massachusetts” complete with photo collages of earth-moving equipment tearing apart pristine wilderness.

Construction involves widening the existing power corridor

Proponents spent even more—US$70 million including US$22 million by Hydro-Québec—on similarly over-the-top marketing. (An Avangrid-backed letter campaign aimed at rural Mainers suggested that allowing referendums to retroactively amend laws might result in revoking constitutionally enshrined gun rights.)

There was one more wedge used by opponents to paint Canadian hydro as unsavoury however and it was much harder to ignore than spuriously interpreted data about dirty hydro. In 2020 five Indigenous communities in Canada banded together to publicly oppose Hydro-Québec’s export efforts. If the history of Hydro-Québec’s ambitions mirrors the history of the province itself so too does it mirror the darkness of that history. Many of Hydro-Québec’s reservoirs and other projects were built on traditional Indigenous land. Some of those communities are now using the furor over NECEC to draw greater attention to those past injustices—a strategy that has won sympathetic ears in New England.

The most dramatic example is the behemoth Smallwood Reservoir which is not actually in Quebec but just over the border in Labrador. Created in the early 1970s it’s the second-largest hydro reservoir on earth containing 33 cubic kilometres of water held back by 88 dikes. It feeds the nearby Churchill Falls Generating Station a joint project between Hydro-Québec and Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited a Newfoundland-based Crown corporation established to build the facility. Since 1974 nearly all the electricity generated at Churchill Falls has been sold to Hydro-Québec.

“This was devastating and it completely changed their way of life overnight”

Before it was flooded the 6500-square-kilometre area of land—larger than Prince Edward Island—covered by the Smallwood Reservoir was a dense patchwork of spruce forests small lakes and wild rivers. It was inhabited primarily by the Innu Nation of Labrador for whom it was an integral part of a traditional way of life used for travel hunting and sustenance. The Innu Nation has thousands of years of history here—after the reservoir was flooded in 1974 the bones of interred Innu washed up on the reservoir’s shores for years.

“There was no consultation and in many cases not even notification that this land which the Innu had and continue to have title to would be flooded” says Matt McPherson a lawyer with Toronto firm Olthuis Kleer Townshend LLP which is representing the Innu in a $4-billion lawsuit against Hydro-Québec. “This was devastating and it completely changed their way of life overnight. In many cases Innu people only learned about it when the water started rising.”

Similar issues have played out in Quebec. “We have many kilometres of hydro lines crossing unceded ancestral territories and our sovereignty over the land is still effective to this day” says Lucien Wabanonik councillor with the Lac Simon band council in western Quebec and member of the Anishinabeg Nation.

When Sophie Brochu joined Hydro-Québec in 2020 she pledged to make outreach to Indigenous communities a foremost concern. “I came to Hydro-Québec with no knowledge of Indigenous reality” she says. “I’m 59. I was raised by people who didn’t know what they were talking about—the history the relations.” She says she wants to ensure that younger Quebecers get a well-rounded sense of the history of Hydro-Québec because the older generation still clings to its mythic role in the Quiet Revolution narrative. “My dream is that each kid could go up and visit James Bay and take the time to sit down with the Indigenous communities and understand their reality” says Brochu.

Wabanonik says that those pledges have not yet amounted to much and he doesn’t see the issue as being especially complicated. He also says that claiming ignorance of the history doesn’t wash. “I don’t understand why a person like that with that type of education is saying ‘I wasn’t aware’” he says. “To me that’s an excuse.”

After the referendum in Maine last November the work on building NECEC ceased and its construction licence was suspended. In December Avangrid appealed the decision to Maine’s Supreme Judicial Court. On August 29 of this year the court issued its ruling siding with Hydro-Québec and Avangrid—sort of. It declared the retroactive ban to the project illegal—subject to proof that construction was sufficiently far along before the referendum. It now falls to the Maine Business and Consumer Court to decide if the work that has been completed between the project’s approval in January 2021 and the November 2021’s referendum is “significant visible construction and in good faith.” That seems like a shoo-in. NECEC has already spent US$450 million cleared most of the corridor and built 120 towers. All the same opponents have vowed to not stop fighting.

Even if that decision is ultimately favourable to NECEC other obstacles remain. Opponents also took the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands to court arguing that the bureau didn’t follow proper procedures when leasing land to Avangrid for its corridor. In August 2021 a Maine judge agreed and vacated a lease to one mile of public land. That isn’t necessarily a death blow for the project but it will add more time complexity and cost to the approval process.

Opponents from Sandi Howard and the Natural Resources Council of Maine to NextEra have also mounted appeals against NECEC’s environmental approvals and are aiming to consolidate those appeals into one. “The public should have an opportunity to have self-determination on how we’re going to meet our climate goals” says Howard. “Jumping at the first project is not always the way that it’s going to go. It’s a very complex problem.”

Serge Abergel counters that this is merely an excuse for inaction. “NIMBYism is looking at the tree and saying ‘My tree in Maine you’re never touching it. That’s how I protect the environment’” he says. “And that’s how we’re doomed to fail. Any transition will be costly. You’re doing open-heart surgery here. It’s going to hurt. There’s no space for NIMBYism here.”

Protestors position Hydro-Québec as a ruthless foreigner

Ultimately the goal of naysayers is to either kill the project or delay it indefinitely. And it’s this that makes the NECEC battle emblematic of the challenges of green energy. In a widely publicized 2021 study Princeton University researchers detailed just how much had yet to be done on the energy transition concluding that technology and infrastructure must be deployed faster and at a larger scale than ever before. Given that renewable energy tends to have a larger footprint on land area than fossil fuels vast wind and solar farms and thousands of kilometres of transmission line must be built in rural areas. Doing this requires faster approvals than the traditional environmental analyses and community consultations allow without ignoring truly significant ecological impacts or throwing social licence out the window.

It’s also possible that Hydro-Québec could have helped along its own case by having an on-the-ground presence in the U.S. earlier—Abergel or someone in his shoes should probably have been house-hunting before the pandemic. “One of their mistakes has been to try to conduct this without being present” says Quebec journalist Jean-Benoit Nadeau. “They were essentially subcontracting the representation to someone who was not them.” (That someone is Avangrid.)

In any case Abergel is there now—and for the long haul. If NECEC is ultimately rejected there is still another potential route through another state: Vermont. This would require new permits and more years of discussion and approval—a prospect that Abergel after years of fighting for NECEC doesn’t seem to relish. In September he put an offer down on a century-old house near Lake Placid in upstate New York. There he hopes to find something of an American refuge—a place to bide his time waiting for the next round of court decisions—and whatever appeals or battles follow.

“I like renovations” he says. “It’s like therapy. By mid-October I should have the house and something to do that takes me away a little bit from all of this. I hope.”

Nike has made a huge boom in the NIL game with the announcement that they are signing five basketball players ranging from the high school to college level.

Among the five hoopers that they signed was Stanford's senior guard Haley Jones who helped lead the program to a national title in 2021. She was also named the Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. The senior averaged 13.2 points and 7.9 rebounds per games last season as Stanford made it to the Final Four.

Jones is joined by Iowa's Caitlin Clark four-star Bronny James five-star DJ Wagner and five-star Juju Watkins.

She expressed how much the deal meant to her saying:

“Basketball has given me so much over the years. I’m excited about the opportunity this partnership presents — to give back to my community in more ways than I ever imagined possible” Jones said in a release.

According to On3's NIL Valuation Jones’ is valued at $74k which ranks No. 11 in terms NIL value.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3NuZWFrZXJzL2EvYmVuLWZlbGRlcnN0ZWluL2Jyb25ueS1qYW1lcy1zaWducy10by1uaWtl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bronny James Signs to Nike,"In a move that’s felt inevitable for years now Nike is officially welcoming LeBron James’ son Bronny James to the Swoosh family. Nike announced today that it has signed the younger James to a name image and likeness deal. Along with the eldest son of the four-time NBA champion Nike announced the signings of student athletes Caitlin Clark Haley Jones DJ Wagner and JuJu Watkins.

“For as long as I can remember Nike’s been a part of my family” says Bronny who’s currently a senior at Sierra Canyon High School. “Getting a chance to team up with them and continue my family’s legacy both on the court and in the community is wild—it really means a lot to me.”

Bronny has repped Nike throughout his time at Sierra Canyon lacing up pairs of his father’s shoes as well as a plethora of Kobes KDs and other Nike basketball offerings. Nike says that through this partnership Bronny strives to continue supporting the LeBron James Family Foundation and positively impacting communities that matter most to him.

The new policies are said to increase the restriction on the individuals who are purchasing the shoes.

The new terms indicated by the South Korean office of Nike indicate that the new clause that bans the purchase of sneakers for the sake of reselling will go into effect in October. The news has garnered much attention as Nike shoes are often some of the most popular to be sold on the resale market.

The news comes as Nike Korea realized how resellers have benefitted from the market. Just five days after the Louis Vuitton x Nike Air Force 1 collaboration back in July the shoes which were sold at a fixed price of $2527 USD appeared on the resale market and sold for approximately $9785 USD on another platform KREAM.

Industry insiders believe that Nike is setting the precedent for future resalers and that its revision of its terms and conditions may spearhead the way sneakers are traded. The new policy allows Nike to cancel any orders for purchases if they suspect that the person is buying for the sake of reselling. Nike Korea’s latest move puts the industry on high alert and begs to question if Nike as a whole or other brands will move in the same direction.

The four other athletes are Caitlin Clark Haley Jones DJ Wagner and Juju Watkins.

Bronny who has been wearing LeBron's shoes on the court is no stranger to Nike. His dad signed with them before he was drafted into the NBA and released his first signature shoe two decades ago. The company has played a key part in the elder James' brand and now it's Bronny's turn to sign with Nike as his own career begins.

“For as long as I can remember Nike’s been a part of my family” Bronny told Complex Sports. “Getting a chance to team up with them and continue my family’s legacy both on the court and in the community is wild — it really means a lot to me.”

Bronny turned 18 on Oct. 6 and his father threw him an absolute rager of a party.

With his 18th birthday barely in the rearview we're not that far off from Bronny joining the NBA. He just started his senior year at Sierra Canyon High School and is apparently looking at colleges. (His deal with Nike narrows the numbers of schools he can go to since he can only rep Nike.) He likely won't stay at college more than one year and will almost certainly declare for the NBA draft as soon as he's able."

The Sandusky Register reports that the Columbus Avenue underpass where derailed tank cars of paraffin wax fell to the railway below remained closed as of Monday Oct. 10 following the Saturday derailment which disrupted Amtrak’s Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited [see “NS derailment blocks line …” Trains News Wire Oct. 8 2022].

Normal Amtrak service has since been restored.

The roadway will remain closed until further notice city manager Eric Wobser told the newspaper with the city still needing to assess whether road repairs will be needed after the derailment is cleaned up.

The cause of the derailment remains under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2YW5zdmlsbGVsaXZpbmcuY29tL29uLXRyYWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On Track - Evansville Living Magazine,"Ohio Street notwithstanding when was the last time you were stopped in Evansville by a train? River City commuters traverse dozens of railroad crossings every day but only a few see train traffic.

That first question got us thinking: How many miles of tracks run through Evansville? (Spoiler: More than 50.) Who are the companies that use the tracks and what do they haul? Evansville’s glamour period of passenger travel ended long ago and only freight trains run along the tracks now. We knew little about them so we began exploring.

The Industrial Revolution reshaped many industries one of them being transportation. People and goods began to travel on trains in earnest and rail companies laid down tracks as quickly as they could build them.

According to Southern Indiana Trails the earliest interurban railroad in the Tri-State was the Evansville Suburban & Newburgh Railway (ES&N) incorporated in 1887. Originally it connected passengers and freight in Evansville to Newburgh Indiana and later to Boonville Indiana via Chandler Indiana. Service to Boonville ended in August 1930; Newburgh’s service ceased that December. The Interstate Commerce Commission granted the ES&N’s request to abandon the line in 1948 and later the tracks were scrapped.

The Louisville & Nashville Railroad depot at 300 Fulton Ave. built in 1902 and razed in 1985 served the turn of the century’s growing number of regional travelers and had a front-row seat to the catastrophic Ohio River flood of 1937. The 1882 Tuscan Revival-style Evansville & Terre Haute Railroad station at Eighth and Main streets was replaced by the grand Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad. The Grecian depot became a USO club in 1943 before being demolished in 1965 to make way for the new Civic Center complex. But a part — four parts actually — of the C&EI station lives on: Its limestone Ionic-style pillars now make up the Four Freedoms Monument along Riverside Drive.

Long-trip passenger rail travel fell out of fashion with the debut of the U.S. interstate system in 1956. Now running on almost 140000 route miles the U.S. freight rail network is a nearly $80 billion industry says the U.S. Department of Transportation. It employs more than 167000 people and operates seven Class I railroads and 22 regional and 584 local/short-line railroads. Unlike roadways private organizations own U.S. freight railroads and are responsible for their maintenance and any improvements.

According to geographical information system data from the City of Evansville/Vanderburgh County and the Indiana Department of Transportation five companies populate the rail lines in Vanderburgh County. CSX Transportation owns the two main arteries through town: The CE&D Subdivision line operates 6.7 miles out of Evansville toward northern Indiana while the 9.2-mile Henderson Subdivision runs south toward Nashville Tennessee and crosses the Ohio River. Another five-plus miles of tracks constitute a northern route bypass.

CSX carries the most freight traffic with a capacity of 31000 lifts. Genesee & Wyoming Inc.-owned Indiana Southern Railroad is a short-line partner with CSX and has eight miles of track in Vanderburgh County for carrying freight toward Indianapolis. Indiana Southwestern Railway another CSX short-line partner owned by Pioneer Lines operates on 8 miles of track but carries a commodity precious to Evansville: plastic pellets. Evansville Western Railway and Norfolk Southern Railroad (the former is a CSX operating partner based in Mount Vernon Indiana; the latter does not partner with CSX) run a combined eight miles of freight lines through Evansville. In 2018 Evansville-Vanderburgh County Emergency Management Agency Director Cliff Weaver estimated between 30 and 40 trains rumble through Evansville each day signaling a daily load of thousands of tons of cargo.

The freight cars driving through town often carry agriculture-related goods such as grain chemicals and fertilizer; lumber; and building materials. Norfolk Southern also ships automobiles clothing electronics furniture machinery and coal.

According to CSX coal remains king in terms of rail freight as well as general electricity sources particularly in the Midwest. It is common to see a loaded coal train passing through Evansville position a locomotive in the middle to act as a distributed power unit to help move the coal cars’ massive tonnage.

This is not to say Evansville doesn’t see some interesting rail traffic. Just this summer a Brightline which offers luxury high-speed travel through Central Florida was seen parked at Howell Yard.

Howell Yard erected by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad in 1889 and which helped build up the surrounding namesake town is the conduit that funnels rail freight through Evansville. Now owned by CSX it had humble roots with just a roundhouse repair shop a machine shop and an engine and boiler house. CSX grants passage through Howell Yard to others such as Canadian Pacific the New Orleans Public Belt Railroad and even the U.S. Army.

As rail cars move south out of Evansville they must cross the Ohio River and lucky for them they get to skip the often-congested twin bridges. Rather rail traffic uses a 12123-foot-long bridge connecting Evansville to Henderson Kentucky. Built by L&N Railroad the original bridge was constructed in 1884 and measured 2.3 miles long making it — for a time —the longest channel span of that type in the world. The current bridge was constructed for $4 million and opened on New Year’s Eve in 1932.

When a railroad company wishes to deactivate a line the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Surface Transportation Board must approve it in a filing process that can take as little as 90 days. They also give other interested parties time to offer their proposal for taking over ownership of the line — an advocacy group may want to convert it to a walking trail perhaps or another rail company seeks the tracks for its own right-of-use purposes — but if nothing comes of it the deactivation completes and the tracks are formally declared abandoned.

Abandoned tracks are sometimes removed even paved over. INDOT’s GIS data show others remain as they were such as the 1.7-mile Indiana Southern tracks across St. George Road directly south of Sunset Memorial Gardens Cemetery and the 2.5-mile tracks that spur off CSX’s northern line cross Lynch Road and circle the adjacent industrial park to the east. Along with a 4.3-mile line that ran south along U.S. Highway 41 and a 1.1-mile spur that skimmed Wesselman Woods Nature Preserve and the Evansville State Hospital unused or abandoned tracks — some with only the occasional railroad tie remaining — cover about nine miles in the city.

Evansville’s train tracks even played an important role in one of the city’s darkest days. Air Indiana Flight 216 crashed into a steep ravine shortly after takeoff from Dress Regional Airport on Dec. 13 1977 killing every University of Evansville men’s basketball player coach booster and supporter aboard. As first responders descended on the crash site it quickly became clear that the steep terrain and soggy conditions would make it nearly impossible to traverse the area. With no way to remove bodies and wreckage a boxcar was backed up along the tracks to the crash site. After its precious cargo was loaded it drove out of the ravine and south into Downtown Evansville to the makeshift morgue set up at the C.K. Newsome Community Center on Walnut Street.

Today Evansville sits in a national passenger train travel desert completely bypassed by the Amtrak lines that ferry travelers from Cincinnati Ohio to Chicago Illinois via Indianapolis Indiana and from Chicago to New Orleans Louisiana. The closest Amtrak station to Evansville is on South Illinois Street in Carbondale Illinois slightly more than 100 miles to the west. (Centralia Illinois’ station is a close second at 110 miles away.) Despite fares that can reach as low as $30 one way the time and expense of getting to a station often convince Tri-State travelers to drive instead. With Interstate 69 acting as a conduit from Indianapolis into western Kentucky driving often is a more efficient means of travel anyway.

Although River City residents cannot hop aboard a train to take them out of town there are plenty of vantage points from which to enjoy the sight of locomotives pulling their cargo across the region. A popular sight is when trains exit milepost 314.0 through the bottoms on their way south to cross the Ohio River. Hickory Ridge Road when not flooded offers a prime location for train spotting at this milepost. In time maybe Evansville will return to being passengers instead of spectators. In the meantime we have one heck of a view as freight trains chug through town.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL3JhaWwtd29ya2VyLXN0cmlrZS11bmlvbi1yZWplY3RzLWRlYWwvODIzNzcxNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rail worker strike again a possibility after large union rejects deal,"By Josh Funk

AP Business Writer

OMAHA Neb. — The third largest railroad union rejected its deal with freight railroads Monday – renewing the possibility of a strike that could cripple the economy – but before that could happen both sides will return to the bargaining table.

About 56% of the track maintenance workers represented by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union who voted opposed the five-year contract even though it included 24% raises and $5000 in bonuses. Union President Tony Cardwell said the railroads didn't do enough to address worker concerns about the lack of paid time off – particularly sick time – and demanding working conditions after the major railroads eliminated nearly one-third of their jobs over the past six years.

STRIKE POTENTIAL IMPACT:Looming railroad strike could be 'economic disaster' impacting consumers from all angles

WHAT TO KNOW:What are the railroad unions asking for? Everything you need to know about a rail strike.

""Railroaders are discouraged and upset with working conditions and compensation and hold their employer in low regard. Railroaders do not feel valued"" Cardwell said in a statement. ""They resent the fact that management holds no regard for their quality of life illustrated by their stubborn reluctance to provide a higher quantity of paid time off especially for sickness.""

The railroads didn't immediately comment on the rejected contract.

Four other railroad unions have approved their agreements with the freight railroads that include BNSF Union Pacific Kansas City Southern CSX and Norfolk Southern but all 12 unions that represent a total of 115000 workers must ratify their contracts to prevent a strike. One other union the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers initially rejected its deal but has since renegotiated a new contract. The voting won't be completed until mid-November.

RAIL WORKERS STRIKE:Will other unions seek what the railroad unions are asking for?

President Joe Biden put pressure on the railroads and unions to reach a deal last month ahead of a mid-September deadline to allow a strike or walkout. Many businesses also urged Congress to be ready to intervene in the dispute and block a strike if an agreement wasn't reached because so many companies rely on railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products.

In general the deals the unions agreed to closely follow the recommendations of a special panel of arbitrators that Biden appointed made this summer. That Presidential Emergency Board recommended what would be the biggest raises rail workers have seen in more than four decades but it didn't resolve the unions' concerns about working conditions. Instead it said the unions should pursue additional negotiations or arbitration that can take years with each railroad individually.

The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way union said it agreed to delay any strike until five days after Congress reconvenes in mid-November to allow time for additional negotiations.

Quality of life issues took center stage at the end of these negotiations with the unions that represent conductors and engineers holding out until the end to get three unpaid leave days a year to tend to medical appointments and a promise that railroads will negotiate further about giving those employees regularly scheduled days off where they aren't on call. The engineers and conductors have complained that strict railroad attendance policies make it hard to take any time off.

The track maintenance workers in the BMWED generally have more regular schedules than engineers and conductors but all the rail unions have objected to the lack of paid sick time in the industry – particularly after working to keep trains moving throughout the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZXJhaWxyb2FkaW5nLmNvbS9zaG9ydF9saW5lc19yZWdpb25hbHMvYXJ0aWNsZS9Gcm9tLXByb3ZpZGVyLXRvLXBhcnRuZXItTWlzc2lzc2lwcGktRXhwb3J0LVJhaWxyb2FkLW1hcmtzLTEwMC15ZWFycy0tNjc3MDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rail Insider-From provider to partner: Mississippi Export Railroad marks 100 years.

Rail News: Short Lines & Regionals

By Grace Renderman Associate Editor



As the Mississippi Export Railroad (MSE) celebrates its 100th anniversary this year the short line’s CEO Kate Luce says it’s a time to reflect on the railroad’s past — and plan for the future.

“What 100 years means is … it's a time to reflect on the successes that we've had in the past and the team most importantly that created those past successes” Luce says.

The railroad was founded in 1922 by Luce’s great-great grandfather Gregory Luce. Before he purchased the short line and rechristened it “MSE” it was known as the Alabama & Mississippi Railroad so named in 1915. Before that it had been called the Moss Point & Pascagoula Railroad Co. since 1894.

From there the railroad’s helm was passed down from generation to generation: J.H. Luce took over as president and chairman in 1935 Dwain Luce in 1958 and D. Gregory Luce Jr. in 1986. Kate Luce became MSE’s president and first CEO in 2017.

Along the way the Luces all worked toward common goals: to improve safety recruit good people and partner with southern Mississippi’s communities Kate Luce says. All in the name of making the region a better place.

“We're a short-line railroad so we like to do a little bit of everything for our customers” she says. “We go from being just a service provider just a vendor to being a partner.”

A brief history

Headquartered in Moss Point Mississippi the railroad hauls such commodities as coal wood pellets and liquefied petroleum gas across 42 miles of track between Pascagoula and Evanston. The short line interchanges with four Class Is — CN CSX Kansas City Southern and Norfolk Southern Railway — and handles switching operations with the Terminal Alabama State Docks and Port of Pascagoula.

In 1940 MSE became one of the first railroads in Mississippi to acquire a diesel-electric locomotive; six years later it purchased the only locomotive produced by Ingalls Shipbuilding a primary producer of U.S. Navy ships according to the short line’s website.

MSE was featured in the CBS television show On the Road with Charles Kuralt a program that aired from 1967 to 1980 and focused on America’s rural roads. Kuralt discovered the railroad’s gandy dancers the chanting repair crews who used to work along the tracks.

Throughout the 1990s MSE worked to develop the Helena Industrial Park a 125-acre site owned by MSE and located adjacent to the rail line. With flagship tenants Tindall Corp. and Airgas the site includes a 40000-square-foot warehouse and connections to CN CSX KCS and NS. The park was recertified as “project-ready” in 2016 and named a CN rail-ready site in 2021.

In 2013 the railroad completed construction on the Escatawpa River Terminal a 9.5-acre site that allows for five to seven car spots per switch and storage of more than 600 freight cars. It also offers two standard barge spaces with a 14-foot draft on the Pascagoula River which leads to Pascagoula Harbor and the Intracoastal Waterway a shipping route that extends 3000 miles across the Atlantic and Gulf Coast shores.

Today the railroad serves four industrial rail sites in Escatawpa Helena Lucedale and Moss Point where MSE is headquartered.

Kate Luce’s journey

Luce wasn’t always sure she’d make rail her career. She studied business at Auburn University and worked for a summer at MSE doing clerical duties. That summer sparked her interest she says.

Luce changed her field of study enrolling in Auburn’s supply-chain management program. After graduating in 2009 she was named MSE’s transportation manager later that year.

To “expand her horizon” Luce went back to school at Duke University for her MBA in 2013 completing the program in 2015. She left the railroad for three years to do consulting work and returned to MSE as chief operating officer in 2016. The next year she was named the railroad’s first female president and CEO.

“I've been lucky to have great mentors and great teachers and those people encouraged me to follow my heart and come back to the business” Luce says. “I set some pretty big goals for what I wanted to accomplish.”

One of those mentors is Mark Miller who served as the railroad’s vice president of operations until he retired last year.

There are few female short-line leaders out there. But beyond gender leading a short line is all about rolling up your sleeves and committing to bringing value to the business Luce says.

“It's neat as a woman to see more women contributing to railroading” she says adding that we “need a lot of smart smart minds on [our team] whatever form that takes.”

“A lot of what we do as we look to the future is figuring out how to put together the pieces of this puzzle” Luce adds.

As for the next 100 years...

The piecing-together process requires re-examination on occasion. What’s worked in the past or is working now may not work tomorrow so it’s important the MSE team doesn’t become complacent Luce says.

“We’ve got to kick it into high gear to create another 100 [years]” she says.

Simply going with the tide isn’t an option.

“We want to create that momentum within ourselves and within our business"" Luce says.

What is the railroad doing to kick it up a notch? Investing heavily in its rail-car repair side business; building its first railroad subsidiary; and expanding operations in warehousing port access and transloading.

Meanwhile MSE’s only subsidiary the Alabama Export Railroad began operations on just over 12 miles of track in downtown Mobile in 2019 and will continue to expand its connections to the Port of Mobile. MSE is also slated to bring a new car-repair facility online in 2024.

""Something my dad has always said to me is that change does not guarantee improvement but improvement rarely comes without change” Luce says.

Luce’s father has been a monumental influence on her leadership style. He taught her “people are the future of business” she says. It’s also about corporate sustainability and not just the environmental kind. Bringing in good people is key to making the business stronger and more diverse Luce says.

It also approved a third multi-use trail that connects to Spartanburg’s 55-mile urban trail system called The Dan.

Laura Ringo executive director of Play Advocate and Live Well (PAL) of Spartanburg asked the council to provide $300657 from the county's trails fund to complete a section that connects the Drayton and Beaumont mill villages nearly a half-mile from Lawson's Fork Creek.

The $300000 will be added to $175000 in Mary Black Foundation grant funds for a total of $475657 the amount quoted by Roebuck Landscaping to complete the section she said.

Ned Barrett trail development manager for PAL said work on the Beaumont Trail will start this fall.

""The canopied underpass is complete except for a final detail that will be finished this month"" Barrett said.

The trail climbs a steep slope requiring ""significant portions"" of retaining wall to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act Ringo said.

The trails bank is a county fund with $2.3 million in revenues primarily from the hospitality tax that is used to leverage federal and state funds and private grants for trails projects.

Ringo said since the trails bank is already funded there is no new cost to the county.

Canopied trail section at bottom of Drayton Trail nears completion

Ringo also said $20000 is needed to finish the fencing along a canopied trail section under the Norfolk Southern trestle at the bottom of the Drayton Trail Ringo said. Once the fencing is completed this will close out the project with Norfolk Southern so the trail can open to the public she said.

To date PAL has spent $714000 on the canopied trail with $203000 coming from the trails bank and the remainder from private sources she said.

15-mile RAISE Trail planned along Fairforest Creek

Finally Ringo asked for up to $1.5 million for preconstruction activities for the planned 15-mile RAISE Trail route along the Fairforest Creek starting at Mayfair Lofts on the northern end to C.C. Woodson Recreation Center on the southern end.

Preconstruction activities include engineering surveying title searches on 56 properties and the execution of easements.

Complete trail system better gatewaysWhat Spartanburg could look like in 2027

There is also an extension planned to the Spartanburg Memorial Airport and across highway 295 to R.P. Dawkins Middle School.

The U.S. Department of Transportation in November 2021 awarded Spartanburg County a $23.8 million RAISE grant (Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity).

The project will include a 10-foot wide asphalt multi-use pathway a pedestrian bridge over Highway 295 five pre-fabricated pedestrian bridges wayfinding signs. and crossing improvements at Powell Mill Road U.S. 29/W.O. Ezell Boulevard John B. White and U.S. 221/Church Street.

Preconstruction work will begin on the RAISE trail this winter with construction set to begin in the fall of 2024 he said. Work is projected to be finished by September 2029.

Countywide trail system expandingSpartanburg County backs grant requests to expand countywide trail system

More Spartanburg County trail projects in the works

Last year County Council backed two requests to complete the 2.55-mile Anderson Mill Road/Old Georgia Road path as well as the 8-mile Wadsworth Trail that connects a dozen neighborhoods to the North Tyger River and the restored Anderson Mill.

This past July Spartanburg area lawmakers obtained a $5 million state budget earmark for the 31-mile Saluda Grade Trail project which will allow three nonprofits to purchase the 16-mile South Carolina portion of the former Norfolk Southern rail line.

The line will be converted to trails connecting Inman Campobello and Landrum in northern Spartanburg County to the North Carolina towns of Saluda Tryon and Zirconia in Henderson County.

The Beta version allows users to experiment with the protocol’s cross-DEX spot margin trading. With the Beta launch Primex also introduces the new Referral Program for early users offering benefits to early registrants and referral-based rewards.

DeFi holds the potential to financially empower investors and traders in ways that were previously unimaginable in the traditional financial world. Despite that most of the existing DEXs with margin trading features still use centralized trade execution mechanisms and feature a limited number of assets available for margin trading as derivatives.

Primex decentralizes the trade-execution mechanism to enable a wider variety of actions on DEXs. Instead of centralized order books all automated trade executions on Primex are carried out by a network of Keepers. Consequently decentralization can be maintained throughout the entire trading process from creating an order to closing the position.

The Beta version of Primex’s protocol introduces key features such as:

Spot trading without leverage: Primex Traders will now be able to use different types of orders—stop loss take profit and limit orders—for non-leveraged spot trades in a decentralized manner facilitating the trade of cryptocurrency pairs without leverage.

Primex Splitter: A new mechanism that functions as an aggregation solution that splits up swaps across multiple DEXs and helps users make their trades more efficiently by reducing slippage and finding the best swap rates without any additional fees.

Open Position and Order Modification: Introducing the ability for users to modify the deposit Take Profit/Stop Loss (TP/SL) limit price and leverage of open orders.

Spot Orders and Positions Data: Expanded data display to include information about each Trader's spot orders and positions.

WalletConnect Integration: In addition to MetaMask users can now use WalletConnect widening the variety of crypto wallets connected to Primex.

New DEX Integrations: Primex Beta supports two new DEXs (Curve and Balancer) as well as Uniswap v3 pools with different fees.

Bucket Reserves: A new mechanism that automatically moves part of the traders’ fees to the Reserve Pool of each Credit Bucket to insure them against potential losses.

Multi-Language Support: The Primex platform is now available in seven more languages to provide access to a more localized and user-friendly experience.

In addition to the new mechanisms introduced with Primex Beta the Referral Program offers rewards in exchange for inviting new users to the platform. Connections and referral contributions are automatically tracked utilizing smart contracts to store the data transparently on-chain. Furthermore the Early User Program grants participation in private challenges for a chance to earn exclusive prizes and access to the Primex private Discord channels. Ultimately early users can also participate in the Ambassador Program to earn exclusive ambassador-only rewards.

“We are right on track to fulfilling our mission of defragmenting the DeFi markets via the new prime brokerage protocol that offers users open access to a truly decentralized spot margin trading experience across numerous DEXs and blockchains” says Vlad Kostanda Co-Founder and CEO of Primex. ”This new upgrade will enhance how the protocol works while bringing our team one step closer to Primex's mainnet launch.”

The U.S. Army awarded Northrop a research and development contract in May 2020 to start working on the Survivability Against Integrated and Networked Threats (SAINT) software tool. (Lockheed Martin received a similar contract four months later to develop a competing version.) The technology is now ready to advance to flight demonstrations Brendan Kelly Northrop’s director of Vertical Lift and Ground told reporters Oct. 11 at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting in Washington.

“We’re working to get it out to some demonstration space and show the operational value as quickly as possible” Kelly said.

In a demonstration staged for reporters the SAINT tool received and fused data from multiple federated sensors onboard an FVL aircraft. The sensors included Northrop’s Athena missile warning system APR-39(V)2 digital radar warning receiver and Raptor radar. Offboard sensor data also was fed into a processor running the SAINT application.

Although the demonstration used only Northrop sensors Kelly said the SAINT could be used with any sensor that complies with the standards being established by Army’s FVL Enterprise Architecture Framework.

Using the sensor data the SAINT application identified a threat in the flight path of the FVL aircraft then recommended a flight path change to the flight crew Kelly said. The tool also orchestrated the rescheduling of loiter times for air-launched affects and the timing of suppression-of-enemy-air-defense operations which were affected by the FVL aircraft’s flight path change to avoid the threat.

The tool is designed to help future FVL crews survive in airspace defended by networked air defenses but is not foolproof against lesser threats. During the demonstration the FVL aircraft’s new routing allowed it to avoid an advanced surface to air missile threat but the aircraft instead flew into an area defended by man-portable air defense systems which fire heat-seeking missiles. The FVL aircraft used flares dispensed by the Common Infrared Countermeasures systems to defeat the incoming missile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbm93Lm5vcnRocm9wZ3J1bW1hbi5jb20vc2hhcmstZXZvbHV0aW9uLXRocm91Z2gtdGhlLW1pbGxlbm5pYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shark Evolution Through the Millennia,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5YWVyb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9zZW5zb3JzL2FydGljbGUvMTQyODM4ODkvcmFkYXItbWlzc2lsZS1kZWZlbnNlLXN1cmZhY2Utd2Fyc2hpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,radar missile-defense surface warships,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Navy missile-defense experts are asking the DRS Laurel Technologies segment of Leonardo DRS in Johnstown Pa. to provide AN/SPQ-9B shipboard anti-ship missile defense (ASMD) radar systems to help protect U.S. Navy surface warships from enemy anti-ship missiles.

Officials of the Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington announced a $8.7 million order to DRS Laurel last month to build AN/SPQ-9B radar systems and support equipment.

DRS in April 2018 displaced Northrop Grumman Corp. as the Navy's AN/SPQ-9B shipboard radar contractor in a $64.3 million deal. That contract which combined purchases for the Navy and the government of Japan included options that could bring its cumulative value to $263 million.

The AN/SPQ-9B is an X-band pulse-Doppler frequency-agile radar that scans out to the horizon and performs simultaneous and automatic air and surface target detection and tracking of low flying anti-ship cruise missiles surface threats low-and-slow-flying aircraft unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and helicopters.

The missile-defense radar is designed for the littoral environment in harbors and along coastlines rejects clutter and has a low false track rate in the littorals and in other high-clutter environments. Its design makes the most of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and non-developmental item (NDI) equipment.

The unattended radar consists of four air-cooled below-deck cabinets a motor generator and one above-deck antenna unit designed for low-radar-cross-section reflectivity appropriate for stealth ship design.

The AN/SPQ-9B is for aircraft carriers amphibious assault ships cruisers Coast Guard maritime security cutters Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and allied cruisers and destroyers.

Above decks the radar uses a mechanically rotating electronically stabilized antenna. The 1500-pound antenna consists of dual planar arrays mounted back-to-back each connected to independent transmitters and receivers. Below decks the radar consists of processor receiver/exciter and transmitter cabinets; radar set control; and motor generator.

The processor cabinet performs signal processing tracking and interface functions. The receiver/exciter has three receivers and generates system frequencies and clocks. The transmitter cabinet receives the RF pulses from the receiver/exciter and amplifies them for output to the antenna.

The radar set control provides remote control and monitoring of radar operation in the ship's combat information center. The output of each receiver is converted to digital baseband I-Q data for Doppler processing in the processor cabinet. The system has an auxiliary antenna for electronic counter-countermeasures.

The AN/SPQ-9B radar has digital interfaces to the Aegis combat systems the MK 34 gun weapon system (GWS) the MK 48 GWS the Cooperative Engagement Capability and ship self defense system.

On this order DRS Laurel will do the work in Largo Fla. and should be finished by May 2025.

A contract for the mission code-named Victus Nox was awarded Sept. 30 to launch services provider Firefly Aerospace and satellite manufacturer Millennium Space. Once the Space Force decides when the mission must launch it will give Millennium a few months to produce the spacecraft and Firefly will only get 24 hours’ notice to get ready for liftoff.

The point of Victus Nox — Latin for ‘conquer the night’ — is to demonstrate fast turnaround launch operations known as tactically responsive space and to help planners figure out the front-end processes leading up to the launch. This capability strategists warn will be needed during an armed conflict to augment constellations or replace satellites that adversaries would damage or blow up.

“We need to be able to get to the point where we can go launch a rocket a mission in 24 hours and get that data flowing” Brig. Gen. Stephen Purdy the Space Force’s program executive officer for assured access to space said Sept. 20 at the Air & Space Forces Association annual conference.

A 24-hour call-up is “almost unobtainium right now” he said. “But we need to get to that point.”

The idea of responsive space launch has been talked about for years but is now gaining attention due to congressional and industry advocacy as well as world events that have shown the strategic value of satellites making them more attractive targets.

Congress has criticized the Pentagon for not moving more quickly in this area and over the past two years inserted $65 million into the defense budget for tactically responsive spaceflight demonstrations. For 2023 the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee are proposing $100 million although the final amount has yet to be negotiated.

“As vividly demonstrated by Russia’s 2021 destructive anti-satellite test threats to our critical national security space assets continue to increase both from adversary on-orbit and terrestrial counter-space capabilities and from space debris” a bipartisan group of 25 lawmakers wrote in a letter sent in January to appropriators.

Meanwhile the United States is “not currently positioned with an operational capability to rapidly replace assets in orbit that are degraded disabled or destroyed or to rapidly launch satellites for urgent new missions” the letter said.

Small-satellite launch companies like Virgin Orbit and Rocket Lab have lobbied for this funding arguing that the Defense Department should create a program of record with long-term budgets for tactically responsive launch. The letter to appropriators said “robust investment in tactically responsive small launch in 2022 will help accelerate this emerging industry’s efforts to lower launch costs.”

Amid congressional pressure to accelerate responsive launch demonstrations the Space Force in June 2021 conducted the Tactically Responsive Launch-2 (TacRL-2) mission on a Northrop Grumman air-launched Pegasus XL rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base California.

Northrop Grumman was given 21 days’ notice to get ready to launch a small surveillance satellite to low Earth orbit.

The Space Force has since renamed the program Tactically Responsive Space so Victus Nox will be TacRS-3. The name change emphasizes that launch is just one piece of what it takes to accelerate space missions.

IT’S MORE THAN JUST LAUNCH

Gen. John “Jay” Raymond chief of space operations of the U.S. Space Force has been a long-time proponent of using commercial systems to speed up the military’s much slower development cycles.

In an interview with SpaceNews Raymond noted that responsive space is far from a new concept but it is now more achievable because of the technology and business practices introduced by the commercial industry.

In 2005 when Raymond was a strategist at the Defense Department’s Office of Force Transformation he co-authored a paper with the office director Adm. Arthur Cebrowski titled “Operationally Responsive Space: A New Defense Business Model.”

The paper said DoD should have the ability “to reconstitute larger space capabilities if adversaries succeed in finally developing capabilities to negate them.”

Raymond said that paper was ahead of its time because the technology was not available to do responsive space missions. “Now if we do this right it will allow us to capitalize more on commercial capabilities.”

Even to this day national security space launch is a process that begins years in advance and relies on expensive fixed infrastructure he noted. There are now more flexible launch options like airplanes that deploy small rockets and small vertical launch vehicles that can operate from multiple locations.

But what still has to be worked out is the “end to end” process for responsive space Raymond said. No matter how quickly rockets can get to the pad it doesn’t matter if the satellites are not ready and there are regulatory requirements that have to be coordinated.

The next major step for responsive space is to “develop the operational concept for how you replenish these constellations and how you might use responsive capabilities” said Raymond.

Also needed is a clearly articulated requirement that has to be approved by the Pentagon in order to get funded he said. “We’ve got to figure out the operational concepts and then have the requirements as we continue to experiment.”

A requirement is being drafted by U.S. Space Command the organization responsible for determining a response plan if satellites come under attack. Raymond said demonstrations like TacRS-3 would help the command understand the art of the possible. There will likely be more demo flights “but I want to progress from just doing experiments to no-kidding real capability.”

Raymond’s successor as chief of space operations Lt. Gen. B. Chance Saltzman said he intends to continue to support tactically responsive launch efforts.

“If confirmed the most critical issue I would address is expanding the scope of tactically responsive space to ensure we generate complete operational capabilities” he said in written testimony submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee for his Sept. 13 confirmation hearing.

“We must have end-to-end capabilities that include launch vehicles satellites ground systems and operational concepts” he said. “And most importantly the specific requirements of the combatant commanders that enable a tangible response to potential adversary destabilizing actions in space.”

TABLETOP EXERCISE AT CAPE CANAVERAL

The Space Systems Command in September held a three-day tabletop exercise at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Florida to examine the processes and the bureaucratic ins and outs of launching payloads on short notice.

Col. James Horne Space Systems Command’s deputy director of operations said the lessons from this exercise would help plan the TacRS-3 mission and inform future budgets.

A takeaway from the tabletop exercise said Horne is the need to involve all stakeholders including the Space Force U.S. Space Command the Federal Aviation Administration the Federal Communications Commission and other agencies that have regulatory responsibilities.

“We looked at how we would execute a responsive launch all the way from receiving orders from the combat commanders to delivering usable data to the warfighter with boots on the ground” said Capt. Benjamin Vowell chief of wargames and exercises at Space Systems Command.

“We learned that there are organizational things that we need to work through” said Vowell. “This exercise was a way for us to pull the various threads and understand how we can enable responsive space.”

A central question for example is what it will take to integrate a satellite on the rocket so the launch provider can meet the 24-hour call-up. Processes like frequency allocation and approval and notifications to ships and aircraft would have to be dramatically accelerated.

The infrastructure needed to conduct rapid launches is another major issue said Master Sergeant Travis Ferguson launch operations manager at Space Systems Command.

“Our first option may be to just turn to a commercial contract and buy a capability depending on what mission area you’re talking about” he said. “Or we could turn to an ally and ask them if we can use their assets.”

Lt. Gen. Michael Guetlein head of Space Systems Command said the demonstration in 2023 will give decision makers a better grasp of “where tactically responsive space can fill a wartime or crisis requirement.”

Back in 2018 similar questions were raised by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency when it announced a Launch Challenge prize competition.

DARPA offered $10 million to any space company that could launch a payload to low Earth orbit with just a few days to prepare and do it again a couple weeks later. The effort was unsuccessful and ended when Astra the lone challenge participant scrubbed its launch in Kodiak Alaska less than a minute before liftoff.

Chris Bassler a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said DARPA’s launch challenge shined a spotlight on responsive space but didn’t drive any policy or funding decisions at DoD.

The proliferation of anti-satellite weapons means it’s just a matter of time before the United States faces a real-world situation when it will need to restock Bassler said.

DoD and the Space Force have stood by over the past couple of years while Congress has kept adding money to the program Bassler said. The Space Force’s explanation that it doesn’t have specific requirements for rapid-response launch he said is a weak excuse.

“They do have a requirement to provide space capability even if attacked or degraded so it’s implicit that they need replenishment options and that is something that should be funded” he added.

Investments in spaceports and agreements to launch from foreign countries would be needed in order to move away from DoD’s dependence on East and West Coast ranges he said. The Space Force also needs to start working with multiple launch providers to try out different concepts and should accelerate the use of in-orbit servicing so satellites can be repaired.

The responsive space demonstration missions are a step in the right direction Bassler said. However things are still “moving very slowly considering the threat pace that keeps being talked about China clearly being the most concerning.”

DOD IS AN ESSENTIAL CUSTOMER FOR SMALLSAT LAUNCHERS

A military program focused on launching payloads in short order creates a major opportunity for small vehicles that can deploy from nontraditional spaceports said Mandy Vaughn industry consultant and former president of Virgin Orbit’s national security launch business.

DoD efforts in this area would be welcomed by small satellite launchers that are facing lagging demand in the commercial sector she said. The Space Force “definitely realizes that the small and medium portions of the launch market are part of the architecture that they need moving forward” she said. “They need a diversity of solutions and modalities.”

Despite the popularity of big-rocket rideshares for responsive launch they will need dedicated vehicles to reach specific orbits Vaughn noted.

Rocket Lab for example in April changed the target orbit of two BlackSky imaging satellites at the last minute after the customer decided it needed to increase coverage over Ukraine.

“This shows that having a diversity of launch solutions is important” said Vaughn.

Small launch vehicles currently in operation include Northrop Grumman’s Minotaur 1 and Pegasus XL Rocket Lab’s Electron Virgin Orbit’s Launcher One and the winner of TacRS-3 Firefly which performed its first successful orbital launch Oct. 1 just hours after the Space Force announced the $17.6 million contract award.

“We are honored to be chosen by Space Force for this important national security mission” Bill Weber CEO of Firefly Aerospace said in a statement. “Now more than ever our country needs the ability for quick response capabilities to combat threats in space.”

Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit recently rolled out marketing campaigns focused on responsive launch services.

In July Rocket Lab which also builds small satellites announced a “24/7 rapid call-up launch capability and streamlined satellite build and operation options.” The company touts its ability to launch from New Zealand and Virginia’s Wallops Island.

On July 13 and August 4 Rocket Lab launched two separate national security missions for the National Reconnaissance Office. The company said the rapid turnaround between those launches demonstrated responsive space.

Virgin Orbit which deploys small rockets from a Boeing 747 aircraft in August released a marketing video on responsive launch featuring the company’s strategic advisers former U.S. defense secretary Ash Carter former director of national intelligence Dennis Blair and retired Air Force lieutenant general Susan Helms.

“Our current space posture is too vulnerable to attacks that could occur too quickly” Carter said in the video. “And that is where the ability to launch rapidly to launch from anywhere and to launch into any orbit is so important.”

Helms recalled participating in wargames of conflict scenarios in the South China Sea. “What we didn’t really have was responsiveness of launch something everybody knew would help us in the exercise” she said.

Dan Piemont president and co-founder of ABL Space said the company did not compete for the TacRS-3 contract because its RS1 launch vehicle is not yet operational. “But we’re definitely interested in the program long term” he said. “We’ve been engaged with leadership of the Space Force and other agencies that are interested in this type of capability as well.”

Responsive space has been a talking point for years said Piemont but with these upcoming experiments “the focus is understanding what needs to be done to conduct a useful launch within 24 hours of a call-up.”

The Space Force and the industry need to figure out what level of readiness they would need in wartime said Piemont. “You would likely need the rocket basically pre-positioned and maintained at a high state of alert.”

CONGRESS KEEPS PUSHING

In a July report Senate appropriators chided DoD for not moving more quickly to create a responsive space program. The defense appropriations subcommittee which recommended adding $100 million in fiscal year 2023 said a responsive launch program of record is needed to ensure U.S. combatant commanders can “rapidly place and reconstitute space assets.”

Defense appropriators also noted that the Secretary of the Air Force failed to provide an acquisition strategy for responsive space as the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act directed. Meanwhile the fiscal year 2023 president’s budget request “does not include any resources to establish the program despite a need to counter adversarial launches of disruptive technologies in a tactically relevant timeline.”

The House version of the 2023 NDAA calls for a long-term budget line for tactically responsive space and for the Space Force to lay out a program with wargames tabletop and operational exercises.

“Given the successful Tactically Responsive Launch-2 mission” said the House bill “the Space Force should continue to broaden tactically responsive space efforts with a focus on rapid reconstitution and responsiveness.”

Port Project Begins

The new port project a privately funded $80 million partnership venture between the Alaskan native Huna Totem Corporation and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings that had been announced in late March officially broke ground on October 10 2022.

The choice to begin the collaboration on Indigenous Peoples’ Day was deliberate and marks the great hope both parties have in the benefits such a project will bring.

“The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act happened over 50 years ago and when you consider its vision it was about the opportunity for Alaska Native corporations to work collaboratively with the State of Alaska and municipalities to build economic opportunities for communities for our shareholders and for all Alaskans” said Russell Dick Huna Totem Corporation CEO and President.

Executives and authorities from Huna Totem Corporation the Whittier community Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and the government of Alaska were all on hand to celebrate the momentous occasion and what it represents for the region.

“Huna Totem is an Alaska company that understands the values that Alaskans hold and they’ve done a good job working to understand the complicated issues that we here in the city of Whittier are trying to overcome” said Dave Dickason mayor of Whittier. “This project is good for the city of Whittier and good for the State of Alaska.”

Whittier is located 50 miles southeast of Anchorage and is an embarkation or debarkation point for many one-way Alaska cruise itineraries. Currently Princess Cruises and Holland America Line both visit Whittier.

About the New Facility

While few details of the overall project have been released this first phase will likely feature a double-sided cruise ship dock and terminal as well as arrival areas for tour buses and options for local retail establishments.

Ships from all three of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ brands – Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises – will be able to dock at the new facility. This gives travelers great options for visiting the area and experiencing all Alaska has to offer.

“This is one of the best arrival experiences you’ll have in Alaska” Dick said. According to Alaska News Source the first phase is expected to be completed by spring of 2024.

Further phases of the project are likely to expand the space with additional retail opportunities hotel rooms housing a cultural center and locally-focused museum amphitheater playgrounds boat launches and more.

“This 80-million-dollar project will create jobs economic activity and revenue for the great city of Whitter” said Mike Dunleavy Alaska’s governor. “This makes Whittier more than just a destination not just for our outside guests but for folks like us that live here all year long.”

Continuing Partnerships

The Whittier project is not the first time Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has partnered with the Huna Totem Corporation to develop facilities with native Alaskans in mind.

“Norwegian Cruise Line’s commitment to Alaska goes back decades” said Juan Kuryla Norwegian Cruise Line Senior Vice President. “We were the first cruise line to sail to Alaska from Seattle. That commitment continues today here in Whittier and we could not be prouder to once again partner with Huna Totem.”

The two organizations partnered together to create Icy Strait Point near Hoonah Alaska a destination that focuses on authentic Alaskan experiences and showcases local artwork handicrafts and history. The popular port of call opened in 2021.

In August 2022 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings also donated waterfront property in Juneau for the development of a new pier and adjacent facilities also in partnership with Huna Totem Corporation.

As the nation shifts focus to rebuild better with safe sustainable and resilient infrastructure steel production in America is more critical than ever. And how that steel is made matters. Nucor Corporation is delivering both safe and sustainable infrastructure solutions beginning with its raw materials produced in south Louisiana.

DRI: A GREENER PROCESS

In its state-of-the-art facility in St. James Parish Nucor Steel Louisiana produces natural gas-based direct reduced iron—or DRI—which is blended with recycled scrap in Nucor’s steel mills to make higher grades of steel. Making new steel from DRI and scrap forms the foundation for the sustainable steel used to build onshore and offshore wind towers solar installations electric vehicle and other critical infrastructure for our modern American economy.

DRI is made from high-grade iron ore reduced by natural gas at extremely high temperatures to provide highly-metallicized refined iron pellets. By using natural gas our DRI plant emits only half of the CO2 compared to iron produced in blast furnaces at traditional integrated steel mills. Following production DRI is shipped by barge on the Mississippi River from the St. James facility to Nucor steel mills nationwide.

What products are made with DRI?

High-quality steel products require a pure iron source like Nucor’s DRI to be blended with scrap metal to meet stringent quality standards for example:

• High strength sheet for safer lighter automobiles

• Heavy gauge plate for offshore wind tower foundations

• Galvanized solar torque tube for America’s expanding solar energy markets

• Armor plate for military Humvees aircraft carriers and destroyers

• High quality American steel products for heavy equipment farming equipmentappliances HVAC systems and other applications

“Producing DRI with natural gas allows Nucor to make the higher grades of steel increasingly demanded by our customers while maintaining our low carbon production advantage over competitors in Europe and Asia that make steel in high-emissions blast furnaces” said Calvin Hart General Manager Nucor Steel Louisiana.

ENVIROMENTAL PIONEER

Nucor pioneered the process of making steel in the U.S. by recycling scrap metal in Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs). Last year Nucor recycled nearly 23 million tons of ferrous scrap metal to produce new steel that is 100% recyclable. The company is North America’s largest steel producer and its largest recycler of any type of material. Today more than 70% of steel made in the U.S. is produced in EAFs making this country the cleanest place in the world to produce steel.

Using EAFs Nucor’s corporate-wide greenhouse gas emissions intensity is less than one-quarter the global average and one-fifth of traditional integrated steel producers which make steel by burning iron ore and coking coal. As part of its environmental commitment Nucor Corporation has invested over $350 million in environmental process equipment over the last decade to make its operations even safer and more efficient. Nucor Corporation is also the largest buyer of renewable electricity among American steelmakers and is one of the largest corporate buyers overall.

“Our goal is to be the safest and most sustainable steel company in the world. Nucor has invested more than $15 billion dollars in the U.S. over the last decade to grow our portfolio of sustainably made steel products and we are proud to be able to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint throughout the supply chain” said Hart.

(KAIT) - With the Mississippi River approaching near-record low levels the nation’s largest steelmaker located in Mississippi County is pulling the plug on barge shipments.

According to Bloomberg.com Nucor Corp. announced it will not load barges for a few weeks to avoid having material stuck on the river.

The decision comes after the largest U.S. barge operator Ingram Barge Co. “declared force majeure on some shipments due to low-water conditions disrupting normal operations through the river.”

With barge companies no longer taking orders Bloomberg noted that companies are paying a premium to move everything from steel and aluminum to grain by rail and truck at prices nearly five times higher than by barge.

“Shipments of coal and petroleum also have been rerouted” Monday’s article noted. “But these other modes of transportation aren’t an effective solution.”

“One 15-barge tow has the same freight capacity as 940 semi-trucks” Mike Steenhoek executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition was quoted as saying. “However this efficiency is predicated on normal water conditions which unfortunately do not currently exist.”

U.S. steel prices continued to drop throughout September. However declines for both hot rolled coil prices and cold rolled coil prices slowed to a sideways trend. Plate prices which have shown the most strength of steel prices traded down for the second consecutive month. They now sit at their lowest level since September 2021.

Steel and other commodity markets are constantly shifting. Get all of the latest updates with MetalMiner’s weekly newsletter.

U.S. Steel Idles Two Furnaces as Steel Prices Slide

As steel prices continue their slow descent one steelmaker appears eager to cut capacity. In early September U.S. Steel idled its 1.5 million short ton per year blast furnace with no scheduled restart date. The company attributed the decision to “high import levels and market conditions.” Most likely this was a reference to the steep price declines among steel commodities since October 2021.

More recently U.S. Steel announced the indefinite idling of its 1.4 million-short-ton-per-year Mon Valley blast furnace. The furnace was previously taken offline on September 3 for maintenance. Although the company initially planned to return it to production after 30 days they later announced it would remain idle. According to a company statement management wished to “balance our production with our order book.”

The steelmaker’s latest decisions suggest that the domestic markets continue to grapple with oversupply despite the loss of competitively priced European imports. Amid many compounding economic pressures demand has begun to show signs of easing. Meanwhile ongoing ramp-ups from new and expanded mills continue to inflate domestic capacity.

Over the past six months steel production has enjoyed an upward trend. Imports however continue to decline from March highs.

Following $120/St Drop Nucor to Keep Plate Prices Flat

U.S. Steel is not alone in its attempts to stop the decent of steel prices. After complaints over the record-high spread between HRC and plate prices Nucor dropped plate prices by $120/st in late July. The company also attempted (albeit unsuccessfully) to raise HRC prices by $50/st. Since that announcement plate prices have fallen $168/st.

Following two months of declines the steelmaker now wishes to push the plate price trend sideways again. In early Octobor Nucor announced no change to November plate prices from its last quote of $1620/st. That said it’s uncertain whether the latest move will stick. It’s true that the spread between the late-April peak and current prices continues to expand. However the overall declines thus far have been slow with plate prices diverging from the much steeper descents of HRC CRC and HDG. That said U.S. plate prices still hold a premium over their global counterparts. This means domestic market dynamics will largely determine future price direction.

Europe Looks to Protect Steel Sector After Curtailments

Meanwhile European countries have begun implementing emergency measures to mitigate rising energy prices. The steel sector is among multiple energy-intensive industries that are particularly vulnerable to the ongoing energy crisis thus impacting steel prices. Rising input costs on top of eroding demand have already caused a wave of curtailments that threaten the viability of Europe’s entire metal sector.

By late September Italy approved energy bonuses for companies. As part of the decree operating steel producers will receive a 40% tax discount for energy spending from October through November. According to the GMK Center scrap processors will receive a 30% discount.

Germany is particularly vulnerable due to its outsized reliance on Russian gas. The country assembled two multi-billion dollar aid packages at the beginning and end of September in hopes of bridling energy prices. The first of those packages earmarked €1.7 billion to provide tax benefits to 9000 energy-intensive businesses.

Beginning in October the UK established electricity price limits for British companies which could cut wholesale prices by half. This policy will last for six months. However scheduled governmental reviews will determine any support beyond that date (March 2023). This will continue to impact steel prices.

Many of the measures approved thus far appear limited in scope considering the energy crisis could realistically last years. It remains uncertain how effective these efforts will be in preventing the permanent loss of European steel capacity in the long term. However recent actions suggest that countries see protecting their industrial sectors as strategically important. This appears a stark contrast with placing the focus only on individual consumers.

European countries have thus far allocated roughly €500 billion in total to the energy crisis. This should go a long way in helping to minimize European sourcing disruptions for the capacity that remains operational.

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvY29tcHV0aW5nL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDkwLXJldmlldy1hLW1vbnN0ZXItNGstZ2FtaW5nLWdwdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Review: A Monster 4K Gaming GPU,"Saying Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 GPU is the fastest GeForce card the company's ever released is true but meaningless -- it would be more notable if it weren't the fastest to date. But it is really really powerful and if you're looking to upgrade from an RTX 3080 Ti or lower in search of a kick-ass 4K gaming (or creating) experience it's the one to beat. Well at least until we see what AMD's Radeon RX 7000-series GPUs can do in November.

But that's only if you take price out of the equation: At $1600 (£1699 AU$2959) it's out of reach for most folks. And as a triple-slot 5.4-inch tall 450-watt card the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is out of reach for a lot of systems as well.

Big and power-hungry Using the four-headed power adapter gets ugly

But I really wouldn't buy one before the discount season starts in mid-November. Yes the price is high but it's not gougingly overpriced given its performance; it's just suffering from the business-as-usual taking-advantage-of-FOMO markup. (Big caveat: I haven't tested the RTX 3090 Ti.) The RTX 3090 launched two years ago at $1499 and the RTX 3090 Ti in March 2022 for $2000; prices on the latter have since dropped to $1550 and below. If you can't or don't want to spend that much money now don't.

In the absence of performance results for the RTX 4080s and whatever AMD ships there's no way to make any price-to-performance-based recommendations. Especially since it's not clear if the RTX 4080s will put any more downward pressure on RTX 3080 Ti prices as sellers really need to get rid of stock or if the 4090's price will drop as buyers balk at the price.

Big and bulky

Although much has been made of the RTX 4090's size the Founders Edition is at least smaller than the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti -- about an inch shorter. It's just as tall though (distance from PCI connector side to top) and I wish it were a bit less so. While it fits in my Corsair 4000D Airflow case -- just a midtower but still pretty wide at 9 inches -- a bit more space would give the quad-hydra power adapter coming off the top of the GPU a more comfortable bend where it hits the glass panel. And you can forget about your system's inner beauty. Time to get some PCIe 5 power cables so I don't have to use the Nvidia adapters.

The card is still big though: Slightly bigger than an Xbox Series S and definitely fatter than the RTX 3090 Ti FE. Somewhat more mind-boggling though is that the Founders Edition only has two fans and it's still a foot long. Third-party cards mostly have three (smaller) fans so they'll likely be even longer. It's quiet most of the time too though when you're pushing it you can hear the fans. I've heard worse though and at least they don't whine.

Nvidia's quad-headed adapter only requires three of the connections for sufficient power but if you want to overclock the card you'll need to hook up the fourth. Lori Grunin/CNET

But the FE is heavy probably because that heft includes a lot of heat-dissipating materials to make up for more fans. While it certainly requires three full slots even if it didn't that third slot's screw made me feel a lot more comfortable about relieving some potential stress on the PCI connector.

Plenty of room for vents on the triple-slot card. Lori Grunin/CNET

Nvidia has made a point of saying support for DLSS 3 is limited to the new Ada Lovelace-class GPUs at launch but post-launch it's likely it will extend to at least some RTX 30-series cards as well. But I don't expect it to deliver nearly as much improvement for the older GPUs simply because Ada has a lot of streamlining new algorithms and so on that generally lift performance before you even get to DLSS improvements. Similar to how the 30 series made a real jump over the 20 series for many things. (Here's a summary of all the updates the 40 series brings to the line.)

Fast 4K

There's a lot to unpack with respect to the RTX 4090 FE's performance relative to other cards and I don't have much of the comparative data yet -- I've just switched to a new GPU testbed and haven't completed a lot of my RTX 4090 testing or going back through older cards to retest.

I have tested enough to answer some of my most pressing questions though. For one even games that don't yet (or won't) support DLSS 3 get a notable boost in DLSS 2 performance in 4K. With DLSS 3 the CPU tends to run a little hotter and the GPU a little cooler compared to DLSS 2. You can get really good 4K performance without any performance-enhancing operations enabled (i.e. DLSS) and with everything ray-traceable and HDR maxed out at 4K you can play Cyberpunk 2077 pretty well with DLSS 3 (101 fps). Although there isn't a lot of improvement in minimum latency with DLSS 3 (which isn't surprising) it can significantly lower the maximum latency.

Its ray-tracing performance both on Port Royal and 3DMark DXR blew past everything else I've tested by a lot and the same goes for every test in the SpecViewPerf 2020 pro graphics suite. It seems to run pretty coolly but I haven't stressed it for an extended period yet.

I'll have my complete set of results ready by the time I've got an RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7000-series card for review. But I can say that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is a great card if you've got the room and the power supply for it. However if you care about the money and aren't desperate wait a month or two before committing.

What happened

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA 1.20%) were down 4.5% as of 1:15 p.m. ET on Monday following another analyst weighing in with a warning for investors.

Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay stood by an outperform rating on the stock with a near-term price target of $180. The analyst sees long-term growth for the company but in the near term he's concerned about mounting headwinds in semiconductors from a slowing PC market. This has sent Nvidia shares down 60% year to date.

So what

The U.S. government introduced new restrictions on chip exports today. The move is intended to keep China's military from using advanced computing technology produced by U.S. companies. Nvidia stands to lose $400 million in quarterly revenue. But that's just a small piece of Nvidia's problems right now.

The PC market has rapidly deteriorated in recent months. While Nvidia's advanced chips that are sold to data centers have held up well this year the gaming segment is most susceptible to weakness in the near term. Sales of gaming chips made up a third of Nvidia's business last quarter and fell 33% year over year.

However weakening demand in the consumer market might be carrying over to the data center segment. Nvidia's sales to hyperscale customers grew only 1% last quarter over the previous quarter. That's a significant slowdown from the fiscal-first-quarter's sequential growth of 15%.

Now what

Slowing demand for gaming chips has left Nvidia with excess inventory in the retail channel. This will likely lead to weak profitability through the end of the year as Nvidia clears channel inventory to make room for the new RTX 40 series graphics-processing units (GPUs) for gaming.

Investors should watch how management characterizes demand for the gaming and data center segments in the next earnings report. Nvidia may need to show stability across both of these segments before the stock can move higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmVhbHRhdmlsbGEvMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9udmlkaWFzLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAtYnJpbmdzLWJpZy1nYW1lLWJ1dC1pdC1jYW4tY3JlYXRlLWFuZC1jcnVuY2gtdG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 Brings Big Game But It Can Create And Crunch Too,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2022/10/11/nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-brings-big-game-but-it-can-create-and-crunch-too/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmVhbHRhdmlsbGEvMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9udmlkaWFzLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAtYnJpbmdzLWJpZy1nYW1lLWJ1dC1pdC1jYW4tY3JlYXRlLWFuZC1jcnVuY2gtdG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTQwOTAtcmV2aWV3LWdwdS11bmhvbHktYW1vdW50cy1wb3dlci0xMzAwMjA0MzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA RTX 4090 review: Unholy power,"How do you go about reviewing something like NVIDIA's RTX 4090? Just looking at its specs alone it's obviously the fastest consumer GPU we've ever seen. So sure I can tell you that I can play just about anything in 4K with ray tracing and every graphical nicety turned on. Hell it can even scale up to 8K if you're a masochist. For a $1599 video card it damn well better. But the real question is who is this thing actually for?

NVIDIA RTX 4090 NVIDIA RTX 4090 side view

Benching the RTX 4090 against NVIDIA and AMD's older hardware is practically pointless. Of course it's far faster. Of course it'll make you jealous. If you've got the cash and you're itching to upgrade go with God (or NVIDIA's leather-clad CEO Jensen Huang as the company's fans see him). But for anyone else who doesn't need bleeding edge hardware it exists purely as an object of lust. Sure you could wait for the upcoming RTX 4080 cards or whatever AMD has in the works but it's not a 4090. Just like the last generation of GPUs NVIDIA is throwing down the gauntlet with a power-hungry card for the most hardcore gamers and creators.

If your mind isn't made up I assume you're here just to see how much of a beast the 4090 is. And let me tell you it's a stunning thing to behold. Weighing in at 4.8 pounds and approaching the size of the PlayStation 5 the RTX 4090 is a triple-slot GPU that will dominate whatever case it’s in. Seriously if you're thinking of getting it be sure to measure your PC to ensure you can fit a nearly foot-long card that's close to 5 inches thick.

Devindra Hardawar/Engadget

Be prepared to upgrade your power supply too: The 4090 has a high 450W TDP (the same thermal design profile as the 3090 Ti) and it requires an 850W PSU. (Some third-party companies are pushing that demand to 1200W PSUs!) While it can be powered by a single PCIe 5.0 cable there still aren't many of those PSUs on the market so most people will likely end up using four 8-pin adapters. I cursed Jensen's name when I realized I needed to string another PSU line after tidying up all of my cables.

Beyond its obscene power demands though NVIDIA hasn't changed much about the 4090 Founder Edition's design from its previous model: It's still a high-end all-metal card with a massive vapor chamber heatsink array and two fans on opposite sides. NVIDIA claims they can push 20 percent more air than the 3090 Ti – in my testing that meant the 4090 stayed at a relatively cool 70C under load.

What's truly special about the RTX 4090 though is everything under the hood. It features the company's new ""Ada Lovelace"" architecture (named after the world's first computer programmer though I wonder if NVIDIA pays any royalties to turn her name into marketing). It has 16384 CUDA cores (almost 6000 more than the 3090 Ti) a base clock speed of 2.23GHz (boost to 2.52GHz) and 24GB of GDDR6X RAM. With figures like these the upcoming RTX 4080 cards (which start with 7680 CUDA cores) seem puny in comparison.

And really that seems like the point of dropping the 4090 before the rest of NVIDIA's new GPUs. It's like a heavenly body so massive it warps space time around it. This is the new standard. What other GPU can get you 135fps in Cyberpunk 2077 while playing in 4K with maxed out graphics and ray tracing?

To be clear though the 4090 isn't just about brute-force power. It was able to reach that killer Cyberpunk framerate by using DLSS 3 NVIDIA's latest AI upscaling technology that can now generate entire frames of imagery on its own. (That's in addition to upscaling lower resolution textures using AI like earlier versions.) DLSS 3 helped A Plague Tale Requiem perform more than twice as fast while running in 4K delivering around 175fps (up from 74fps).

None 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme Port Royal (Ray Tracing) Control Blender NVIDIA RTX 4090 16464 25405/117.62 fps 4K (Native) High RT: 107 fps 12335 NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti 8683 12948/59.95fps 4K (Native) 43fps Med RT 5940 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 7713 9104/42.15fps 4K (Native) No RT 28-40 N/A

The RTX 4090 had no trouble delivering 107 fps in Control while playing in 4K with high ray tracing settings. But you know what's even better? Getting a solid 128 fps when I flipped on an older version of DLSS. It's just unfortunate it doesn't support DLSS 3 yet because I'm sure it would eke out even better performance. Even though the game was actually being rendered in 1440p to my eye DLSS still does a stunning job of making that seem like 4K. (I tested the 4090 alongside Samsung's 55-inch Arc monitor giving me a much larger view than my typical 34-inch ultrawide screen. If there were graphical anomalies I would have seen them.)

I was particularly interested in stressing ray tracing performance on the 4090 because that was a feature that still managed to bring NVIDIA's 30-series cards to their knees. It enables more realistic lighting shadows and reflections. For most I'd wager the graphical facelift it delivers would be more impressive than a skyrocketing framerate count. So it's a wonder to see an NVIDIA card that can finally deliver 4K and solid ray tracing beyond 100fps. Is that worth $1599 though? That remains unclear especially since we don't know how the rest of the 40-series cards will compete.

Devindra Hardawar/Engadget

If you're looking for a video card that can do more than just game the 4090 may make more sense. In the Blender 3D rendering benchmark it scored twice as high as the RTX 3090 Ti a GPU released earlier this year for an eye-watering $1999. (Let's have a moment of silence for the poor souls who jumped on that card.) When it came to transcoding a short 4K clip into 1080p the RTX 4090 was also 10 seconds faster than the 3080 Ti. That could certainly add up if you're rendering longer clips episodes or feature films.

It's hard not to covet the RTX 4090 especially once you see what it's capable of. It's a glimpse into a world where we can finally get uncompromised ray tracing. But with the $899 and $1199 RTX 4080 cards on the horizon it’s tough to drop the price of an entire computer just to get the best frame rates in town There's just so much more to consider these days. You could pair up one of those 4080s with a Steam Deck for example and bring the joys of PC gaming on the road and all over your home. Sure you won't have the prestige of being in the 4090 club but you'll probably end up having more fun."

If you want to see some more of the biggest Dutch companies in the world go directly to 5 Most Valuable Dutch Companies in the World.

The Netherlands which is the land of the Dutch doesn't have a big economy. As of 2022 the country had a nominal GDP of slightly over $1 trillion and a population of 17.7 million.

The Dutch economy isn't projected to grow very fast either. According to the OECD the Dutch economy in June 2022 the Dutch economy is expected to grow 2.9% in 2022 and 1.1% in 2023. Inflation will also remain high averaging 9.2% before falling back to 4.8% in 2023 according to estimates. Although private consumption is expected to continue to support growth rising costs nevertheless could be a headwind for that growth.

Given the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased interest rates further since June and the central bank could do so in the future the Dutch economy could potentially slow more than expected. Rising U.S. interest rates could also affect demand and growth in other countries that trade with the United States.

Despite the Dutch economy not being the largest in the world the country does have two of the world's leading tech giants in ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Airbus. The country also includes many other smaller companies such as Exor that are also worth over $10 billion. Given that The Netherlands is based in the European Union many of the companies with headquarters there do business across the continent and in many cases globally as well.

For Europe the OECD said in June that it expects real GDP in the EA and EU to grow 2.6% in 2022 and 1.6% in 2023.

In terms of the global economy the IMF said in October that it expects 3.2% growth for 2022 and 2.9% for 2023. The IMF also said it estimates countries that make up 1/3 of the global economy to experience at minimum two consecutive quarters of economic contraction this year or next.

Given the current market volatility it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio across many different stocks across many different sectors.

In terms of the companies based in the Netherlands here are 15 of the most valuable in the world.

Artisan International Value Fund said the following about ING Groep N.V. (NYSE:ING) in its third quarter 2021 investor letter

“ING Groep is a Netherlands-based commercial bank. ING’s core operations are in Benelux and Germany but the bank also operates in several other European markets using primarily a fintech strategy. This is not new for ING. In fact the bank has been operating direct banking for decades. However the share price has suffered over the last few years along with other European banks’ share prices from increased regulation and financial suppression. This year ING is recovering like most banks from the COVID-related provisions charged to the P&L in 2020. But unlike other banks ING started 2021 with an overcapitalized balance sheet and a new CEO. Under CEO Steven van Rijswijk’s leadership ING has taken steps to exit poorly performing businesses—which will positively impact both profits and the bank’s capital position. In addition core profits are increasing and the company continues generating capital. During the quarter ING announced both a resumption of dividend payments and a new share repurchase program. The market is just waking up to this company’s quality and value. Even after the 12% share price increase during the quarter and the more than 66% increase year to date the shares still trade undeservedly below book value.""

Bengaluru-based ﻿Forus Health﻿ took 12 years to become profitable much of its earnings deriving from sales of its proprietary eye screening devices including among the world’s most advanced tools for detecting retinopathy in premature babies.





The company’s now projecting a 500% surge in revenue in five years as it turns its business model on its head focussing on services and platforms as it plots an aggressive expansion in the US.





Services and platforms deemed more investor-friendly currently contribute about 10% to Forus’s business. The company expects this to scale up to 70% in five years with key growth coming from the US a particularly tough terrain for domestic med-tech and biotech startups. A win there will be quite significant for the broader health-tech sector in India.





Forus is also planning its fifth fundraising round to drive this expansion. It has so far secured only about $18 million since it began operations in 2010. Founder-CEO K. Chandrasekhar didn’t disclose how much the company plans to raise now or Forus’s present and expected valuation only saying the company would continue to be conservative in fundraising.





But the angst is evident when Chandrasekhar talks about investments. “It gets frustrating sometimes when we hear somebody has raised $50 million or $200 million. Because although I have built a profitable tech-product business I am made to run around to raise even $2 million” he says. “We are given no respect.

It hurts (a bit).”

An inflection point

Forus’s plan for a big transformation rests on it becoming a digital platform and using artificial intelligence to reach millions of people globally says Chandrasekhar. As part of this the company plans investing at least $5 million for its US expansion over the next 2-3 years.





Forus first announced a subsidiary in the US in 2016 and has been focused on building a network there comprising eyecare specialists clinics and hospitals and other stakeholders.





“Forus is one of very few (domestic med-tech) companies with five US patents” says Sameer Wagle Managing Director at Asian HealthCare Fund which first invested in Forus in 2014. “They have been selling there for the last five years. And over the last 12-18 months they have been in discussions with strategics to do a more aggressive rollout in the US market.”





The size of the global ophthalmic devices market is estimated to be about $5 billion and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 5% till 2030 per company projections shared by Sameer. Of this the retinal imaging devices market accounts for about $2.06 billion and is expected to grow at 5.6% till 2030.





“Forus is at an inflection point” says Sameer highlighting what he terms as the company’s three levers of growth. “Its portfolio of devices will keep increasing but growth will also come from the two newer engines… The equipment sale will have steady growth and we’ll see some phenomenal growth coming from the services side and from the US market.”





Forus recorded a profit of Rs 18.71 lakh for the fiscal year 2021-22 swinging from a loss of Rs 1.09 crore in the year prior as revenue jumped 30% to Rs 28.11 crore. For FY 2023 the company expects revenue to leap to Rs 39.58 crore reaching Rs 168.7 crore by FY 2027.

Figuring the blind spot

Chandrasekhar an alumnus of BITS-Pilani and IIM-Calcutta was earlier a Director of Strategy at the Netherlands-headquartered NXP Semiconductors which was spun off from Philips in 2006. “I chose to study engineering because I was bad at biology” he says.





He began Forus (literally for us for Indians) for mass early intervention in preventable blindness following months of interactions with Dr S. Aravind presently Chief Medical Officer at Aravind Eye Hospital in Chennai.





The interactions were initially part of a Philips innovation initiative introducing its leaders to experts from other fields. But those continued even later as a side project with frequent weekend visits to Aravind Eye Hospital’s main facility in Madurai motivated in part by Chandrasekhar’s fondness for the city the centuries-old Meenakshi Amman Temple there and the famous Murugan idlis.





As Chandrasekhar met with doctors and importantly patients he understood some of the main hurdles to preventive eye care. Among those a reluctance to lose hours with the eyes dilated (which could deprive several of a day’s livelihood) and a dire shortage of ophthalmologists (one for every 70000 in India which hasn’t improved much since).





And that’s how Chandrasekhar decided to build a portable and rugged device that would allow for capturing images without dilation as well as enable remote diagnosis (the ‘cloud’ wasn’t a popular concept yet).

A global solution

Forus has developed several specialist eye screening devices since; its 3nethra neo HD FA is considered among the most advanced globally for neonatal retinal imaging.





Retinopathy of Prematurity or RoP is an eye disorder in babies born premature that can cause severe visual impairment and even blindness but is preventable with timely detection and treatment.





As it sold these devices primarily to retina specialists and ophthalmologists Forus also created an ecosystem of experts that it can now parlay for its services and platform play.





“That’s where I see maximum growth happening. When we go directly to the consumer the scope is much larger” says Chandrasekhar.





Globally at least 2.2 billion people are estimated to have near or distance vision impairment which could have been prevented or is yet to be addressed for about half of them according to the World Health Organization.





The annual global costs of productivity losses associated with uncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone are estimated at $244 billion and $25.4 billion WHO adds.





While several companies including global brands have started actively addressing this problem including with affordable solutions Forus still stands out.





“Forus played a significant role in creating this market (for affordable retina imaging devices)” says Dr Aravind over a phone call. “Globally they are playing a very important role. While (device) cost is not a barrier anymore where Forus has got an edge now is the network effect.”",,,

Thursday night they will be conducting a free work out at Eastwood High School for all fans wanting to attend.

The practice will be the first of its kind at a local high school for the UTEP men's basketball team. Fans will not only have an opportunity to get their first look at the all-new 2022-23 roster but they will also be able to meet Coach Golding and the Miners after the workout.

UTEP Athletics. UTEP Athletics. loading...

I love this concept for Coach Golding and his team and I have always believed that conducting special events at local high school gyms is a terrific way to bond the El Paso community with the Miners. I hope that becomes an annual event and UTEP will conduct similar workouts at other El Paso high schools.

In other news the Miners will play a pair of closed scrimmages later this month.

""The charts as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden suggest that Twitter  Valero and Occidental [Petroleum] could have some upside here. I'm more cautious on Twitter because it's an arbitrage play but the other two have my attention"" he said.

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday said that there are three stocks that could be set to rally.

The stock has made a pattern of reaching higher highs and higher lows which is a ""textbook sign of strength"" he said.

At the same time the key moving averages that Boroden watches look bullish. The stock is trading above both the 200-day and 50-day simple moving averages. In addition the 5-day exponential moving average is crossing over the 13-day according to Cramer.

""That's her favorite buy signal"" he said.

Cramer added that Boroden sees Twitter stock easily running to $53.43 or even $54.87. He acknowledged that Elon Musk's back-and-forth with Twitter on their deal for him to purchase the company at $54.20 a share could hurt the stock.

""I think our upside is capped at that level and if something goes wrong wow the stock will plummet through Boroden's support levels in the mid-to-high $40s at which point she says you need to go bearish because the bull thesis is toast"" he said.

Chinese drone company DJI opened the conference with a demo of their new dock solution that facilitates the launch of drones in remote locations. This new system which will be commercially available next year could have tremendous applications in the oil & gas sector. We were invited to attend the event.

DJI’s new dock solution intends to allow industrial players to run remote operations more easily. This programmable station enables a DJI Matrice 30 series to perform repeated waypoint flights in an automated way.

The 100 kg-Dock prepares the drone for launch and landing and makes sure flight conditions are safe. It also captures all the data and photos the drone will take during its operations. It also charges the batteries. You just have to fly the drone once show it the mission and then it will be able to repeat the same operation over and again.

The Dock is equipped with a security camera that gives visual reference a light and a weather station that sends temperature information and wind speeds. In case of heavy winds over 12 meters per second the Dock will not open and the drone won’t be able to take off. In case the drone is already on a mission and the wind suddenly becomes violent the drone will automatically land at a backup landing spot.

The Dock also has an RTK for a precise position landing and data capture. On the back side of the dock an air conditioning system is there for heating and cooling. It also enables the batteries to charge more quickly. 25 minutes are needed for the drone to be charged at 80%.

Grant Hostika Head of Solution Engineering for DJI in North America explained:

“The remote operator can plan monitor and execute missions from an office and then review data that is automatically uploaded after. He can see the planned mission on a screen and has a live feed of the drone. He can see what the camera is looking at. He has a live feed of the dock as well.”

DJI DJI

A remote controller can also be connected to the drone. It allows the operator to take over during a flight for example for safety purposes.

DJI has carried several proofs of concept with industrial companies and plans to add other features to the Dock next year such as manual flight control.

“There is also a third party cloud API which allows developers to add more features to the standard DJI software offering.”

And they are also looking at the possibility to have a payload on the drone which is on the Dock.

Applications

The Dock system removes the need to have a human operator holding a drone controller at the site. And as regulators increasingly approve autonomous flights beyond visual line of sight the oil & gas sector could be interested in deploying such a system to ease repeated inspection operations in remote locations.

The idea would be to install the station on top of a facility for better communication transmission. Then the operator can just be in a totally different location and follow in real time the launch flight and landing of the drone.

Energy company OXY (Occidental Petroleum) has tested the Dock in one of its training centers to inspect a tank battery. Dylan Allen UAS Supervisor at Oxy sees great potential for the industry :

“We pre-programmed 8 waypoint inspections and we had the drone take pictures of the signs on the tanks. You can program as many waypoints as you want. And you can always repeat that same route over and over again. And when you think about corrosion for example there are so many applications for the Dock for inspecting oil fields.”

Good Take-Off Location

The Dock however cannot be placed in any random location explained Grant Hostika:

” It’s important to survey the site that you put the Dock on. You need a good take off location for example on a rooftop. You need to think about the angle of obstruction close to the Dock. It must be in an open area with no buildings in front of it because if not it can be difficult to connect to satellites.”

If the Dock is intended to be stationed in a permanent way it can be put on a concrete pad for better stability.

In addition to the oil sector the Dock could prove useful for rail inspections over hundreds of kilometers. However it needs to be connected to an electric outlet which makes it impossible to use in the middle of nowhere. But according to Adam Lisberg DJI Corporate Communication Director

“We are working on this. Solar panels could be a solution and then using Starlink satellites for Internet connection.”

The Dock will be commercially available in the second quarter of 2023. Its price will be around 35000 USD. However due to the increase in the price of some components this price could change at the time of launch next year.

That might not seem like a lot but if its prediction comes true it would be the second-largest decline in housing prices since the Great Depression.

That's not going to be good for the stock market. Here's why.

The average family has two household finance buckets: income and spending. Money comes into the income bucket from your job freelance gig small business and passive investments such as stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

That income goes out to pay all of your fixed and variable expenses. The mortgage or rent check is the biggest fixed expense for most American households. Whether you rent or own housing affordability is near or at all-time lows leaving little for other savings-related initiatives such as your retirement plan.

""Affordability is already challenged exposing would-be homeowners to an increasing rent environment that erodes their ability to save for a down payment. If that were to be combined with increasing unemployment we could imagine a scenario in which existing home sales continue to outpace the GFC to the downside"" Fortune contributor Lance Lambert reported recent comments from Morgan Stanley researchers.

If you're renting and interested in buying a house the upside of falling prices is that you're going to be able to find your dream home for less. The downside of falling home prices is that your carrying costs will be higher due to increased mortgage rates.

So for the renter the savings are fleeting.

For the mortgage-free homeowner who doesn't plan on moving their circumstances won't change much. However the household that's been considering refinancing won't be nearly as enthusiastic about the process today as they were a year ago.

We know this from current mortgage refinancing activity.

According to the Mortgage Bankers Association's Refinance Index refinance applications fell by 18% for the week ending Sept. 30 2022 compared to the previous week. Meanwhile applications were down 86% from the same week a year ago. They've all but dried up.

Whether you're a renter or a homeowner now is not a good time to be making long-term decisions.

Home Prices and the Stock Market

As for stock markets the current environment of rising interest rates falling home prices and high inflation is a triple whammy because it makes it that much harder for the average saver to come up with funds to invest.

Empirically it's been shown that home prices do influence stock prices.

The obvious example would be the Great Recession which officially lasted 19 months from December 2007 to June 2009.

According to Federal Reserve data U.S. household wealth fell by approximately $16.4 trillion from the first quarter of 2007 ($65.8 trillion) to the first-quarter of 2009 ($49.4 trillion). Two years after the official end of the recession Americans had barely regained 50% of their lost wealth.

At the same time real estate values fell by almost 30% from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2010 while the S&P 500 declined by 12% over that same time frame.

While no one is predicting that home prices will fall anywhere near 30% this time around it's important for investors to realize that indexes such as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average aren't likely to reverse course in the near term.

So if you're thinking of buying stocks in the fourth quarter the data suggests the odds of success are stacked against you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8xMS8yNTMxMzg2LzAvZW4vU3dpbW1pbmctUG9vbC1DaGVtaWNhbHMtTWFya2V0LVNpemUtV2lsbC1BdHRhaW4tVVNELTUtMjU0LU1pbGxpb24tYnktMjAzMC1ncm93aW5nLWF0LTMtNS1DQUdSLUV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1SZXBvcnQtYnktQWN1bWVuLVJlc2VhcmNoLWFuZC1Db25zdWx0aW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swimming Pool Chemicals Market Size Will Attain USD 5254,"BEIJING Oct. 10 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Global Swimming Pool Chemicals Market Size accounted for USD 3905 Million in 2021 and is projected to achieve a market size of USD 5254 Million by 2030 rising at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2022 to 2030.

The S&P 500 fell 0.7% extending its losing streak to a fourth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3% after wavering between small gains and losses and the Nasdaq composite fell 1%. The Dow and Nasdaq have also closed lower the past four trading days.

Small company stocks also fell dragging the Russell 2000 index 0.6% lower. U.S. bond trading was closed.

Major indexes are coming off a volatile week where they notched out gains because of an early two-day rally that shielded stocks from several weak days.

Wall Street has been turbulent amid worries about stubbornly hot inflation and the Federal Reserve’s plan to tame high prices by raising interest rates. The goal is to slow economic growth and cool both borrowing and spending in order to get inflation under control but the plan risks sending the economy into a recession.

Investors will potentially get a more detailed picture of the Fed’s thinking on Wednesday when the central bank releases minutes from its latest policy meeting. That’s when the Fed made another extra-big interest rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point.

“Nobody’s arguing about whether inflation is falling it’s simply the slope of the slide” said David Kelly chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “The inflation battle is being won and the problem is the recession battle may be getting lost unnecessarily.”

Wall Street will also get important updates on inflation and more insight into how that is impacting retail sales.

The government on Wednesday will release its report on producer prices which will provide details for inflation on the wholesale level for businesses. The closely watched report on consumer prices will be released on Thursday and a report on retail sales will be released on Friday.

The latest sales update could confirm that consumers are increasingly stretched financially or at least pulling back on spending. That could send a signal to the Fed Kelly said.

“I’m just hoping the Fed is watching these indicators” he said. “It should tell them they’re much closer to both beating inflation and killing the economy than they think they are.”

Uncertainty about how the economy will weather future Fed rate hikes has helped keep trading choppy on Wall Street. The major indexes were all briefly in the green Monday before ending up in the red by the end of the day.

The S&P 500 fell 27.27 points to 3612.39. The Dow dropped 93.91 points to close at 29202.88. The Nasdaq lost 110.30 points to 10542.10. The Russell 2000 fell 10.23 points to 1691.92.

Technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Makers of semiconductors and chip manufacturing equipment also suffered heavy selling after the U.S. government tightened export controls to limit China’s ability to get advanced computing chips develop and maintain supercomputers and make advanced semiconductors. Nvidia fell 3.4%.

Energy stocks fell as the price of U.S. crude oil dropped 1.6%. Occidental Petroleum slid 5.6%.

Health care stocks also helped pull the S&P 500 lower. Pfizer lost 1.4%.

Industrial companies and others considered less risky such as household goods makers held up better than the rest of the market.

A busy week of closely watched economic reports comes amid the opening to the latest round of corporate earnings reports. Those reports and statements from companies and corporate executives could help provide a clearer picture of how high prices are impacting revenue and profits and the expectations for the rest of the year and even into 2023.

PepsiCo Delta Air Lines and Walgreens are among the big companies reporting earnings this week. Several major banks will report their results on Friday including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.

Inflation and recession risks remain at the top of the list for big concerns but COVID-19 and its potential to worsen already slowing economic growth continues to linger. Stocks fell in Hong Kong and Shanghai on news of more lockdowns in China due to rising COVID-19 cases. Markets in Tokyo were closed for a holiday.

Casino and resort operators with operations in China slumped over worries about the impact from more lockdowns. Wynn Resorts fell 12.2% for the biggest decline among S&P 500 companies and Las Vegas Sands slid 7.6%."

Last year marked the 50th anniversary of Tidewater Virginia’s grandest indoor venue for live events.

The Scope opened in November 1971 three years after construction began on the 11000-seat venue and accompanying 2500-seat concert space known as Chrysler Hall. Renowned Italian architect Pier Liugi best known for the modernist buildings he created for the 1960 Rome Summer Olympics brought his unique design sensibilities to the Scope.

The arena was named for the wide range of human endeavors its boosters planned to bring to the venue. The Scope has proven to be the magnet for fantastic live events that its founders had envisioned—everything from professional sports to college games to professional wrestling to rock concerts and religious revivals.

It has been a particularly esteemed venue for big time college basketball. Here are 10 of the greatest moments in the basketball history of the Norfolk Scope:

10. Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Men’s Basketball Tournament 1979-1985 1988-1990:

The Scope served as the home of the CIAA’s hotly contested conference basketball tournament for much of the 80s. Featuring teams primarily from the Mid-Atlantic the CIAA is an NCAA Division II conference which consists of historically black colleges. The most noteworthy NBA player to come through the CIAA tournament during this period was Virginia Union’s Charles Oakley who was tournament co-MVP in 1985.

9. Norfolk State 122 Old Dominion 119 (OT) December 9 1971:

Until Old Dominion jumped to Division I in 1977 the ODU-Norfolk State men’s basketball rivalry was one of the hottest tickets in Division II. These perennial powers battled for regional dominance for years frequently spoiling one another’s shot at a national title in the 1960s and early 1970s. Quite fittingly the first college basketball game at the Scope was a 122-119 overtime barnburner between the ancient Tidewater rivals played before a packed house. Norfolk State had the last laugh that afternoon but four years later Sonny Allen’s ODU club earned a degree of immortality for their basketball program winning a Division II national title.

8. Old Dominion Lady Monarchs Women’s Basketball 1980-Present:

The Lady Monarchs are one of women’s college basketball’s most iconic programs: 25 NCAA Tournament appearances three Final Fours and a national championship in 1985. They boast a 9-4 record in their 13 appearances at the Scope.

7. Old Dominion Wins ECAC South Men’s Basketball Tournament March 4-6 1982:

The Monarchs men’s basketball team made the Scope their big game home between 1971 and 2002. All told ODU compiled a 208-87 record at the Scope. Three of their most exciting wins at the Scope came on the weekend of March 4-6 1982 when the Paul Webb-coached Monarchs squad earned its second-ever bid to the Division I NCAA Tournament by defeating George Mason Richmond and James Madison on successive days.

6. Villanova 71 Old Dominion 68 March 9 1977:

In their first season in Division I ECAC South champions Old Dominion hosted its first ever National Invitation Tournament (NIT) game. The Monarchs dropped a back-and-forth battle with Rollie Massimino’s Villanova Wildcats.

5. The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) Men’s Basketball Tournament 1991-1993 2013-Present:

Every March the 11-member MEAC a Division I conference which consists of historically black colleges and universities holds its men’s basketball tournament at the Scope. In recent years the tourney has been dominated by North Carolina Central and Hampton who combined to win six straight titles from 2014-2019.

4. Julius Erving Debuts for the Virginia Squires (American Basketball Association) 1971-1972:

Julius “Dr. J.” Erving spent the first two years of his professional career (1971-1973) wowing crowds at the Scope. Erving was the signature player for the Virginia Squires (1970-1976) of the American Basketball Association (ABA) arguably the most exciting and most mythologized league in sports history. Erving brought his unprecedented above-the-rim action to the Tidewater making the Scope home to some of the most ferocious slam dunks in basketball history. In 1972 Erving the rookie sensation led the Squires to the Eastern Division Finals averaging more than 30 points and 20 rebounds per game. The Squires swept he Miami Floridians in the semifinals before losing a dramatic seven-game series to the New York Nets.

3. Soviet Union 76 Old Dominion 66 December 13 1979 (Women’s Basketball):

More than 10000 fans packed the Scope the largest crowd in ODU history to see a women’s basketball game to see the Lady Monarchs take on the Soviet National Women’s Basketball Team a team that had not lost in 21 years. Led by the legendary Nancy Lieberman the Lady Monarchs hung tough against the Soviets holding a 34-32 advantage at the half. The 76-66 final score was a remarkable showing against the Soviets especially when one considers that their 7-foot-2-inch center Ulyana Semenyova stood a foot taller than anyone on the ODU roster.

2. Old Dominion 76 Soviet Union 74 (OT) November 19 1979:

In a precursor to the U.S. Olympic Hockey Team’s February 1980 “Miracle on Ice” ODU’s men’s basketball team overcame an 11-point deficit with less than 10 minutes remaining to defeat the Soviet national team 76-74 in overtime.

1. ABA All-Star Game January 30 1974:

The ABA put on one heck of a show with its red white and blue ball at the Scope in January 1974. Basketball legends such as George McGinnis Artis Gilmore Dan Issel George Gervin and Julius Erving dazzled the 10000-plus fans in attendance that evening. The East team brought home a 128-112 victory. Kentucky Colonels 7-foot-4-inch center Artis Gilmore who played for the East earned MVP honors.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year for long enough its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.

If this kind of company isn't your style you like companies that generate revenue and even earn profits then you may well be interested in Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Old Dominion Freight Line with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.

Old Dominion Freight Line's Earnings Per Share Are Growing

Generally companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Old Dominion Freight Line has managed to grow EPS by 28% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.

It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins as well as revenue growth to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Old Dominion Freight Line is growing revenues and EBIT margins improved by 2.6 percentage points to 28% over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.

Fortunately we've got access to analyst forecasts of Old Dominion Freight Line's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.

Are Old Dominion Freight Line Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Since Old Dominion Freight Line has a market capitalisation of US$30b we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it currently valued at US$3.0b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success or failure with the stock.

It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Old Dominion Freight Line with market caps over US$8.0b is about US$13m.

The Old Dominion Freight Line CEO received US$11m in compensation for the year ending December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed modest remuneration is a positive because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance more generally.

Does Old Dominion Freight Line Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?

You can't deny that Old Dominion Freight Line has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. The overarching message here is that Old Dominion Freight Line has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. You still need to take note of risks for example - Old Dominion Freight Line has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.

Being open about my mental health struggles has made me a better leader. If working from home is here to stay no one should have to pretend to their colleagues that our private lives are perfect.

That time of the year is here again… and no I’m not thinking of Halloween but something far more important — World Mental Health Day. And what strange conditions we find ourselves in having jumped from one crisis to the next for three years running.

It hasn’t been entirely negative though. The new hybrid working model that has emerged post-pandemic gives us more control and flexibility over our work commitments than ever before. On the other hand it’s become much harder to create a strong and cohesive work culture. With one big exception…

Covid was highly successful in making our working lives less formal. Like it or not we’ve all invited our colleagues and clients into our homes via video calls. For the most fortunate that’s been into the home office for others the kitchen or even their bedroom — washing baskets and all. We’ve become very accustomed to seeing people’s real and authentic ‘home’ selves rather than the version they inhabit at work.

It’s hard to maintain an air of slick professionalism when we’ve attended informal meetings in our pyjamas or comforted a crying baby during a client call. For me this has been liberating.

I know from personal experience just how difficult and damaging maintaining a work persona can be. Back in 2017 I suffered from burnout and had to take some time away from work to recover. I’ve now had five years to reflect on that time in my life and I’ve recognised that one of the big stresses I was facing was juggling multiple personas.

Enough was enough

I’ve also seen this in my daughter’s autism. She ‘masks’ it when she’s with people she doesn’t feel comfortable with this takes up a lot of her energy and usually results in a meltdown once she’s safely back home.

To a certain extent this is what happened to me five years ago.

At that time I was maintaining a father persona a husband persona a work persona and a friend persona. Each was a subtle variation on a theme but none was quite truly ‘me’.

It was exhausting.

Eventually my mind (and body!) just said ‘enough is enough’. Working from home during Covid was a huge help in getting over these bad habits. Actually it really wasn’t a huge effort to stop hiding my true self dropping the mask is much easier than putting it on.

And doing so doesn’t need any grand gestures. For instance you can learn a lot about someone just from the backdrop to video calls — and my twin loves of Lego and Star Wars certainly couldn’t be hidden and nor should they! I’ve since had lots of questions positive comments and more geeky discussions about Lego and/or Star Wars on Teams calls than I care to count. And it’s been great!

Bring more humanity to work relationships

I never tried to hide my burnout and admitting you’re vulnerable actually takes a lot of courage. I am human I am fallible I’m a Star Wars fan and that’s ok.

One thing I’m sure of is being open about my mental health struggles has made me a better leader. Relatability matters it encourages colleagues to be more authentic and open at work happier teams means less office politics less churn and ultimately gives people the headspace to focus on producing great work.

A lot has already been written about the importance of bringing ‘our authentic selves to work’ and it’s never been easier to do that than now. My concern is that as many of us spend more and more time back in the office we will let ourselves slip back into old habits. And that would be a huge step backwards.

While we can’t ever be thankful of Covid it has forced some changes that have ultimately been for the better. Humanising our working relationships and bringing greater balance to our home and work lives has had hugely positive impacts on our job satisfaction and mental wellbeing.

So let’s throw out those bland video call backgrounds welcome our colleagues into our homes and bring our same messy nerdy unashamed self into work. It’s done wonders for me and I’m sure it will do wonders for you too.

Global head of gaming partnerships Twitter

Twitter often serves as a second screen for live sports which has made the platform attuned to supporting esports and gaming. There were over 1.5 billion tweets about gaming in the first half of 2022 alone.

In his five years at Twitter Rishi Chadha the platform’s global head of gaming partnerships has helped forge several partnerships within the gaming community. For instance since 2018 Twitter has worked with Riot Games the maker of popular titles Valorant and League of Legends and Activision Blizzard the company behind Call of Duty. This year Riot Games made custom Twitter banners for esports fans and Activision Blizzard made a watch guide of Twitter-exclusive content to keep fans up to date on Call of Duty league news. Twitter also hosts “Visionaries” a podcast by esports journalist Jacob Wolf in Twitter Spaces as well as Spaces related to Overwatch League.

“I think there has been this notion that brands need to ‘be authentic’ or find a 1:1 match in order to successfully enter into the gaming space and while I agree with these guidelines to some extent I would actually go as far as saying that brands looking to break into the gaming industry should first identify a credible partner or multiple that they want to work with” Chadha wrote in an email. “From there organizations breaking into the space can let their partner(s) manage the creative process for them. Partners could be a game publisher an esports league or even individual gaming personalities but the important lesson here is to let them tell your stories in their own creative way so that you can borrow their equity to establish yourself in the space.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcG9zdC5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2FydGljbGUvMzc4NTI3L25mdC1wcm9qZWN0LXN1cHBvcnRzLWhvbWVsZXNzLWluLXNhbi1mcmFuY2lzY28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFT Project Supports Homeless In San Francisco 10/10/2022,"by Steve McClellan @mp_mcclellan October 7 2022

Just as New York City has declared a state of emergency in repsonse to the influx of tens of thousands of migrants from Latin America this year a new effort in San Francisco was unveiled today to help the many homeless there.

It's called the Cryptoless Project and was developed by photographer Antoine Guéne and the non-profit City Team with support from creative agency OK C'est Cool. Blockchain devolopment studio BlockLabs42 and the artist KAO are also contributing resources.

The main idea: to sell NFTs to raise money for City Team in support of its work. Most of the proceeds will go to that group although 20% is being earmarked to expand the effot to other cities and causes.

advertisement advertisement Available on the website cryptoless.art the first collection comprises 600 NFTs generated from 10 portraits of homeless people living in San Francisco. The analog pictures take place in the streets of the Tenderloin district a neighborhood knonw for widespread homelessness and other problems like drug abuse.

In the pictures the homeless carry a sign with the acronym WAGMI--We are All Going to Make It. It is a well-known cryptocurrency and NFT expression but in that world refers to making money. According to campaign organiizors the expression's use in the campaign is designed to spread a message of hope.

The campaign is tied to World Homeless Day October 10 when a social media campaign will kick off with NFT and cryptocurrency influencers and Web3 Media.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpemNvbW11bml0eS5jb20vQXJ0aWNsZS8xOTYvMTIvMjMyMzY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The significance of 17 for dentsu - Dentsu,"17 signifies self-discipline compassion responsibility awareness and wisdom and depicts perfectly how the dentsu brands work with our clients and their brands across sub-Saharan Africa. 17 is also the number of finalists we attained at this year's Loeries.

It shows once again how the United States is under increasing pressure to stay ahead of China’s efforts to expand its semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on Taiwan as the sole supplier of advanced electronics essential to US military and commercial needs. The Biden administration’s new export controls come on the heels of Congress approving billions of dollars to support cutting-edge chips manufacturing. However money alone will not guarantee the success of the US-based semiconductor industry. US firms should also glean critical lessons from successful incumbents in allied and partner countries like South Korea and Taiwan.

China’s recent breakthrough in producing semiconductors using seven nanometer (nm) process technology—a level of production prowess that has eluded the top US chip maker Intel Corporation—underlined the need for US government support to ensure domestic chip makers maintain the capacity to produce the most sophisticated semiconductors. The CHIPS and Science Act allocates fifty-two billion dollars in subsidies and tax relief to support chip manufacturing along with another two hundred billion dollars dedicated to research and other investments. The law is intended to provide subsidies and other assistance to Intel and other US semiconductor makers as they ramp up capital investment in manufacturing facilities. The funding also will benefit the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Corporation as they build chip factories in Arizona and Texas respectively.

These recent developments highlight the challenge of duplicating the exacting production standards of East Asian chip makers whose factories are central to globe-spanning semiconductor supply chains. The United States is seeking to catch up with the capabilities of established industry leaders in Taiwan and South Korea while also striving to stay ahead of China’s efforts to develop semiconductor self-sufficiency. Beijing is devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to this effort one that most recently bore fruit when its leading chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) managed to produce the seven nm chips—which only TSMC and Samsung had been capable of manufacturing—despite strict US controls on sales of key chip-making technology to Chinese companies.

There is an important strategic dimension to this competition that transcends the race for technological breakthroughs. Some analysts have raised concerns about whether China would invade Taiwan in order to seize its prized semiconductor industry including TSMC’s most advanced factories. However this is not an immediately realistic prospect for a number of reasons including that such an attack would likely end up destroying Taiwan’s factories and scattering the industry’s greatest resource—its deeply experienced engineers and technicians—around the globe. Not to mention the disastrous impact that this outcome would have on the global economy especially for an industry that is based on a tightly integrated supply chain that includes Japanese American Dutch South Korean Chinese and Taiwanese suppliers.

Moreover the invasion scenario gives short shrift to the mutual dependence that has built up between the Taiwanese and Chinese economies over the past four decades largely because of the bonds created by trade in semiconductors. This interdependence has created what the Taiwanese populace often refers to as the “silicon shield.”

But the threat to Taiwan’s industry—and the vulnerability of semiconductor supply chains—has also given pause to US politicians and industry executives contributing to an increased policy focus on ramping up American chip-making capabilities. The United States currently accounts for 12 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing down from 37 percent in 1990. TSMC meanwhile produces over 90 percent of the most advanced chips and will soon begin commercial production on a three nm “node” or production line. If successfully commercialized chips produced from this node would be the world’s smallest.

The technical hurdles to duplicating the Taiwanese and South Korean success stories are daunting. State-of-the-art chip foundries cost more than ten billion dollars. Even once they are built achieving mass production of flawless devices is no easy task. Witness the difficulties Intel has faced in recent years while trying to advance its production to the point where it can make seven nm semiconductors. Currently Intel’s leading chips are produced under contract in its Asian competitors’ factories. Furthermore the production process requires hundreds of sophisticated inputs and devices procured around the world none more important than the $340 million machines produced only by the Dutch company ASML Holding that etch circuitry using extreme ultraviolet lithography.

But producing the most advanced chips involves much more than simply mastering the technology. The real challenge lies in attaining high yields of flawless chips in factories that produce millions of semiconductors. Imagine finding a flaw caused by a random light particle that is virtually too small to detect on electronic circuits separated by only a few billionths of a meter. The more densely packed circuits are within a chip the harder it is to attain the level of perfection necessary to provide chip makers with their profit margins.

TSMC has become renowned for achieving up to 95 percent yields at its factories—meaning nineteen out of twenty chips are perfect. After four decades of developing and perfecting groundbreaking chip technology the Taiwanese company has more experienced engineers and technicians and a greater understanding of the demands facing an intensely automated industry than any other company. This reflects a corporate culture that molds a workforce of thousands of technicians willing to execute the demanding work required to ensure high yields.

Such success also requires an educational system like Taiwan’s that can provide the basic training in electrical engineering to continuously churn out new technicians who will staff the dozens of chip factories operated by TSMC and the country’s other chip makers. The recently approved US legislation recognizes the importance of a trained workforce in building a revitalized semiconductor industry and thus calls for increased funding of university programs centered around new chip-making hubs.

The United States can also learn much from leading companies like TSMC and Samsung at the factory level. For instance US factories should incorporate high-volume manufacturing material procurement quality control machine-learning feedback troubleshooting and cost containment into their semiconductor production lines. In essence these companies stay at the top of their game by running research and development twenty-four hours a day.

There is some concern in Taiwan that TSMC’s investments in the United States will weaken the company at home. But the reality is that the growth of competition will continue to generate innovation strengthening the semiconductor industry in Taiwan and benefiting all countries.

Ultimately the best source of skills and experience for the US semiconductor industry will come from the industry’s Asian leaders particularly as TSMC and Samsung seek to expand their manufacturing bases in the United States. Their presence on US soil—along with the suppliers and subcontractors that will move to their new base of operations—will foster an ecosystem that will fuel the efficient development of a semiconductor industry that can bolster US national security. US legislation such as the CHIPS and Science Act can support this process and as know-how spreads to Intel and other US companies the integration of semiconductor supply chains across the Pacific will enhance the ability of democratic countries to maintain a competitive advantage against China and strengthen the backbone of the Indo-Pacific partnership.

On October 7 2022 the Biden administration announced a new export controls policy on artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor technologies to China. These new controls—a genuine landmark in U.S.-China relations—provide the complete picture after a partial disclosure in early September generated confusion. For weeks the Biden administration has been receiving criticism in many quarters for a new round of semiconductor export control restrictions first disclosed on September 1. The restrictions block leading U.S. AI computer chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD from selling their high-end chips for AI and supercomputing to China. The criticism typically goes like this:

China’s domestic AI chip design companies could not win customers in China because their chip designs could not compete with Nvidia and AMD on performance.

Chinese firms could not catch up to Nvidia and AMD on performance because they did not have enough customers to benefit from economies of scale and network effects.

Because of the new export controls revenues that formerly flowed to U.S. chip companies will now go to Chinese chip companies offering a viable path to economies of scale and competitive performance.

In the short term this policy will significantly harm Chinese AI data center companies.

However blocking U.S. AI chip designers from selling their world-leading chips is actually good for China in the longer term because it will strengthen China’s domestic chip design ecosystem.

While the reasoning in this criticism is sound it does not imply that the Biden administration’s actions are self-defeating. Rather it shows how the policy as disclosed in September was incomplete. A policy like this would not make sense if that is the only step the administration planned to take. Clearly something was missing and industry experts have been waiting for the other shoe to drop ever since.

On October 7 the other shoe dropped. The Biden administration announced a massive policy shift on semiconductor exports to China as well as revised rules for how the lists of restricted parties are managed. In recent decades U.S. semiconductor policy has been primarily market driven and laissez faire. With the new policy which comes on the heels of the CHIPS Act’s passage the United States is firmly focused on retaining control over so-called “chokepoint” (or as it is sometimes translated from Chinese “stranglehold”) technologies in the global semiconductor technology supply chain.

The most important chokepoints in the context of this discussion are AI chip designs electronic design automation software semiconductor manufacturing equipment and equipment components. The Biden administration’s latest actions simultaneously exploit U.S. dominance across all four of these chokepoints. In doing so these actions demonstrate an unprecedented degree of U.S. government intervention to not only preserve chokepoint control but also begin a new U.S. policy of actively strangling large segments of the Chinese technology industry—strangling with an intent to kill.

The Biden Administration’s Four Semiconductor Policy Chokeholds

There are four interlocking elements of the new policy targeting different segments of the semiconductor value chain and all elements must be understood simultaneously to grasp the scope of what the Biden administration plans on achieving. In short the Biden administration is trying to (1) strangle the Chinese AI industry by choking off access to high-end AI chips; (2) block China from designing AI chips domestically by choking off China’s access to U.S.-made chip design software; (3) block China from manufacturing advanced chips by choking off access to U.S.-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and (4) block China from domestically producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment by choking off access to U.S.-built components.

These actions demonstrate an unprecedented degree of U.S. government intervention to not only preserve chokepoint control but also begin a new U.S. policy of actively strangling large segments of the Chinese technology industry—strangling with an intent to kill.

Strangle the Chinese AI and supercomputing industries by choking off access to high-end chips.

The highest levels of leadership in both the United States and China—including Chinese president Xi Jinping—believe that leading in AI technology is critical to the future of global military and economic power competition. China is a global leader in AI research AI commercialization and AI-enabled military technology. China’s strategy of “military-civil fusion” is designed to ensure that the best Chinese commercial AI technology is always available to the military and that the military’s linkages to China’s commercial industry are deeply interwoven. As a result of military-civil fusion U.S. sanctions and export controls cannot effectively target China’s military (which the United States has historically been very willing to do) without also targeting Chinese commercial industry (which the United States has historically been more reluctant to do).

To date targeted U.S. efforts to allow commercial Chinese access to high-end chips while blocking military access have had weak results. For example in 2015 the Obama administration blocked U.S. chipmaker Intel from selling its high-end Xeon chips to Chinese military supercomputer research centers such as the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). While this policy ended direct sales from U.S. companies to the Chinese military it was completely ineffective at stopping indirect sales to the shell companies that helped the Chinese military evade export controls. China’s NUDT has not only built new globally leading supercomputers after the restrictions went into effect but those new supercomputers still use the latest and greatest (and banned) Intel Xeon chips. More broadly examinations of Chinese military equipment of all types have found them to be extremely reliant on U.S. chips.

For high-end AI and supercomputing chips the Biden administration has essentially given up on trying to thread the needle between refusing to let U.S. technology help China’s military while promoting U.S.-China commercial trade. High-end AI chips can no longer be sold to any entity operating in China whether that is the Chinese military a Chinese tech company or even a U.S. company operating a data center in China. The Biden administration is essentially saying to China: “If your policy is military-civil fusion then the only realistic way of implementing our policy of no military end use is to end all sales to China and we are now willing to take that step.”

It took a long time for the United States to get here. After decades of ratcheting Chinese government provocations—including state-sponsored corporate espionage forced technology transfer market access restrictions export control violations human rights atrocities in Xinjiang undermining democracy in Hong Kong the deployment of AI-enabled surveillance megaprojects and the development of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons—the Biden administration is saying “enough is enough.” This is not a policy of decoupling (yet) but it is proof of the United States’ unwillingness to remain tightly coupled to the Chinese technology sector under previous conditions.

Earlier reporting based on official Department of Commerce letters sent to Nvidia and AMD assumed that the export control restrictions applied only to those companies and their current model of high-end AI chips. In reality the rules set a performance threshold for what sorts of chips can be sold to China and everything above the performance threshold requires the seller to seek an export license from the Department of Commerce. However policymakers have told all sellers that license applications for sales of such chips to China will face “a presumption of denial.” Thus this new policy is de jure a new license requirement but de facto a ban. Because the United States is broadly invoking the foreign-direct product rule this export license requirement applies not only to Nvidia and AMD but to any would-be competitors around the world.

The performance threshold requires two conditions to be met. The chip must be both a very powerful parallel processor (300 tera operations per second or higher) and have a very fast interconnect speed (600 gigabytes per second or higher). By only targeting chips with very high interconnect speeds the White House is attempting to limit the controls to chips that are designed to be networked together in the data centers or supercomputing facilities that train and run large AI models. China will still be able to buy massively parallel computer chips that are optimized to work in individual computers such as those that are included in video game consoles.

At present Nvidia and AMD are among a small set of chip designers in the world with sufficiently advanced technology to make chips in this category but there are Chinese firms that are not far off. However in the case of Nvidia its competitive dominance is based not only on the performance of its chips but also on the strength of the software ecosystem that is based upon Nvidia standards particularly Nvidia’s CUDA software ecosystem. CUDA makes it much easier for programmers to write massively parallelized software (as all modern AI software is) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa. Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers. Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers.

The strength of the combined offering of CUDA software and Nvidia hardware goes a long way toward explaining why Nvidia accounts for 95 percent of AI chip sales in China according to Fubon Securities Investment Services estimates.

This explains in part why the AI chip restrictions revealed in early September were so damaging to Nvidia’s stock price. Stock markets spent a full month looking only at the first part of the government’s actions—blocking Nvidia’s sales. Lacking the full policy picture Nvidia investors saw not only lost revenue to China but a massive incentive for Chinese AI companies (or any non-U.S. entity looking to sell to China) to band together and build an alternative ecosystem to CUDA one that potentially could harm Nvidia sales not only in China but around the world.

However Biden administration officials foresaw this risk in the plan leading to the second chokehold of the policy.

Block China from designing AI chips domestically by choking off its access to U.S.-made chip design software and U.S.-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Nvidia’s CUDA is not the only part of the global semiconductor supply chain where the United States enjoys a dominant position based on advantages in software. Modern chips can fit tens of billions of transistors on every square inch of silicon. The software that enables chip designers to create the astonishingly complicated blueprints for such chips is called electronic design automation (EDA). In the case of semiconductor EDA there are three leading companies in the market: Mentor Graphics Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys. All three are headquartered in and have the bulk of their staff in the United States (though Mentor is actually a subsidiary of Europe’s Siemens). America’s dominance of the EDA software market is another chokepoint being used to strangle China in this case to strangle the Chinese chip design industry.

Even before the new policy any one of the roughly 28 Chinese chip design and supercomputing organizations on the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) “parties of concern” lists was subject to a presumption of denial for the purchase of U.S. semiconductor design software or for the export of any designs that were made using the software. However the new policy adds powerful new tools to enforce that: in the event that Chinese companies continue to use U.S.-designed software that was either illegally pirated or legally purchased before the ban went into effect Chinese chip designers will be unable to have their chip designs manufactured outside of China. That is a significant disadvantage because Chinese semiconductor manufacturing companies are significantly less technologically advanced than others elsewhere in the world.

By invoking the foreign direct product rule the United States is prohibiting any semiconductor manufacturing company worldwide from providing services to any Chinese chip design company that is seeking to make high-end chips for AI or supercomputing. The Foreign Direct Product Rule offers two hooks to block Chinese chip design companies from having their chips manufactured: on the EDA software and again on the U.S.-built equipment that is an irreplaceable (at least for now) part of every semiconductor manufacturing operation anywhere in the world. Any chip manufacturing operation—whether Chinese or otherwise—that seeks to build Chinese chip designs will risk losing its own access to U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment. With the new rules no Chinese chip design company will be allowed to outsource manufacturing abroad for advanced AI and supercomputing chips. For those Chinese organizations on the BIS Entity List they will be blocked from outsourcing the manufacturing of any types of chips at all.

These enforcement hooks are very similar to those that the United States levied upon Huawei’s chip design subsidiary HiSilicion which devastated HiSilicon and forced it out of the market for several years. To state it bluntly these recent actions are designed to put the roughly 28 Chinese chip design and supercomputing firms on the parties of concern lists out of business.

There are however very capable Chinese AI chip design companies such as Cambricon that are not yet on the Entity List. This is surprising because Cambricon’s customers include companies blacklisted by the U.S. government that supply supercomputers to the Chinese military. The slow pace of the current process for adding Chinese companies to the blacklist has been a source of intense frustration for both Congress and the White House. It ought to have been completed in time to include in this policy. Still do not be surprised if Cambricon and every other Chinese chip design company of any significance is added to the backlist in the near future. The revised rules for managing the Entity List which were released on the same day as the new policy are designed to help the Department of Commerce manage the list much faster.

Even with these steps in place there would still be a path for China to escape the United States’ semiconductor chokepoints—albeit a complicated expensive and risky one. This hypothetical path would be to design the chips in China pirate older EDA software and manufacture the chips in China using older manufacturing technology. This “all-Chinese” semiconductor supply chain strategy is in fact a logical extension of the one Huawei announced that it intends to pursue this year with a resurrected HilSilicon business.

However the Biden administration has taken steps to stomp out that approach as well which brings us to the third and fourth chokeholds of the policy.

Block China from manufacturing advanced chips by choking off access to U.S.-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

As mentioned above the United States has a dominant position in many categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment such that there is no advanced semiconductor fabrication facility in the world that is not critically dependent upon U.S. technology. Moreover this U.S. equipment dependence is in many cases not only in the form of a one-time purchase but also a constant need for the U.S. equipment provider to be onsite providing advice troubleshooting problems and repairing equipment. The need for this enduring relationship between buyer and seller offers the U.S. government additional points of control and leverage.

With these latest rules the United States has dramatically restricted the supply of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to all of China. Additionally the rules also restrict the supply of a much more broadly applicable set of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (e.g. inspection and metrology equipment) to those companies in China that are currently making advanced chips (such as SMIC and YMTC). In doing this the Biden administration is going beyond the traditional U.S. policy of seeking to keep the United States’ two semiconductor technology nodes ahead of China and is now trying to actively degrade China’s technological maturity below its current level.

Similar to the restrictions on AI chip sales the restrictions on chip manufacturing equipment sales are targeted at certain performance thresholds that represent advanced chip manufacturing technology. These thresholds are split by those types of equipment that are specifically useful for making different types of computer chips: logic chips DRAM (short-term memory) chips and NAND (long-term memory) chips.

The Biden administration is going beyond the traditional U.S. policy of seeking to keep the United States’ two semiconductor technology nodes ahead of China and is now trying to actively degrade China’s technological maturity below its current level.

For logic chips China will now face licensing requirements with a presumption of denial for any fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) logic manufacturing equipment. In practice this affects nearly all logic chips being produced at the 16 nanometer (nm) or lower (better) technology nodes. For comparison U.S. chipmaker Intel first began mass-producing 14-nm processors in 2014 but the most advanced Chinese logic chip manufacturer SMIC only achieved 14-nm FinFET mass production this year an eight-year gap. The United States is blocking the export of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to all of China but in the case of SMIC’s 14-nm production facility the United States is even blocking the export of older less advanced equipment. In other words the United States is attempting to put SMIC’s 14-nm production line out of business.

For the more advanced successor to FinFET called Gate-All-Around Field Effect Transistor (GAAFET) China will also face broad restrictions on purchasing of U.S. manufacturing equipment.

For DRAM the equipment sale restrictions will apply at the 18-nm process node and more advanced (a lower nm number). For NAND the restrictions will apply for 128 layers or higher. These restrictions threaten the economic prospects of Chinese memory chip companies such as YMTC which Apple stated that it had recently been evaluating as a supplier for iPhones sold in China—to the fury of some U.S. lawmakers. As with logic chips the new restrictions include a much broader set of equipment sale restrictions for chip factories in China that are already producing at or above the threshold. The U.S. government is attempting to put YMTC’s most advanced NAND production facilities out of business.

It will be especially difficult for Chinese companies to evade these equipment export controls. Without access to the support teams and spare parts of U.S. equipment suppliers these facilities may be forced to slow or halt production. Even if the existing advanced production facilities at SMIC and YMTC somehow manage to continue producing they are unlikely to be joined by other companies and facilities in China anytime soon. Overall these new restrictions represent a devastating blow for the makers of advanced chips in China. However China has been anticipating significantly broadened manufacturing equipment export controls so it has been purchasing equipment at a pace far in excess of expected market demand. In essence China has been buying everything it can from the store before it closes. The full consequences of China’s equipment hoarding are not yet clear.

Block China from developing its own semiconductor manufacturing equipment by choking off access to U.S.-built components.

Designing and building the equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is among the most technologically complex expensive and difficult undertakings that occur anywhere in the global economy. Of all the semiconductor supply chain chokepoints where the United States has significant leverage over China this is the one with by far the most durable competitive advantage. However just in case China plans to launch a crash program to develop its own equipment to manufacture semiconductors the Biden administration has added license restrictions intended to block the export of any components or items on the Commerce Control List that would go toward that purpose. Without U.S. components China’s efforts to developing a domestic semiconductor equipment industry would be starting from scratch and attempting to replicate the cumulative achievements of the U.S. semiconductor industry over the past seven decades. It is an extremely tall mountain to climb.

Three Key Takeaways from the Biden Administration’s Actions

In summary the United States does not want China to have advanced AI computing and supercomputing facilities so it has blocked them from purchasing the best AI chips which are all American. It does not want China designing its own AI chips so it has blocked China from using the best chip design software (which is all American) to design high-end chips and it has blocked chip manufacturing facilities worldwide from accepting entity-listed Chinese chip design firms (as well as any Chinese chip company building high-end chips) as customers. Finally the United States does not want China to have its own advanced chip manufacturing facilities so it has blocked them from purchasing the necessary equipment much of which is irreplaceably American.

In weaponizing its dominant chokepoint positions in the global semiconductor value chain the United States is exercising technological and geopolitical power on an incredible scale. The targeted nature of the Biden administration’s actions here suggests three important implications about its worldview.

First the United States believes that China is willing to take extraordinary measures—including but not limited to spending hundreds of billions of dollars hacking U.S companies and creating networks of shell companies—in order to evade export controls and free itself from dependence on U.S. semiconductor supply chains. The four interlocking chokeholds in the U.S. policy are also extraordinary measures. However the past decade of Chinese technological progress shows that anything less simply will not work. Take for example the fact that the new export controls not only block the sales of the items but also effectively prohibit U.S. individuals and corporations from facilitating such exports or transferring any relevant technological know-hows. When it comes to China’s AI and semiconductor industries the United States is done with half measures.

In weaponizing its dominant chokepoint positions in the global semiconductor value chain the United States is exercising technological and geopolitical power on an incredible scale.

Second the United States is not wielding its semiconductor supply chain power to force China into an economic recession and inflationary spiral as this year’s U.S.-led technology export controls against Russia were intended to do. Rather the United States is wielding its power forcefully but at a limited set of Chinese targets in order to preserve U.S. chip power and leverage over the long term. The Biden administration is signaling that it believes that—despite all the United States’ considerable technological advantages in semiconductors—its lead is not so overwhelming that China would never have caught up. The Biden administration clearly believes that government action is and will continue to be required in order to preserve and extend U.S. leadership in semiconductors.

Based on an incomplete picture of the Biden administration’s policy critics have said that the recent export controls are wastefully spending that power prematurely. Now that the policy’s fuller dimensions are clear it would be more accurate and appropriate to say that the Biden administration is spending some of that power in order to invest in its future. In that regard these actions are fully consistent with the Biden administration’s other flagship semiconductor policy the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act which commits the U.S. government to investing $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research development manufacturing and workforce development. Perhaps that major investment will partially assuage the concerns of U.S. semiconductor companies about their lost revenue from China.

Third this policy signals that the Biden administration believes the hype about the transformative potential of AI and its national security implications is real. Right now the performance benchmarks for the advanced AI chips that China is prohibited from purchasing only apply to a relatively small set of overall market demand. However the Biden administration intends to hold those benchmarks constant meaning that the gap in performance will grow over time as the world advances and China remains stuck behind. It is as though the United States is saying to China “AI technology is the future. We and our allies are going there. You can’t come.”

The Biden administration clearly believes that government action is and will continue to be required in order to preserve and extend U.S. leadership in semiconductors.

Key Challenges and Questions for the Policy Community

Overall this policy represents an astutely targeted step forward for U.S. national security and technology leadership in both AI and semiconductors. But there are lingering gaps in the policy that the Biden administration should swiftly seek to address.

These export restrictions apply to U.S.-owned entities operating in China but they do not apply to Chinese-owned entities operating in for example India. In fact there are no U.S. export controls that apply specifically to a company’s country of ownership. This greatly increases the challenges associated with preventing the international subsidiaries of Chinese corporations from smuggling chips into China in violation of U.S. export controls. Imagine if several Chinese cloud computing giants purchased 10 percent more AI chips than they need at dozens of their hyperscale datacenters outside of China and then worked to smuggle those excess chips back into China.

All Chinese AI Chip design organizations need to go on the Entity List and the Department of Commerce needs the intent and resources to manage the Entity List much more rapidly. It is extremely telling that the department was unable to add leading Chinese AI chip companies such as Cambricon to the Entity List in time for the rollout of this policy. Chinese organizations can change shell companies to evade export controls in a matter of days or weeks. The Department of Commerce should be empowered to act equally as fast. Fortunately another set of rule changes announced on the same day changed the handling of the Unverified List (a sort of precursor to the Entity List for cases the government has not yet been able to verify an organization’s bona fides) and suspended the use of export license exemptions for companies on the Unverified List. With this rule change the Department of Commerce can now effectively block exports to any Chinese organization in 60 days. This provides a much faster and more flexible response to Chinese shell companies and other export evasion tactics.

While this policy dramatically raises the obstacles to China’s production of an indigenous supply chain China is not going to give up. The local government of Shenzen a key hub of China’s tech sector has already established a series of subsidies for organizations that purchase open source or Chinese alternatives to U.S. EDA software and chip intellectual property. Moreover these most recent policies primarily focus on advanced chips at high technology nodes. China may now focus on gaining market leverage over older semiconductor technologies. Legacy semiconductor designs made with older technology nodes (>28 nm) still play an important role in the global economy. There are two large markets where older chip technologies remain competitive: (1) chips for devices such as washing machines that do not require the latest technologies and (2) chips for safety critical systems such as aerospace automotive and infrastructure systems that are reluctant to change designs that have already made it through lengthy integrated system tests.



China’s share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has grown from 9 percent in 2011 to 16 percent in 2021 making it the third-largest producer (including Chinese facilities owned by non-Chinese companies) after South Korea and Taiwan. Since Chinese wafer fabrication facilities or fabs lack the technology required to make modern advanced chips their manufacturing capacity is overwhelmingly concentrated in older chip technology nodes. The current global semiconductor supply chain crisis has demonstrated that even shortages of less advanced chips can be economically devastating. The United States needs to examine the full spectrum of possible paths to China gaining an advantageous position of leveraging the semiconductor value chain and assess whether or not these paths deserve a policy response.

These actions make clear that the Biden administration’s policy is to both exploit and protect leading U.S. positions in the semiconductor value chain. However it is not obvious that all U.S. government activities are aligned behind that goal. For example the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is currently funding research and development into open-source technologies that may compete with the dominant proprietary solutions offered by U.S. semiconductor companies thereby offering China a non-export-controlled path to desirable capabilities. If that is indeed the case those programs will need to be refocused. (The public descriptions do not provide sufficient detail for a definitive answer.) Open-source technology communities often have a charming David vs. Goliath storyline but in cases where the United States is Goliath and China is David the Biden administration needs to make sure that all organizations of the U.S. government are taking actions that support the right team.

The United States has a dominant position in many segments of the semiconductor supply chain but other countries have strong positions in other segments and have been frustrated by some aspects of recent U.S. policy. The export controls and sanctions against Russia from earlier this year were successful in large part because they were multilateral and included the participation of every major chip-producing country except China. These most recent Biden administration actions included prior consultation with allies but they are fundamentally unilateral. The United States needs to ensure that all of its allies are rowing in the same direction when it comes to keeping China’s semiconductor industry down. Taiwan’s government signaled on October 8 that Taiwanese companies would comply with the law but cooperation from Europe Japan and South Korea is also needed. In the case of South Korea the policy states that semiconductor manufacturing operations owned and operated by international firms are subject to a license condition but not a “presumption of denial.” This flexibility will be helpful in getting South Korea which has invested significantly in Chinese semiconductor manufacturing operations on board with the overall policy. However turning these unilateral export controls into multilateral ones will be a major challenge. Expect this to be a key White House diplomatic priority for discussions with Europe Japan Taiwan and South Korea going forward.

Finally and perhaps most importantly the job of the Department of Commerce’s BIS in terms of administering the export licensing process and enforcing these export controls has gotten exponentially more difficult. From the perspective of China and Russia U.S. export controls are inflicting tens of billions of dollars of economic pain and an even greater amount of lost future economic growth potential. All of these losses represent the opportunity for a huge return on investment for Chinese and Russian organizations that successfully evade these export controls. While there is no realistic way to reliably measure how much Russia and China are increasing their investment in export control evasion activity there is every reason to suspect that Russia and China are massively increasing. Is Congress preparing to massively increase investment in BIS in response? Unfortunately the answer thus far is mostly no. BIS’s budget has increased significantly but the vast majority of that increased spending is for entirely unrelated new missions that Congress and the White House assigned to BIS such as policing U.S. imports of technology from companies such as Huawei and regulating the exports of small firearms (a responsibility recently moved from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce). BIS not only needs additional financial and staffing resources but it also needs additional support from the intelligence community and the White House should make clear to intelligence community leadership that supporting BIS’s enforcement of export controls is a mission at which they need to excel.

Analysts said the move could hobble China's domestic chip industry. Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images

China's ambitions to boost its domestic chip industry has likely become magnitudes more difficult and costly after the U.S. launched some of its most wide-ranging export controls related to technology against Beijing. On Friday the U.S. Department of Commerce introduced sweeping rules aimed at cutting China off from obtaining or manufacturing key chips and components for supercomputers in what is seen as a huge escalation in tensions between Beijing and Washington in the technology sphere. America argues that such advanced semiconductors can be used by China for advanced military capabilities. ""There is no going back to the way things were"" Abishur Prakash co-founder of the Center for Innovating the Future an advisory firm told CNBC. ""With the latest action the chasm between the U.S. and China has now expanded to the point of no return."" Here are some of the highlights of the new U.S. rules: Companies require licenses to export high-performance chips usually designed for artificial intelligence applications to China.

Even foreign-made chips related to AI and supercomputing that use American tools and software in the design and manufacturing process will require a license to be exported to China.

U.S. companies will be heavily restricted in exporting machinery to Chinese companies that are manufacturing chips of a certain sophistication.

""The latest chip rules are a sign that Washington is not trying to rebuild relations with Beijing. Instead the U.S. is making it clear that it's taking this competition more seriously than it ever has and is willing to take steps that were once unthinkable"" Prakash said.

What impact will U.S. restrictions have on China?

Semiconductors are some of the most important technology products. They go into everything from smartphones to cars and refrigerators. But they're also seen as key to military applications and advancing artificial intelligence. As geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have ramped up in the past few years technology and in particular sensitive areas like chips have been dragged into the battle. Artificial intelligence quantum computing and semiconductors are all areas China has identified as ""frontier"" technologies it wants to boost its domestic capabilities in. But the new U.S. rules will make that extremely hard particularly in the area of chips. ""The U.S. has formally shifted its goal from outpacing China in the semiconductor industry to actively denying it access to advanced chips"" Pranay Kotasthane chairperson of the high tech geopolitics program at the Takshashila Institution told CNBC. ""China's homegrown chip sector will be hobbled by these extensive controls.""

The nature of the supply chain

The reason why the U.S.'s export controls could be so effective is how they could touch several parts of the semiconductor supply chain even those not directly based in America or controlled by American firms. That comes down to the global nature of the chip supply chain but also how power and expertise is controlled by very few companies. The United States while strong in many areas of the market has lost its dominance in manufacturing. Over the last 15 years or so Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung have come to dominate the manufacturing of the world's most advanced semiconductors. Intel  the United States' largest chipmaker fell far behind.

Reinventing the wheel will be far more costly now (for China). Pranay Kotasthane Takshashila Institution

Taiwan and South Korea make up about 80% of the global foundry market. Foundries are facilities that manufacture chips that other companies design. The U.S. however still boasts strong companies in the area of design tools many of which are used by other companies in the supply chain. For example it's unlikely that advanced chips manufactured by TSMC won't have used American tools somewhere along the way. In this instance the U.S. export restrictions to China will apply. Washington has used this so-called foreign direct product rule before on the poster child of the Trump-era U.S.-China tech tensions — Huawei. Under those rules Huawei was cut off from the most advanced chips that TSMC was manufacturing and that were designed for its smartphones. Huawei which was once the number one player in the smartphone market saw its handset business crippled. But never has such a rule been used so widely by the U.S.

The event was ultimately held without the top executive who had a more important date: the signing in Washington DC of a law put in place by the Joe Biden administration to inject $52 billion into the development of this crucial industry in the United States.

The overlapping dates were not entirely a coincidence. Intel has spent the last few years trying to balance out the weight of its operations in Asia while the Biden administration is promoting local semiconductor production as a key element for the US economy and security in the context of tension with China in a battle of tech giants that has placed Costa Rica just a three-hour flight from Miami in a winning position.

The stars have aligned for the small Central American nation. After Intel moved its manufacturing operations to Asia in 2015 taking away an activity that accounted for 20% of Costa Rican exports the plant was reactivated again in 2020 with an announced investment of $350 million that ended up growing to $1 billion including a 60% increase in staff to nearly 4000 workers in 2022 and even more expansion plans for what may come in the future said Timothy Scott Government Relations Manager of Intel Costa Rica in an interview.

Whatever may come it is likely to be advantageous for the economy of a country where Intel first established a presence in 1997. “Although [the law signed by Biden] specifically focuses on the United States due to the geographical proximity and the existing capacities it could generate an expansive wave” explained Scott recognizing the fact that Costa Rica is already home to research and global services centers.

The assembly and testing operations on semiconductors in Costa Rica are a stage in the production chain that comes after the manufacture of silicon wafers which Intel is developing in Ohio. The latter activity could increase through new investments announced in recent months in other American states as a result of the CHIPS Act which was passed by Congress in July of this year.

“If the capacity to produce wafers is increased it stands to reason that the assembly capacity must also be increased and the closest point for that is Costa Rica” added Scott who declined to reveal “for security” reasons the share that Costa Rica represents in the total production of Intel which controls at least 12% of the world’s semiconductor market. The company’s other manufacturing plants are in Malaysia Vietnam and the city of Chengdu in southwest China but restrictions due to the pandemic and disruptions in global logistics have made it more attractive to prioritize short distances.

Meanwhile the battle for the tiny silicon brains is not letting up. The US government on Friday announced that US companies will be banned from supplying Chinese customers with certain categories of semiconductors made with US technology in a move that deals a blow to China’s production of weapons and supercomputers. It is the latest escalation in a bilateral battle that accelerated on August 2 with the surprise visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan the world’s leading semiconductor producer in a trip viewed by China as a provocation in its own backyard.

Costa Rican officials are viewing every move with caution but also with optimism said Science and Technology Minister Carlos Enrique Alvarado. Figures handled by the Ministry of Foreign Trade indicate that in 2021 integrated circuits generated $518 million per exported product or one out of every $20 of the value of total exports. The figures for chips are still lower than in their heyday between 2005 and 2015 but they have been posting a rapid recovery hand in hand with other dynamic sectors such as medical devices which are currently one of Costa Rica’s leading exports and part of the local technology ecosystem of which Intel was a forerunner."

Taylor Corp. offers a change management blueprint,"After coming up short three times in attempts to move its 86 independently operated subsidiaries to a standard set of back-office applications Taylor Corp. is now succeeding in what amounts to a master class on the importance of thoughtful change management.

Under an ambitious four- to five-year project dubbed Horizon Taylor is replacing most of its on-premises systems—85 of them in all when you count different versions of the same system some of them no longer vendor-supported—with Oracle Cloud financial supply chain and manufacturing applications. The company also evaluated SAP and Microsoft applications but chose Oracle mainly because of the maturity of the Oracle Cloud environment says Jenn Warpinski vice president of enterprise transformation who Taylor hired in 2020 to oversee Horizon and the company’s broader digital transformation.

Privately held Taylor was founded in Minnesota in 1975 by entrepreneur Glen Taylor who grew the business from a wedding invitation printer to a diversified global company operating printing data and marketing businesses many brought in via acquisition. Until Horizon each unit maintained its own legacy systems which included the likes of Lawson Baan and Monarch as well as custom-developed systems and a few mainframe systems.

Taylor’s main goals with the Oracle Cloud implementation? Consolidate and standardize data and processes to make more-timely and more-informed financial customer supplier and other decisions. Modernize and automate previously manual processes which were costly and time-consuming. Reduce the technology debt accumulated from having to manage outdated systems. And ultimately make it much easier for customers to do business with the company across its different units. Taylor estimates that Horizon when completed also will yield $20 million to $30 million in total cost savings.

As an example of the business benefits one of Taylor’s five multi-subsidiary enterprise groups currently has customer information sitting in 16 different systems. That makes it difficult for the group to cross-sell products across business lines—Taylor units sell everything from printed wedding invitations brochures signs and consumer-product labels to digital marketing services. “We’re trying to pull that information out so that we have one view of the customer across the company” Warpinski says.

of enterprise transformation.

Before wave one of the Horizon standardization effort—a global rollout of Oracle Cloud Financials applications completed in January 2022—Taylor’s finance teams typically needed a couple of weeks to assemble a consolidated view of outstanding accounts receivables across the company Warpinski says. Now that data is available for executives to act on in real time.

And now that Taylor is live on a global instance of Oracle Cloud Procurement it can attempt to negotiate better volume discounts with approved indirect suppliers while end users can get approvals and execute orders for such supplies with a couple of simple email clicks.

One of Taylor’s enterprise groups is slated to deploy Oracle Cloud Supply Chain Management & Manufacturing applications—including CPQ (configure price quote) order management direct procurement demand and supply planning inventory management and warehouse management—under wave three of the Horizon rollout. Additional enterprise groups will deploy through 2024 and beyond. One expected benefit of the SCM application rollout is to give Taylor better more-timely data on the profitability of each product and customer.

A CEO's personal mission

Many companies pay lip service to the importance of “executive sponsorship” when embarking on an ambitious digital transformation program of this type. At Taylor Charlie Whitaker who became CEO of the $2 billion-a-year company in June 2020 has made the success of Horizon his personal mission.

On a kickoff videoconference early on Whitaker rallied the company’s 10000 employees to view Horizon as critical to Taylor’s growth and prosperity—and to embrace the changes required rather than resist them a problem that dragged down the previous application standardization projects none of which involved Oracle. Whitaker has since led steering-committee meetings led working sessions with project team members and took part in videos to update employees on the progress of Horizon.

“If you talk with Charlie it's not an option to participate. It’s a requirement: Don’t debate it participate in it which I think is a fantastic message” Warpinski says.

Yet there’s still room for discussion. If a subsidiary is using a supply chain or other application that’s providing some competitive advantage not readily available in an Oracle Cloud application “we will figure out a way to integrate it” Warpinski says. “We’re having those conversations individually but we have really really great executive support across the company for Horizon.”

Taylor Corp. CEO Charlie Whitaker encouraged employees

to embrace the Horizon project from the start.

Also key to the past and projected success of Horizon is Taylor’s relationship with implementation partner Oracle Consulting which created a comprehensive change management program for the application rollout one that goes beyond communications and training.

The starting point is a discussion of the standard way the Oracle application is designed to manage a process—say invoice matching. “We ask ‘Why won’t this work for you? How is it different from what you’re doing today?’” says Betsie Reynolds the vice president who leads Oracle’s transformation services team. “We listen to the answers and can manage around them. We advise clients not to focus so much on what the technology can do that you can’t focus on what’s changing for your people.”

At a design thinking workshop early on teams from Taylor and Oracle discussed how to develop the “traits of a successful cloud culture” including acceleration (make decisions adopt more efficient ways of working more quickly) and versatility (encourage employees to move seamlessly across roles). A monthly pulse survey gauges how Taylor’s front-line employees are feeling about the implementation to determine whether the overall plan needs adjusting.

After the first month of the wave one rollout the survey showed “sunshine and rainbows and lollipops”—everyone was excited about the new capabilities Reynolds recalls. But in month two the survey revealed growing concern among employees about their ability to do their day jobs and perform the needed implementation work—giving CEO Whitaker the opportunity to jump in and ask the program team to investigate options to ease the pressure. Taylor CFO Paola Lucente was an active champion during the challenging times of the wave one financial application rollout.

A unique feature of Oracle Consulting’s transformation services group is its creative team consisting of former ad and marketing agency people who worked with Taylor’s finance supply chain and other stakeholders to create a project narrative to share with all employees complete with Horizon branding. The creative team designed Horizon-branded backgrounds for Microsoft Teams calls related to the project. A monthly email newsletter that sports an interactive Horizon logo asks employees for feedback on what excites or concerns them about the project. Employees wear Horizon logo T-shirts and other swag.

A change management turning point

As Taylor continues to move different processes and units to the cloud over the next few years it will be critical to keep employees motivated in anticipation of the longer-term benefits Warpinski says.

Warpinski says a turning point was when several Taylor managers who were skeptical about the project early on started chiming in on Horizon calls to encourage colleagues who were having their own doubts about the project as they were getting started.

“They’re now jumping in and they’re doing the talking they’re doing the change management” she says. “And they're saying ‘No you guys don’t understand. I thought the same way you did. But you’ve got to get on board now.’ Seeing that other people are doing that besides my team and Oracle's change management team just makes me so excited.”

(Taylor’s Warpinski and Oracle’s Reynolds will lead a session on October 19 at Oracle CloudWorld in Las Vegas titled “How a Focus on Culture Accelerates Cloud Adoption at Taylor Corporation” in which they’ll go into more depth on the ongoing Horizon implementation.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjIxMDEwMDA1MjI2L2VuL1N0ZWxsYXItQ3liZXItUHJvdmlkZXMtQ3VzdG9tZXJzLXdpdGgtRW5oYW5jZWQtU2VjdXJpdHktT3BlcmF0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stellar Cyber Provides Customers with Enhanced Security Operations,"SANTA CLARA Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stellar Cyber Inc. a leading provider of Open XDR and a member of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) today announced that it has achieved Powered by Oracle Cloud Expertise for its SaaS security operations platform which is now available on Oracle Cloud Marketplace.

Industry Trends

Today as much as half of IT spending goes into building the infrastructure that can support cloud computing. Lockdown mandates prompted the importance of enterprise computing platforms for businesses to enable their employees to access computing infrastructure applications and data remotely from wherever they are operating.

Moreover AR VR and the metaverse already on the horizon would offer new growth opportunities to cloud computing. The metaverse will mimic internet capabilities today with enhanced capabilities and an amplified compute consumption rate. In many ways this will act as a significant growth driver for cloud services and infrastructure deployment expenditures over the next decade.

The benefits of using cloud services are immense especially for small and medium-scale businesses that usually find it challenging to co-op with the rising costs of maintaining IT infrastructure. SMEs use cloud services to avoid the costs required to buy or maintain their own computing infrastructure.

Using cloud services means companies can expedite their projects without a lengthy procurement process and substantial initial investments as all they pay is for the resources they consume. Especially for applications with big peak usage and are only used periodically throughout the year it might make financial sense to have them hosted in the cloud rather than having the system idle most of the time.

Moving services like email or CRM to a cloud-hosted application enable significant savings. Also moving to a services model means moving spending from capital expenditure (capex) to operational expenditure (OPEX). Therefore this business agility concept is often considered a key benefit. Cloud computing is a novel computing model helping companies in their digital transformation.

Enterprise cloud computing service providers create many opportunities to reduce overall IT costs with more flexibility network security and scalability. Although not a perfect solution for every business scenario cloud computing is more cost-competitive in terms of its integration with existing IT infrastructure and software costs ROI performance and security.

Cloud computing provides resources as general utilities that users can lease and release through the Internet in an on-demand model. Rapid developments in processing & storage technologies and the penetration of the Internet have enabled computing resources to be more cost-effective powerful and easily available than ever before.

Yes diesel engines will still power the world for the time being but decarbonization shifts are happening. Battery electric trucks are rolling in regional haul applications and investments are being poured into hydrogen fuel cell development. To complicate matters there is one decarbonization certainty: You can’t wait for a magic bullet solution.

“Decarbonization starts today. That’s our mentality on how we’re approaching our products” said Uma Vajapeyazula product strategy Cummins. “We’re not going to wait for the infrastructure to be ready for things to work out perfectly. We’re going to figure out how we start decarbonization as we build our product portfolios.”

Most immediately that means moving toward a fuel-agnostic engine platform evolving the Cummins X- and B-Series engines. Diesel will still be a core offering but natural gas gasoline propane and even hydrogen Cummins engines will come to market. In fact the most recent announcement was that PACCAR will offer the Cummins X-15N natural gas engine in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks. On top of that gasoline engine prototypes of the Cummins B6.7 were put through their paces on a test track in Columbus Indiana during a recent press event. The fuel agnostic engine platform transition is happening with the goal of lowering emissions.

“We’re driving reductions in NOx we’re driving reductions in CO2 we’re championing decarbonization efforts” Vajapeyazula said. “We want to bring lower NOx products to the market without disrupting the industry or making the products too complex expensive or unreliable. We’re trying to partner with alternate fuel providers that will play a big role. The questions we face are: How do you make it renewable? How do you bring natural gas in a big way to the market? How do you create incentive for the hydrogen infrastructure to pick up?”

Critics might say that those solutions are great but they’re still producing emissions. That’s true but reducing emissions right now adds up to big environmental savings in the near term. Those savings compound over the long term.

“The way I look at it is if you have 100000 vehicles on the market and I improve the carbon efficiency by 10% by lowering the greenhouse gas from our portfolio by 10% then that’s the equivalent of putting 10000 electric vehicles on the road at the same cost as diesel same assets no new technologies no recharging concerns and no infrastructure dependency” Vajapeyazula explained. “That is an impact we can make today.”

In regional haul applications Cummins sees battery electric powertrains as a reality when the application range is 200 miles or so. Its recent acquisition of Meritor and its partnership with Isuzu to power battery electric trucks shows the engine manufacturer is serious about electrification. Long-haul applications are a different decarbonization story.

With Cummins’s fuel-agnostic engine approach the question is no longer: “How will these fuels work in an engine?” The engines (in the case of natural gas and diesel) exist today. You can actually order one. So the question is: “How will fuels like renewable diesel and natural gas and even hydrogen when it’s ready for prime time be supported in the market? And most importantly how will fleets make money with them?”

For those answers let’s dive into the engine details. Click below to read more on Cummins’s approach to a specific engine technology.

Unlike perimeter security it doesn't assume people inside an organization are automatically safe. Instead it requires every user and device -- inside and out -- to be authorized before any access is granted. Users and devices are then continuously reverified to maintain security.

This is an attractive proposition in a world where the number of adversaries and insider threats both negligent and malicious are growing. But while the zero-trust model offers significant advantages it's not perfect. Plus abandoning one cybersecurity strategy for another is neither quick nor easy. This is especially true for large organizations or those with legacy security systems in place. Moving to a zero-trust model may sound enticing -- or even be obligatory -- but leaders must also consider the disruption that comes with such a transition.

Making zero-trust cybersecurity as effective as possible starts by understanding its challenges.

1. A piecemeal approach to zero-trust cybersecurity can create gaps Most companies customize their zero-trust strategies using a piecemeal approach but gaps or cracks may develop that make zero trust less ironclad than advertised. At the same time unwinding legacy hardware and software can create unexpected security lapses. Many zero-trust deployments require major architectural hardware and software changes to be successful.

3. Legacy systems may not adapt to zero trust Retrofitting legacy systems and applications -- which were built with perimeters in mind -- with zero trust isn't always possible. These legacy pieces may either need to remain in place which can create security gaps or require different security deployments to protect them or need to be ripped and replaced which can be costly and time-consuming.

4. Zero trust requires ongoing administration maintenance Another frequently overlooked obstacle to switching to a zero-trust cybersecurity model is the need for ongoing administration. In some scenarios additional staff or the use of managed services is required. Zero-trust models rely on a vast network of strictly defined permissions but companies are always evolving. People are hired move into new roles change locations resign and laid off all the time. Access controls must be updated each time to ensure the correct people have access to specific information. Keeping permissions accurate and up to date requires ongoing input which can be overwhelmingly difficult to keep up with. If permissions and controls aren't updated immediately upon an employee's role change or departure unauthorized parties could gain access to sensitive data. Imagine for example an employee who was fired but whose permissions weren't removed right away. That person could still access data and potentially go rogue underscoring the role of speed in a zero-trust strategy. If companies cannot act quickly in these situations data is at risk.

5. Zero trust can hinder productivity Introducing a zero-trust approach could potentially affect productivity. The core challenge of zero trust is locking down access without bringing workflows to a grinding halt. People require access to sensitive data to work communicate and collaborate. If individuals change roles and find themselves locked out of files or applications for a week productivity can plummet. In a worst-case scenario lost productivity becomes a bigger problem than cybersecurity itself. Zero trust requires communication across a wide array of data devices systems and people. If any of these is not in line with the others productivity and collaboration can suffer.

6. Zero trust isn't without security risks While zero trust's aim is to improve security it isn't immune to risks. Gartner outlined the following security risks: Trust brokers -- services that connect applications and users -- are potential points of failure and can be targets for attack.

Local physical devices can be attacked and have data exfiltrated from them.

User credentials can still be compromised.

The average enterprise has more than 40000 open source dependencies directly downloaded by developers. Each of those dependencies can bring in on average 77 other (transitive) dependencies creating a massive uncontrollable sprawl that slows down development and increases the attack surface across multiple dimensions.

The existing environment doesn’t have adequate solutions to deal with this problem. For example Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools lack context on how developers are using the dependencies. As a result they drown developers with endless false positives and miss the ability to influence better OSS selection prioritize remediation or detect malicious dependencies.

“Eighty percent of the code in modern applications is code your developers didn’t write but depend on through open source packages. When our founding team was leading the Prisma Cloud engineering group at Palo Alto Networks we realized the true magnitude of this issue” said co-founder and CEO Varun Badhwar. “Having previously created the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) category this team knows how to take on next generation threats. Our mission now is to enable OSS to live up to its true potential without introducing unnecessary risk. It’s exciting to once again take a new approach to the market and we believe these solutions will radically enhance application development everywhere.”

Endor Labs’ platform provides security and development teams with an unprecedented understanding of how dependencies are being used across their organization. Furthermore by performing deep analytics on each OSS dependency Endor Labs uncovers potential security and operational risks beyond just known vulnerabilities. Endor Labs helps customers select better dependencies; secure monitor and maintain them at scale; and quickly respond to incidents like Log4j. Having a full understanding of their dependency graph also lets customers generate and analyze accurate SBOMs and have a single source of truth for their entire software inventory.

This lifecycle approach to dependency management means it becomes easier than ever to reuse software across the org. The result is increased productivity for development and security teams and significantly reduced supply chain risk.

“Dependency Lifecycle Management is going to be absolutely foundational for supply chain and open source security” said Rachit Lohani SVP and chief technology officer of Paylocity. ""With Dependency Lifecycle Management Endor Labs is setting an entirely new standard by which organizations can prioritize and zero in on the most significant security and operational issues that have the tendency to slow down application development.”

Funding

The company also announced today that it has raised $25 million in seed financing from Lightspeed Venture Partners Dell Technologies Capital and Sierra Ventures and several industry luminaries who have recognized the massive problem Endor Labs is solving. These include CEOs and executives from Palo Alto Networks Zoom Snowflake Zscaler Netskope Rubrik Databricks Microsoft and more.

“Endor Labs serves a critical need — while open source software development continues to grow the way OSS dependencies and their influence on supply chain risk is managed today hinders development and leaves both engineering and security teams frustrated” said Arif Janmohamed Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. “They have carved out a market that is both massive and underserved and have assembled a world-class team to take on this challenge. These are exactly the qualities we seek to add to our portfolio and we look forward to a long and productive relationship with Endor Labs.”

“This team has a proven track record of being early to identify industry-wide cyber challenges that accompany fundamental big shifts in enterprise technologies” said Deepak Jeevankumar managing director at Dell Technologies Capital. “Just as the F500 began migrating to the cloud en masse Varun co-founded RedLock to build cloud-specific security solutions for them. Now as the efficiencies of open source software give way to hard to track/manage complexities Endor Labs is building the platform to secure the code those same businesses depend on. We’re honored with the opportunity to again back Varun along with Dimitri and the team they’ve built.”

Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the Paramount Global-backed premium cable network has declined to renew the series for a second season. The news comes as showrunners Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet had originally conceived the drama as a closed-ended limited series but changed course as they were halfway through making the first season. Sources say execs were very pleased with the show’s creative and felt the season came to a natural and fitting conclusion.

“Our thanks to the extraordinary Alex Kurtzman Jenny Lumet John Hlavin and Sarah Timberman who did a great job of turning the David Bowie film into such a resonant tale for our times” a Showtime spokesperson said in a statement to THR. “And kudos to a wondrous cast led by Chiwetel Ejiofor Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy for bringing it to life. Alex and Jenny originally intended The Man Who Fell To Earth to be a close-ended story. While we flirted with the idea of expanding it into a second season we all ultimately decided to embrace it as a one season story well told.”

Originally ordered to series for CBS All Access (now Paramount+) in 2019 The Man Who Fell to Earth was based on a 1963 novel by Walter Tevis (The Queen’s Gambit) which was adapted as a 1976 movie starring David Bowie. Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) starred in the drama and played a new alien who lands on our planet in a role that was crafted so as not to be compared to the one made famous by the late rocker. Harris Nighy Jimmi Simpson and Kate Mulgrew also starred in the series which was moved to Paramount+ corporate sibling Showtime in March 2021 as the drama better suited the cabler’s roster of premium programming.

Kurtzman and Lumet (Star Trek: Discovery) served as co-showrunners along with Hlavin (Shooter). They executive produced with Sarah Timberman Carl Beverly Heather Kadin and Rola Bauer and Françoise Guyonnet of Studiocanal.

CBS Studios produced the drama along with Timberman/Beverly and Kurtzman’s Secret Hideout. Studiocanal owns rights to Tevis’ novel and a 1976 movie starring David Bowie based on the book.

The decision to not move forward with more Man Who Fell to Earth sources say also predates the recent executive change at Showtime parent Paramount Global in which David Nevins — who led a portfolio that included Showtime — departed and oversight of the cabler was given to Chris McCarthy. It’s worth noting that premium scripted fare has not been a focus for McCarthy a rising star at the former Viacom. McCarthy oversees a suite of networks including MTV VH1 Comedy Central and Paramount Network. (McCarthy’s lieutenant Keith Cox is the gatekeeper for all of Taylor Sheridan’s shows on linear and streaming.) During McCarthy’s tenure he has largely taken Comedy Central and other networks out of the premium scripted space.

Showtime’s scripted roster includes the recently launched Let the Right One In and American Gigolo as well as Billions The Chi City on a Hill The L Word Yellowjackets and Your Honor among others.

Kurtzman and Lumet meanwhile continue to have overall deals with CBS Studios and have multiple other shows in the works for both Paramount+ and Showtime including the Star Trek franchise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvZm94LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtZ2xvYmFsLWZlcm5hbmRvLXN6ZXctbWlwY29tLWtyYXBvcG9saXMtZ3JpbXNidXJnLTEyMzUxNDA4Mjgv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC9mb3gtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1nbG9iYWwtZmVybmFuZG8tc3pldy1taXBjb20ta3JhcG9wb2xpcy1ncmltc2J1cmctMTIzNTE0MDgyOC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox Entertainment Global Boss Fernando Szew: “We Will Go Against The Grain Of Other U.S. Media Entities” – Mipcom,"Fox’s new Entertainment Global sales unit will “go against the grain of other U.S.-based media entities” by being wholly agnostic and selling to everyone according to CEO Fernando Szew.

Late last month the U.S. studio caused a splash by unveiling its return to the international distribution business after three years out the game with launch set to take place at next week’s Mipcom Cannes. Since then Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier has departed the business to Roku replaced by Rob Wade.

Speaking to Deadline in the lead-up to Mipcom which will see a keynote slate and cocktail party to launch Fox Entertainment Global Szew said the strength of the new sales unit lies in its ability to sell to everyone with no pressure to ‘warehouse’ content for its own streaming service. Fox Entertainment Global will be shopping content from Masked Singer producer Fox Alternative Entertainment Gordon Ramsay’s newly-formed Studio Ramsay Global Bob’s Burgers indie Bento Box Entertainment and Szew’s MarVista which specializes in TV movies.

“We can go against the grain of other U.S.-based media entities” said Szew. “They are for the most part trying to keep content for their paywalls and streaming services. We are arms wide open ready to take content that we believe will work into one of the biggest markets in the world trading to the international community.”

The likes of Sony and A+E have made similar arguments in the past contrasting themselves with studios that have recently launched streamers such as Paramount Global NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery.

Szew who runs MarVista which was bought by Fox in December 2021 stressed that Fox has an “ecosystem of platforms” such as AVoD Tubi but these won’t prevent Fox Entertainment Global from selling to all and sundry.

The company will be bringing the likes of Dan Harmon’s Krapopolis Jon Hamm-starrer Grimsburg and single-cam midseason comedy Animal Control to next week’s Mipcom Cannes the former of which are produced by Bento Box which was acquired in 2019.

Fox hasn’t had an international sales arm since that year when Fox Networks Group Content Distribution was integrated into Disney’s worldwide sales operation after the Mouse House bought Fox’s entertainment assets.

Going forwards Szew stressed that his unit will be “totally distinct” from Disney’s sales operation.

“We are the Fox moniker and the DNA is ours” he added. “I’m representing that wonderful brand and am excited to relaunch it.”

With that in mind Fox Entertainment Global will continue working with Propagate Content on non-scripted international distribution having partnered in recent years and the pair will share a stand at Mipcom.

Szew backed claims from Mipcom Director Lucy Smith that co-productions will be as important as straight distributor-to-buyer sales at this year’s market.

“There is more of a willingness to look at co-productions with wide eyes and open arms” he added. “We feel in a prime place to have those conversations because of our independence. And then we see the opportunity to satisfy local broadcasters and platforms’ desire for powerful content to be able to compete with global streamers entering the marketplace.”

The formation of Fox Entertainment Global was almost one year in the making added Szew who said it had been in the ether since the MarVista acquisition.

“There were a few key components to us getting there such as production infrastructure and content sales but now it feels like we’re turning a page on a new beginning” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vbG9zdHJlbW90ZS90aGUtbWFuLXdoby1mZWxsLXRvLWVhcnRoLW5vdC1yZXR1cm5pbmctc2Vhc29uLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Man Who Fell to Earth Not Returning for Season 2,"The Man Who Fell to Earth will not return for a second season.

A NEW ranking of London’s ‘rising star’ public market dealmakers includes only one women in its list of the capital’s top 30 youngsters.

The list compiled by financial intelligence firm MergerLinks is based on the size of deals and their perceived financial complexity.

Goldman Sachs’ Cara Pazdon is the only woman on the list.

The City has been home to a number of outsize deals over the past twelve months in part due to the perceived cheapness of UK equities.

That perceived underpricing which has been a marked feature of London’s listed markets since the vote to leave the European Union has been exacerbated by the weakness of the pound – making UK-listed firms tempting takeover targets.

Amongst the bankers on the list are Citigroups’ Rory Scott for work on the purchase of Meggitt by Parker Hannifin HSBC’s Alex Thomas for work on the merger of CapCo and Shaftesbury and JP Morgan’s Jonty Edwards.

Lawyers expect London’s dealmaking boom to continue despite ongoing economic uncertainty.

“Favourable exchange rates mean that UK targets are comparatively cheaper for US buyers exacerbated by depressed valuations for certain UK businesses in the face of recessionary pressures” Clifford Chance M&A partner Katherine Moir has previously told City A.M.

Corporate partner at law firm Eversheds Sutherland Jon Gill similarly said he expects to “see more such transactions in the months to come” as US private equity giants remain flush with cash and prices of tech firms in particular remain subdued.

UK firms are trading at around 10 times 2023 earnings far lower than in the US. Firms including Morrisons Stock Spirits and John Laing have all been picked up by private equity over the past two years amongst a host of others.

Organizers say this year featured more parade participants and performers on the floats.

Many paradegoers told Eyewitness News it's the shared love for the culture that keeps people coming back each year.

Groups institutions and partners from across the United States and Italy will take part in this year's celebration.

FISV is benefiting from strategic acquisitions and consistent share repurchases.

Factors That Bode Well

Fiserv continues to expand its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions. The recent buyout of Inexact is expected to boost Fiserv’s digital banking strategy by helping it offer its clients smooth and personalized digital banking experiences. Also the November 2021 buyout of BentoBox will enable Fiserv to cater to increasing demand for capabilities that enhance online interactions between merchants and customers.

Fiserv has been consistent with share buybacks. In 2021 Fiserv repurchased 23.3 million shares for $2.57 billion. During 2020 Fiserv bought back 16.1 million shares for $1.64 billion. In 2019 FISV repurchased 4.2 million shares for $394 million. Such moves instill investors’ confidence in the stock and boost the earnings per share.

Some Risks

Fiserv has more long-term debt outstanding than cash. Cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of second-quarter 2022 was $883 million compared with the long-term debt level of $20.9 billion.

A new policy in PayPal’s fine print triggered a storm of outrage over apparent plans to impose starting on Nov. 3 a hefty fine of $2500 any time one of its 429 million consumers and merchants expressed what the corporate brass deems to be misinformation.

PayPal quickly apologized over the weekend for what it called “confusion” claiming it was all just an error but not before a a deluge of criticism from a number of high-profile individuals—including its own former president David Marcus.

Marcus took to Twitter to say the new Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) was an “insanity” that forced him to come forward and criticize his previous employer where he worked for three years from 2011 after former PayPal owner eBay acquired a company he founded and joined it with the payments service.

“PayPal’s new AUP goes against everything I believe in” he posted on Saturday. “A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with.”

Agreed — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 8 2022

Free-speech advocates like Elon Musk one of the entrepreneurs behind the founding of PayPal as well as prominent conservative voices such as actor Kevin Sorbo likewise blasted the plans.

The controversy comes as tensions run high over misinformation claims heading into next month important midterm elections in the United States which could see the Republicans retake control over both houses of Congress.

‘Delete PayPal’

With many on the right fearing that Big Tech is targeting them due to their political views the company quickly backtracked.

“PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy” a spokesperson later told media outlets over the weekend. “We’re sorry for the confusion this has caused.”

Critics however didn’t appear to buy PayPal’s claims it was all just an innocent “error” that was promptly updated with the correct information.

PayPal isn’t sorry they’re just mad they got caught. — Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) October 9 2022

Dan Held the former head of growth marketing for crypto exchange Kraken and a Bitcoin fan argued users should delete accounts with the payment services provider.

“PayPal freezing funds for thought crimes is despicable” he wrote over the weekend in response to the controversy.

Many crypto fans like Held—often libertarians who oppose government intervention in much of society—believe the government and its corporate supporters are steadily chipping away at basic human rights.

They have been on high alert ever since the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash a service that conceals blockchain transactions by mixing them up with others so they are harder to trace.

Marcus the former PayPal president is himself a fan of Bitcoin and later ran Meta’s project to develop a crypto wallet. PayPal’s supposed new policy only exacerbated a common fear in the crypto community that the state will eventually seek to sideline virtual assets through the introduction of central bank digital currencies.

The intense blowback will not likely be helpful for PayPal shares which have thus far been a poor investment in 2022.

While payment services giant Visa declined by only 15% year to date PayPal has more than halved in value. Even eBay its former parent until 2015 has fared better having only fallen some 43% in the period.

Shares in PayPal are expected to open 1.5% lower on Monday underperforming the broader tech market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9kZWxldGUtcGF5cGFsLXNlYXJjaGVzLXNwaWtlLWFmdGVyLTItNTAwLW1pc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLWZpbmUtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktMTE2NjU0MjczOTbSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2RlbGV0ZS1wYXlwYWwtc2VhcmNoZXMtc3Bpa2UtYWZ0ZXItMi01MDAtbWlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tZmluZS1jb250cm92ZXJzeS0xMTY2NTQyNzM5Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Delete PayPal’ searches spike after $2500 misinformation fine controversy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/delete-paypal-searches-spike-after-2-500-misinformation-fine-controversy-11665427396 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9kZWxldGUtcGF5cGFsLXNlYXJjaGVzLXNwaWtlLWFmdGVyLTItNTAwLW1pc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLWZpbmUtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktMTE2NjU0MjczOTbSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2RlbGV0ZS1wYXlwYWwtc2VhcmNoZXMtc3Bpa2UtYWZ0ZXItMi01MDAtbWlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tZmluZS1jb250cm92ZXJzeS0xMTY2NTQyNzM5Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmUub3JnL25ld3MvZGlkLXBheXBhbC1yZXZlcnNlLWNvdXJzZS1wcm9wb3NlZC1zcGVlY2gtY2hpbGxpbmctcG9saWNpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did PayPal reverse course on proposed speech-chilling policies?,"It’s been a tough few weeks for PayPal.

First the company shut down the account of the Free Speech Union reinstating it only after many denounced PayPal’s apparently viewpoint-discriminatory decision. Then news emerged that PayPal was amending its acceptable use policy to add several new categories of prohibited speech. Last week FIRE criticized the proposed changes. Now PayPal appears to be backing off . . . somewhat at least.

As we said last week PayPal’s amended acceptable use policy which was slated to take effect Nov. 3 would have placed a significant amount of expression out of bounds:

The new policy dramatically expands PayPal’s power to take action against users for activity on the service involving disfavored speech. That includes “any messages content or materials that in PayPal’s sole discretion” are “harmful” or “objectionable” depict or even appear to depict nudity “depict promote or incite hatred or discrimination of protected groups” present a risk to a user’s “wellbeing” “promote misinformation” or are in PayPal’s opinion “otherwise unfit for publication.”

The amended policy also stated PayPal may fine users $2500 for each violation of the policy. And PayPal may debit that money straight from user accounts. That particular provision already exists in the current acceptable use policy which vaguely bans some expression such as “certain sexually oriented materials or services” and “promotion of hate violence racial or other forms of intolerance that is discriminatory or the financial exploitation of a crime.”

The amended policy would have made even more categories of prohibited speech subject to financial penalty.

One day after FIRE and others called out PayPal’s new speech-chilling restrictions the company walked back one of them. A PayPal spokesperson said notice of the policy changes “went out in error that included incorrect information” adding that “PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy.”

While this clarification sounds like a step in the right direction it nonetheless raises several questions. Will “misinformation” still be a banned category of speech just not one subject to a fine? Can PayPal even provide a definition of “misinformation” that isn’t dangerously overbroad and subject to abuse? Is PayPal still going forward with all of the other new ill-defined categories of prohibited speech? If so will violating any of those restrictions subject users to thousands of dollars in fees?

Meanwhile many have responded to PayPal’s censorship by saying they will no longer use the service. But some are claiming PayPal won’t let them close their accounts.

PayPal removed the amended acceptable use policy from its policy updates page and it has yet to replace it with a newly amended policy. We will watch the company’s next moves closely."

This marks the first formal challenge brought by an existing Boston Beer wholesaler to the company’s distribution agreement with PepsiCo for Hard MTN Dew. The timing of the challenge also comes just days before the start of the National Beer Wholesalers Association’s Annual Convention in Chicago this week ensuring it will be a hot topic of discussion among attendees.

In the 13-page complaint Blue Ridge and Premium argue that Boston Beer’s appointment of Blue Cloud violated the state’s beer franchise act (Beer Act) which reads: “no brewery shall enter into any agreement with more than one beer wholesaler for the purpose of establishing more than one agreement for its brands of beer in any territory.”

Premium has distributed Boston Beer offerings in northern central and southeastern Virginia since acquiring Northern Virginia Beverage (2004) Chesbay Distributing (2012) and Loveland Distributing (2018).

Meanwhile Blue Ridge has distributed Boston Beer products in western Virginia since being appointed by the brewery in the mid-1980s as well as through acquisitions of “several distributors” in southwest Virginia.

The distributors argue that the law prohibits Boston Beer from “entering into any agreement that splits the distribution rights to its brands of beer between different distributors in the same designated sales territory.” As such they argue Boston Beer “established an unlawful ‘dual-distribution’ scheme for its Hard MTN Dew brand” in the 37 counties and cities where Premium serves as Boston Beer’s “exclusive distributor” as well as the 43 counties and cities where Blue Ridge holds exclusivity. The law does allow for dual distribution deals in situations such as one brewery purchasing another but they note that this instance does not apply.

Premium and Blue Ridge also argue Boston Beer has “unilaterally amended” their distribution agreements by “eliminating” their role as Hard MTN Dew’s exclusive distributor in their respective territories without providing at least 90 days’ written notice.

“Boston Beer’s actions have been undertaken with full knowledge that the Beer Act does not permit a brewery (and the holder of a Virginia Beer Importer’s license) to divide its brands of malt beverages between two or more distributors appointed to service the same sales territory” the complaint reads.

Premium and Blue Ridge allege Boston Beer’s violations of the act were in “bad faith.”

“Boston Beer knew or should have known that its ‘collaboration’ with PepsiCo to manufacture the Hard MTN Dew brand of malt beverage and distribute the same exclusively through distributors owned and controlled by PepsiCo would trample on the long-standing exclusive franchise distribution rights that Boston Beer had already granted to its other distributors such as Premium and Blue Ridge” they argue.

“The appointment of a single county or city to which Boston Beer had already granted distribution rights to another could be reasonably termed a mistake” they continued. “To appoint 80 such cities and counties however displays a conscious disregard by Boston Beer towards both the good faith obligations owed to its existing distributors and to the laws of the Commonwealth.”

The distributors are asking the ABC to to enter orders:

holding Boston Beer in violation of the Beer Act;

nullifying the appointment of Blue Cloud as the distributor of Hard MTN Dew in territories already appointed to Premium and Blue Ridge;

barring Boston Beer from appointing any distributor other than Premium and Blue Ridge to distribute the company’s malt beverages in their respective sales territories;

asserting that Boston Beer acted in bad faith in violating the Beer Act;

awarding Premium and Blue Ridge “reasonable costs and attorney fees;”

and granting “such relief as the board shall deem appropriate.”

In a statement a Reyes spokesperson said: “We deeply respect Boston Beer and our longstanding business relationship but we are also committed to upholding the franchise laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. We cannot comment further due to the ongoing nature of the litigation.”

A Boston Beer spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbXVzZWJ5Y2wuaW8vbXVzaWMvaG93LXBlcHNpLWhlbHBlZC1zaGFwZS1kZWNhZGVzLW11c2ljcy1iaWdnZXN0LXN0YXJzLWFuZC13aGF0cy1uZXh00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Pepsi Helped Shape Decades of Music's Biggest Stars—and What's Next,"It was a high note to punctuate a history of successes. ""The Halftime Show was iconic for our brand and the artists that we worked with: 26 musical acts representing 168 Grammys and almost 1000 Billboard hits have graced the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show stage over the past 10 years"" says Harter. ""Our deep consumer connection is evident through the social media results which included winning the Twitter Brand Bowl three years in a row and earning 72 percent share of voice on social media among all other brands in 2022.""

To memorialize the herculean feat of putting on a Super Bowl Halftime Show with production partners the NFL and Roc Nation Pepsi last year debuted ""The Show"" a 90-minute documentary premiering on Showtime and chronicling the efforts behind The Weeknd's 2021 performance. But Pepsi sunsetting its lead billing for the annual event certainly doesn't mean the brand is stepping back from music.

""Pepsi's decision to leave the Halftime Show is the first move in its much larger strategic shift to bring unprecedented music and entertainment experiences to fans—where they are now and where they will be in the future"" says Harter. ""As entertainment evolves and the way people consume music changes Pepsi is working to guarantee the level of access and engaging experiences fans have come to expect from the brand.""

What makes a star a good partner for Pepsi?

""Each artist brings something different to the table—allowing us to reach new audiences in various ways"" says Harter. ""The artists must be a strong representation of our brand values and commitment to elevating the consumer experience. Sometimes we work with an artist because of their ability to deliver unapologetic enjoyment and other times we turn to them for their shared dedication to supporting and uplifting marginalized voices and communities.""

In fact more and more Pepsi's focus in the music space includes using its profile and resources not just to amplify some of the music industry's biggest voices but to elevate rising young talent as well—even those just starting their careers.

In 2018 the PepsiCo Foundation made a seven-year $18.2 million investment in She Feeds the World (SFtW) CARE’s flagship programme aimed at tackling gender inequality in agriculture. The multi-million-dollar grant aims to provide resources and training to five million women farmers and their families around the globe to help them increase crop yields and income. SFtW is currently underway in Egypt Peru Thailand and Vietnam and future programmes are in development.

Active in Uganda since 2018 to 2022 SFtW has reached over 540 000 people in Kyegegwa and Kyenjojo exceeding its target of 490 000 as a result of the Foundation’s $2 million investment in the country. While the Foundation has concluded the programme’s funding SFtW in Uganda leveraged its impact including securing over $1-million from other funders to ensure the longevity and sustainability of the programme.

Commenting on the programme’s success Devendri Adari PepsiCo Foundation Lead for Sub-Saharan Africa says “As the PepsiCo Foundation we believe in feeding potential and leveraging the strengths of our partner organisations on the ground to drive sustainable change. Our approach is to empower and equip communities that we support to be self-sustaining well into the future. It is heartening to see how this programme has transformed the lives of these community members. We are also proud that local governments and other entities are keen to replicate it to drive social and economic change in other communities.”

Echoing this sentiment is Apollo Gabazira the Country Director for CARE in Uganda who says “The approach and outcomes of this programme were multi-faceted and have laid a solid foundation for continued growth and transformation. Through various interventions the programme was able to improve crop yields increase sale of agricultural produce improve food security and transform community gender norms for sustainable long-term change.”

Recognising that food security and nutrition cannot be addressed in isolation SFtW adopts a holistic approach to tackling the challenge including empowering men to serve as change agents to challenge harmful gender norms in their communities and equip women with leadership skills.

She Feeds the World success stories

Below are two women whose involvement in the programme helped them break barriers and step into leadership positions within their homes and communities. In 2021 96 women ran for public office for the first time and 64 won the positions they were contesting. “This demonstrates that removing barriers to leadership for women can help them achieve their goals and contribute to creating more diverse equitable and inclusive societies” concludes Adari.

Jenifer Atuhaire and Agnes Isingoma challenged gender stereotypes and roles by standing for political office in their communities. They both overcame many hurdles including convincing their respective husbands that they could run and possibly win. Here are their stories.

Jenifer Atuhaire

Through the leadership workshops offered by SFtW Jenifer gained tools which helped build her confidence and realise her self-worth. At the same time Jenifer’s husband took part in one of SFtW’s “Male Action Groups” aimed at improving gender relations within households.

As a result of her new-found confidence and encouragement from her husband who now supports her professional pursuits as a result of the Male Action Group Jenifer ran for the Councillor position in her area during the Ugandan General Elections in 2021 she won and was elected as a Councillor for the 2021 to 2026 term.

Agnes and Pius Isingoma

Agnes and Pius a couple living in Western Uganda improved their marriage through the support and training they received from SFtW’s various initiatives including one run for men and boys called “Role Model Men” (RMM).

This programme teaches participants about gender equality and empowers them to challenge harmful gender norms in their communities. As an RMM participant Pius learnt how to let go of patriarchal beliefs and practices that prevented Agnes from pursuing her goals.

Between gaining more support from her husband and a sense of empowerment from the leadership training Agnes ran for a Councillorship position during this year’s elections. She also won and is now a public office holder.

With the newly completed acquisition — plans were announced in August — Pfizer gains GBT’s therapy portfolio and pipeline. The biopharmaceutical company also stands to benefit from GBT’s expertise in sickle cell potentially permitting it to act on the broad range of the community’s crucial needs.

Pfizer a 30-year leader in its own right in the space of rare blood disorders has pledged to continue building upon that legacy and the companies’ mutual commitment to and engagement with SCD patients families and other stakeholders.

Most people with the inherited disorder that affects red blood cells are of African Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. Of the 120 million people around the world thought to have SCD more than 66% live in Africa. In the U.S. 1 in 13 African Americans have the sickle cell trait meaning their children are at risk of the disorder.

“With Global Blood Therapeutics’ talent portfolio and pipeline now part of Pfizer we look forward to accelerating innovation and expeditiously bringing multiple potential best-in-class treatments to people living with sickle cell disease” Aamir Malik chief business innovation officer and executive vice president at Pfizer said in a company press release.

Oxbryta added to Pfizer’s portfolio of blood disorder therapies

“Pfizer is committed to addressing the underserved needs of the sickle cell disease community. We are excited about these potential breakthroughs and the opportunity to transform the lives of these patients” Malik added.

Among the company’s planned steps is advancing worldwide distribution of Oxbryta (voxelotor) an oral SCD therapy developed by GBT that targets the disease’s root cause. The treatment works by increasing hemoglobin’s ability to bind oxygen helping to prevent clumping and red blood cell elimination. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that is responsible for oxygen transport.

Oxbryta was approved in the U.S. in 2019 for SCD patients ages 12 and older and its use was extended to children as young as 4 in December. It also gained marketing approval in the U.K. for people ages 12 and older in July after being made available for qualified patients there under an early access program.

The therapy has also been approved across the European Union to treat SCD patients ages 12 and older when used alone or in combination with hydroxyurea. Pfizer reports that Oxbryta is also available in Kuwait Oman and the United Arab Emirates for patients ages 12 and older.

In addition to Oxbryta Pfizer acquired GBT’s pipeline of investigational SCD therapies including GBT601 and inclacumab both of which were given orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations in the U.S.

Two ongoing Phase 3 trials are investigating inclacumab an intravenous therapy designed to reduce the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) the painful SCD-related attacks resulting from sickled cells blocking blood vessels. One called GBT2104-131 (NCT04935879) is enrolling up to 240 patients ages 12 and older at sites worldwide including across the U.S. Europe South America and Africa. It is testing whether inclacumab taken every 12 weeks can reduce the risk of VOCs relative to a placebo.

GBT2104-132 (NCT04927247) the other Phase 3 study is testing the ability of a single dose of inclacumab against a placebo to lower the risk of future hospital re-admissions due to VOCs. This global trial is now enrolling up to 280 patients also starting at age 12 who had an index VOC requiring hospital care.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbHlubndvb2R0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9jb3ZpZC10cmFuc21pc3Npb24tMjIxMDExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bombshell: Pfizer Exec admits COVID vaccine never tested on preventing transmissions,"BRUSSELS—During a hearing today on the European Union’s COVID-19 response Pfizer’s president of international developed markets Janine Small admitted that its vaccine had never been tested before its release to the general public on its ability to prevent the transmission of COVID when asked by Dutch politician and a current Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Robert “Rob” Roos.

Janine Small

“Regarding the question around did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market…No.” Small replied with a smirk when asked by Roos if the Pfizer’ COVID vaccine was ever tested to stop the transmission of the virus before it entered the market.

She continued “We have to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.”

It was not clear from the questioning of Ms. Small if she were referring to the Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccine which is authorized under Emergency Use Authorization or Comirnaty which is the FDA-approved vaccine. Under an Emergency Use Authorization vaccines cannot be mandated.

According to the August 2022 article The Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to know it states that there “is modest vaccine impact on transmission” to prevent COVID infection.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the EU implemented a wide range of health policies with its EU Vaccines Strategy and initiatives one being EU Digital COVID Certificates which exempted persons from “free movement” restrictions. The EU implemented “free movement” restrictions to slow down the spread of coronavirus and protect the health and well-being of all Europeans.

Robert “Rob” Roos

EU Parliamentarian Roos exposed an alleged misinformation campaign by Pfizer with the release of his video tweet today. In it he called the actions “criminal” “scandalous” and “a cheap lie.”

Below is a transcript of Roos’ Twitter post:

“If you don’t get vaccinated you’re antisocial. This is what the Dutch prime minister and health minister told us. You don’t get vaccinated just for yourself but also for others. You do it for all of society that’s what they said. Today this turned out to be complete nonsense.

“In a COVID hearing in the European Parliament one of the Pfizer directors just admitted to me at the time of introduction the vaccine had never been tested on stopping the transmission of the virus.

“This removes the entire legal basis for the COVID Passport. The COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society. I find this to be shocking even criminal.”

“This is scandalous. Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that ‘you do it for others.’ Now this turned out to be a cheap lie.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktcGZpemVyLXBmZS10b3AtdmFsdWUtMTM0MDAxMjE0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Pfizer (PFE) is a Top Value Stock for the Long-Term,"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.

Pfizer (PFE)

With eight blockbuster products in its portfolio New York-based Pfizer Inc. boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth. Pfizer markets a wide range of drugs and vaccines. Its business comprises six business units — Oncology Inflammation & Immunology Rare Disease Hospital Vaccines and Internal Medicine. In November 2020 Pfizer spun-off its Upjohn unit its off-patent branded and generic established medicines business and combined it with generic drugmaker Mylan to create a new generic pharmaceutical company called Viatris. The Consumer Healthcare (CHC) segment an over-the-counter (OTC) medicines business was merged with Glaxo’s unit in July 2019 to form a new joint venture (JV). However Glaxo divested the CHC JV into a new company called Haleon in July 2022. Pfizer owns a stake of 32% in Haleon and plans to sell the stake in a disciplined manner.

PFE boasts a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of A and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of Pfizer are trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.5X as well as a PEG Ratio of 0.5 a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 7.8X and a Price/Sales ratio of 2.3X.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy93aHktcGhpbGlwLW1vcnJpcy1wbS1jb3VsZC0xNjEwMDQyMzYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Philip Morris (PM) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report you should consider Philip Morris (PM). This company which is in the Zacks Tobacco industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

When looking at the last two reports this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 12.38% on average in the last two quarters.

For the last reported quarter Philip Morris came out with earnings of $1.48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share representing a surprise of 19.35%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.56 per share delivering a surprise of 5.41%.

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind recent estimates have been moving higher for Philip Morris. In fact the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive which is a great sign of an earnings beat especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Philip Morris has an Earnings ESP of +0.58% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 20 2022.

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

According to a release from American tobacco company Philip Morris International this study has evidenced a growing interest in better alternatives to the traditional cigarette.

It said a third of the doctors also said their patients had asked them in the past 30 days.

The study Communication Between US Physicians and Patients Regarding Electronic Cigarette Use was published by the Journal of The American Medical Association. According to it doctors are significantly more likely to recommend e-cigarettes for heavy smokers while recommending FDA-approved drugs such as nicotine gum for occasional smokers.

""It's important to understand doctors' perspectives on e-cigarettes as a means of harm reduction. As evidence grows showing that e-cigarettes are potentially effective at quitting smoking they may play a critical role in reducing the use of conventional cigarettes and subsequently of diseases caused by tobacco"" said Michael Steinberg author of the study.

Steinberg is the medical director of the Rutgers Tobacco Dependence Program at the Center for Tobacco Studies and division chief in the Department of Medicine at Rutgers School of Medicine.

The release said research results suggest that the more doctors understand that not all tobacco products are equally harmful the more likely they are to recommend e-cigarettes or other smoke-free products to people seeking to quit smoking or being treated for a disease caused by tobacco.

""It is critical to address doctors' misperceptions and educate them in particular by correcting their misperceptions that all tobacco products are equally harmful as opposed to the fact that burnt tobacco is by far the most dangerous"" said lead author Cristine Delnevo director of Rutgers' Center for Tobacco Studies at the Rutgers School of Public Health.

Although progress has been made in reducing smoking in recent decades smoking is still associated with approximately 480000 deaths in the US each year and effective strategies are still needed to reduce this loss.

According to Philip Morris International there are smoke-free products scientifically supported as better options than continuing to smoke since unlike the traditional cigarette they eliminate the combustion process which is the main cause of damage linked to smoking.

It said that in recent years alternative products to cigarettes have been developed such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products aimed at those people who will otherwise continue to smoke.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzYyNjE5L2Nsb3ZlLWNpZ2FyZXR0ZXMtbWFya2V0LXRvLWV5ZXdpdG5lc3MtaHVnZS1ncm93dGgtYnktMjAyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clove Cigarettes Market to Eyewitness Huge Growth by 2028 | Djarum Gudang Garam KT & G,"Clove Cigarettes Market to Eyewitness Huge Growth by 2028 | Djarum Gudang Garam KT & G

Gavin Newsom has called a special legislative session to impose taxes on oil companies for what he says are price-gouging profits but he has yet to offer proof.

As the inimitable Yogi Berra once said it’s déjà vu all over again.

As gasoline prices spiked last week Gov. Gavin Newsom denounced oil companies and called a special legislative session to impose a new tax on their profits.

“Crude oil prices are down but oil and gas companies have jacked up prices at the pump in California. This doesn’t add up” Newsom said. “We’re not going to stand by while greedy oil companies fleece Californians. Instead I’m calling for a windfall tax to ensure excess oil profits go back to help millions of Californians who are getting ripped off.”

Newsom is only the latest governor to promise a crackdown on oil companies when pump prices spike. Over the years there have been numerous investigations into why California’s prices are markedly higher than those of other states but there’s never been any conclusive proof of collusion.

Rather it’s been repeatedly demonstrated that California’s relatively high gas prices are largely if not completely explainable by unique factors such as the state’s particular refining recipe meant to minimize smog-producing emissions its high taxes and its overall high cost of doing business.

More recently California has seen decreasing refining capacity due to the state’s commitment to eliminating gasoline-powered cars and trucks and shifting to “zero emission” vehicles powered by batteries or hydrogen.

Refiners are unwilling to invest in production upgrades when their operations face state-mandated phaseout and as in-state refining declines California is no longer a self-contained fuels island. It becomes increasingly subject to the global commodities market with the disadvantage of requiring specially formulated fuel that cannot be readily obtained from outside sources.

“California policy makers have knowingly adopted policies with the expressed intent of eliminating the refinery sector” Valero vice president Scott Folwarkow told the state Energy Commission in a letter. “California requires refiners to pay very high carbon cap and trade fees and burdened gasoline with cost of the low carbon fuel standards. With the backdrop of these policies not surprisingly California has seen refineries completely close or shut down major units. When you shut down refinery operations you limit the resilience of the supply chain.”

Amy Myers Jaffe managing director of the Tufts University Climate Policy Lab alluded to the decline in refining in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.

“Do I have the new infrastructure fast enough before I retire the old infrastructure and what happens if you’re in the middle?” Jaffe said. “The way we’re doing it now is you just let the fuel costs go up and then we leave poor people with no ability to get anywhere… . And then [California leaders] grandstand against the oil companies — that’s not a solution.”

The Times article pointed out that various authorities have been warning Capitol politicians for years that California needs plans to manage the shift to renewable transportation while maintaining gasoline supplies until they are no longer needed but the pleas went unheeded.

So what will come of Newsom’s special legislative session for a tax on windfall profits? Legislative leaders seem to be lukewarm at best. They know that rounding up two-thirds votes for such a tax would be difficult despite Democrats having supermajorities in both legislative houses especially if Newsom cannot provide rock-solid evidence of oil company malfeasance.

The industry will argue that such as tax would merely be passed on to consumers in even higher pump prices and/or constrict supply even more.

Politicians’ time would be better spent making sure the complex transition from hydrocarbon fuels to renewables isn’t the disaster particularly for poor consumers that Jaffe describes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbmx1aXNvYmlzcG8uY29tL29waW5pb24vZWRpdG9yaWFscy9hcnRpY2xlMjY2NjQ4MjgxLmh0bWzSAUZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zYW5sdWlzb2Jpc3BvLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2VkaXRvcmlhbHMvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NjY0ODI4MS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 67 years operators of oil refinery on the Nipomo Mesa are saying goodbye,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.sanluisobispo.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Gavin Newsom last month signed more than three dozen bills to protect the climate and vulnerable communities from oil drilling and fossil fuel emissions.

The historic climate package includes Senate Bill 1137 which bans new oil and gas wells within 3200 feet of homes schools and any other place people could be harmed by drilling operations. Democrats’ previous attempts to create health and safety zones around oil and gas operations failed in 2020 and 2021 blocked by just a few members of their own party.

Critically the new law includes safeguards for the millions of Californians who live within the roughly half-mile buffer zone of existing drilling operations tightening restrictions on everything from disruptive noise and light to the release of toxic gases from wells and storage tanks. In addition operators must provide regulators with analyses of chemicals in any wastewater transported from existing drilling sites and by January 2027 implement a plan to rapidly detect and fix leaks of noxious gases and the climate super-pollutant methane at these sites.

But the ink had barely dried on this groundbreaking health and safety law when Nielsen Merksamer a lobbying firm that represents several major oil and gas companies filed a referendum to reverse it on behalf of Jerome Reedy a board member for the California Independent Petroleum Association an industry lobby group.

Now the industry and its allies have until Dec. 15 to collect enough signatures (623212 to be exact) to qualify for the next general election. If they do implementation of the law—which was supposed to go into effect the first day of January 2023—will be delayed until voters have their say in 2024.

“I am optimistic that the referendum will not be successful” said state Sen. Lena Gonzalez (D-Long Beach) who authored S.B. 1137. “More than ever before people believe in a carbon- and fossil-free future. And of course we will not give up without a fight.”

The referendum has become a standard tactic in California for well-endowed special interests to reverse progressive gains community organizers say.

“Even if laws are passed fair and square in the legislative process when big industry and big companies don’t like the outcome they choose to try to play by their own rules” said Kobi Naseck coalition coordinator for VISIÓN (Voices in Solidarity Against Oil in Neighborhoods) at the Center on Race Poverty and the Environment an environmental justice nonprofit with offices in Oakland and Delano in the San Joaquin Valley.

The day after oil industry representatives filed the referendum Newsom took the stage in New York City at the Clinton Global Initiative which aims to push action on climate change and other global crises. For all California’s work to chart a clean energy future Newsom told an interviewer the oil industry continues to hold considerable sway over state legislators.

“We may be dominated by Democrats but many of us are wholly owned subsidiaries of the fossil fuel industry” Newsom said. If he hadn’t put pressure on his own party’s lawmakers he added the special interests would have prevailed again.

“They just filed a referendum yesterday Big Oil” Newson said. “These guys aren’t going away.”

A ‘Point of Contrast’

On a sunny Friday in mid-September California state legislators community organizers and environmental justice advocates gathered on Mare Island about an hour’s drive north of San Francisco to watch Newsom sign what his office called among the most aggressive climate measures in the nation’s history.

The location of the signing ceremony—outside a solar-powered federal office building next to an electric-vehicle charging station under arrays of solar panels—was meant to symbolize the transition from California’s past reliance on fossil fuels to a future fueled by renewable energy. “This facility behind you it’s completely powered by the solar you see above you” Newsom said. “What you see behind us is a point of contrast.”

The past he made clear is represented by the oil refineries behind him on the opposite shore including the Phillips 66 San Francisco Refinery which was fined $285000 two years ago for dumping more than 5 million gallons of toxic wastewater into San Pablo Bay.

Phillips 66 is a Nielsen Merksamer client.

Nielsen Merksamer specializes in election law and litigation. The firm has provided legal counsel on more than 400 ballot measures according to its website including Proposition 22 pushed by Uber Door Dash and other app-based companies to exclude their workers from basic labor laws. The measure passed was subsequently ruled unconstitutional last summer and is now under appeal. Most recently Nielsen Merksamer handled referenda for the tobacco and restaurant industries to reverse newly enacted laws banning the sale of certain flavored tobacco products and boosting pay and protections for fast-food workers.

Neither Nielsen Merksamer nor the California Independent Petroleum Association whose board member authored the setback referendum responded to several calls and emails from Inside Climate News.

The newly enacted law represents a hard-won victory for groups that have worked for years to protect communities from the growing list of health problems linked to living near oil and gas drilling: increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases cancer chronic fatigue nosebleeds headaches and birth defects among other serious conditions. The law refers to studies documenting many of these conditions at distances under 3200 feet.

“So many of the families I represent are living near thousands of oil wells” Gonzalez said at the signing ceremony. In Los Angeles County and beyond she said “thousands of oil wells will now be a thing of the past.”

Yet the oil industry has invested tens of millions of dollars over the past three years alone trying to hold on to that past.

A review of lobbying and campaign contribution records curated by the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the industry and its trade groups have spent more than $36.3 million lobbying state regulators and elected officials since 2020. They’ve spent more than $29 million on campaign contributions to influence state and federal political races during the same time when Democrats’ first two attempts to create health and safety zones around oil and gas operations failed.

“It was not easy to pass S.B. 1137 but I am so happy and proud that we did it” Gonzalez told Inside Climate News. “Our frontline communities are tired of the environmental injustice they have been subjected to for years. And yes similar legislation failed in the past but it only made our community voices grow stronger.”



Passing the setback law is the result of a “monumental effort” by the people who are most affected by polluting oil and gas wells in their backyard said VISIÓN’s Naseck. “It really came down to people power in the end and for a concerted group of organizers and organizations and people to say ‘We’re not going to be quiet about this and we’re going to keep fighting for our right to clean air and to live somewhere where oil and gas isn’t polluting our backyard or polluting our kids when they’re at school.’”



Oil companies could relocate oil and gas wells or concentrate them in some of the industry’s “vast oilfields” he said. “Instead they’re willing to spend tons of money wasting taxpayer money to get this on the ballot and try to get their way.”

The safeguards codified in the new law are akin to seat belts or getting lead out of paint and gasoline Naseck said. It’s about public health. But for the oil industry he added “it’s really big business versus the people of California.”

Naturally this action imposes supply flow disruptions that sent prices higher. That also helped create our list of top energy stocks to buy.

Politically the matter imposes significant consequences. Earlier this year President Joe Biden met with Saudi Arabia’s royal family in a bid to raise global oil production. Therefore not only did the Biden administration not get what it wanted the U.S. lost face from the OPEC+ decision. In addition Biden himself faced criticism for ignoring Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations. Thus the backdrop for energy stocks to buy remains contentious.

Still the net impact for the sector should be positive because of inelastic demand at the baseline of consumption. In other words people need to get from point A to point B. So they must consume a minimum of fuel. Irrespective of economic factors then energy stocks to buy should remain holistically relevant.

Below are some important names to consider.

XOM Exxon Mobil $99.17 SHEL Shell $51.28 ENB Enbridge $26.57 DTM DT Midstream $53.47 PSX Phillips 66 $91.40 DK Delek $29.30 ENSV Enservco $1.50

Exxon Mobil (XOM)

One of the top energy stocks to buy is Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) which is a relatively safe choice. A stout company Exxon features a massive fiscal profile covering multiple relevant segments in the oil and gas industry. As a result the company brings to the table a forward yield of nearly 3.5%. It features a 39-year history of consecutive dividend increases so don’t expect that to change anytime soon.

On paper Gurufocus.com rates XOM stock as fairly valued. I’m not going to complain about that though against cynically bullish fundamentals on the horizon Exxon may run slightly undervalued. Its strong points include a robust balance sheet featuring a 0.26 debt-to-equity ratio. This ranks favorably lower than 66% of the energy sector. As well it prints solid metrics in terms of profitability.

Overall analysts carry a favorable view of XOM as one of the energy stocks to buy. Among 11 analysts eight view Exxon as a buy while three view it as a hold.

Shell (SHEL)

Another global giant in the hydrocarbon space Shell (NYSE:SHEL) commands a similar relatively safe profile among energy stocks to buy. Shell gains some props for looking ahead with the company investing in a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands. As well Shell provides a forward yield of 3.85% though it lacks a consecutive dividend-increase history.

Story continues

According to Gurufocus.com Shell features a modestly undervalued business. For one thing the company carries a decently stable balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.06. This ranks favorably below more than 65% of the industry. Second the company features solid profitability metrics. For instance its net margin of 11.2% rates above the industry median of 4%.

Also analysts carry an enthusiastic view of SHEL. Among four experts three of them rate SHEL a buy while the other rates it a hold. The average price target is $66.25 representing 27.5% upside from the price at time of writing.

Enbridge (ENB)

One of the most infrastructurally important names among energy stocks to buy Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is a midstream specialist. This segment of the industry deals with matters such as storage and transportation of critical commodities and resources. Per its website Enbridge operates the world’s longest and most complex crude oil and liquids transportation system.

According to Gurufocus.com ENB rates as modestly undervalued. Although more than a few of its financial figures could use some improvement the company delivers in terms of profitability. For instance Enbridge features an operating margin of 14.2% ranking better than nearly 62% of the competition. As well the company features at least 10 years of profitability providing a canvas of reliability.

Per TipRanks covering analysts feature a consensus moderate buy rating for ENB. Among nine experts six of them view Enbridge as a buy with the others calling it a hold. The average price target is $43.68 representing nearly 18% upside from the time of writing.

DT Midstream (DTM)

Another midstream specialist DT Midstream (NYSE:DTM) is a premier natural gas pipeline storage and gathering provider. Per a recent press release DT Midstream “transports clean natural gas for electric and gas utilities power plants marketers large industrial customers and energy producers across the Southern Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada.”

While the immediate focus on energy stocks to buy centers on crude oil it’s important to realize that global demand shocks tend to impact both oil and gas. Therefore it’s worthwhile to broaden your horizon with DTM.

Per Gurufocus.com the company is heavily oriented toward a growth framework. For instance its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20.1%. This stat ranks better than over 86% of other potential energy stocks to buy. However DT Midstream features slightly less than average ratings for balance sheet stability and profitability.

In other words if you want to gamble a bit regarding energy stocks to buy DTM could be compelling. If not the majors could offer a safer alternative.

Phillips 66 (PSX)

A downstream specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) covers areas such as refining and marketing. Essentially if the product goes into your car it’s downstream. However Phillips 66 also owns midstream assets providing for a balanced approach to energy stocks to buy. As well the company provides a forward yield of 4.19% although there’s only two years of dividend increase history.

According to Gurufocus.com Phillips 66 features a modestly undervalued business. To get the bad news out of the way first the company doesn’t exactly have the greatest growth profile. However a potential increase in demand from further social normalization could benefit PSX stock.

On the positive realm Phillips 66 enjoys solid strengths in the balance sheet. As well it features decent profitability. For instance its return on equity pings at 26.6% rated higher than almost 79% of the competition.

Perhaps best of all Wall Street loves PSX stock. Among 10 analysts eight of them carry a buy rating on the company. The others have a hold rating. Finally the average price target for PSX stands at $116.11 representing almost 26% upside.

Delek (DK)

Another downstream player among energy stocks to buy Delek (NYSE:DK) focuses on refining petroleum. Here the case for DK centers on the speculative notion of strength begetting strength. On a year-to-date basis DK gained nearly 86%. However it’s still down from the peak of this year so some upside room theoretically exists. As well the fundamentals of the OPEC+ cuts may bode well for Delek in profitability terms.

Fundamentally as well DK carries a speculative profile. For instance the company features solid profitability metrics with a return on equity of over 37%. This rates higher than 86% of the oil and gas industry. However Gurufocus.com states that Delek is significantly overvalued on paper. In this case it’s a matter of how much you believe the OPEC+ cuts will positively impact the energy sector.

Historically DK responds well to investor emotions which is why it’s on this list of energy stocks to buy. As a parting note Wall Street is somewhat mixed on Delek. Among 10 analysts five hold a buy rating three have it as hold and two rate it as a sell.

Enservco (ENSV)

Enservco (NYSEAMERICA:ENSV) is one of the top energy stocks to buy on speculation; I repeat for speculation. Priced at only $1.54 at time of writing arguably most experts would label ENSV as a penny stock. Here the narrative focuses on banking on human emotions not dissimilar to the meme-trade argument.

To be clear Enservco shares jumped over 69% so far this year. Thus it’s hardly what you call a complete unknown commodity. At the same time in the trailing six months shares declined 17%. Therefore with the OPEC+ cuts in mind it could swing higher as discount divers target the opportunity.

Nevertheless I must stress again the gambling aspect of Enservco. While the business is relevant – the company provides well enhancement and fluid management services to the onshore oil and natural gas industry in the U.S. – its financials lag. Indeed Gurufocus.com labels ENSV significantly overvalued. However it ranks incredibly high for technical momentum.

If you’re feeling feisty with money you can afford to lose take a look at ENSV. Otherwise the other energy stocks to buy may afford a more reasonable profile.

This election cycle we traveled to Arizona where voters in a month will decide if some of the biggest campaign spenders should have to reveal their true identities. How this ballot measure got there what it hopes to achieve and what opponents say about it provide teachable moments about the so-called “dark money” that can sway elections near you — just like it was meant to do in Arizona in 2014 in a case of mystery money and rising electric bills.

It was early on a Thursday in the home stretch of the campaign season. At Sandra Kennedy’s home the phone wouldn’t stop ringing.

“I finally answered probably about 7:45 and said ‘Jeez you’ve called me three times. What’s going on?’” Kennedy said. “‘Have you seen the TV this morning?’ And I said ‘No.’”

Kennedy was running for a second term on the public utilities commission that regulates power companies — what Arizona calls its Corporation Commission. She checked the TV. “And there was this commercial” Kennedy said. “And I sat on the foot of the bed and went ‘Oh my God.’”

She said the ad cherry-picked from a lawsuit over the franchise for a Denny’s restaurant in which she had a small stake where her husband was chief executive and majority owner a suit later settled. The ad falsely made it look like Kennedy was a cheat or a crook. And Kennedy who is Black saw something else in the ad she found disturbing.

“Each time that ad was shown my face got darker and darker and darker” she said.

The ad seemed to play into racial prejudice. But who was paying for it? At the time there was no way to tell for sure since donors in most states can route their campaign funding through nonprofits that don’t need to give out their donors’ names. Given her support of solar power Kennedy guessed it was someone connected to the monopoly electricity company she regulated called Arizona Public Service.

When Sandra Kennedy ran for a second term on Arizona’s public utilities commission in 2014 she was the subject of an attack ad. She had suspicions about who paid for it. (Alex Schroeder/Marketplace)

She went from first place in the polls 10 points up to second to last once election results were tallied. And two newcomers — seen as friendly to Arizona Public Service — were elected. The five-member commission would then approve an increase in electricity bills to many customers.

“This is definitely not the way the system should work” Kennedy said. “We should be regulating. The utility should not be coming down here telling us what to do and how to do it.”

As for Kennedy her teenage kids implored her to get out of politics. “My son and my youngest said ‘Please don’t do that to us again’” she said.

But after her kids graduated high school Kennedy ran again in 2018 and won. Back as regulator she was determined to get to the bottom of those televised attacks. It took a subpoena from her commission.

Late one Friday afternoon in the early spring of 2019 five white binders — each filled with documents about seven inches thick — finally arrived at the Corporation Commission.

“I probably took three weeks to go through them” Kennedy said. “It was devastating.”

Arizona Public Service spent more than $10 million to influence the 2014 election for who would regulate the power company. But the public didn’t learn that until five years later. (Brian Allison/Marketplace)

They confirmed what Kennedy had long suspected: The source of the money had been not a surrogate not a troll but the electric utility APS through its holding company Pinnacle West Capital. And it was serious money — more than $10 million.

“I stopped adding at $10.2 million” Kennedy said.

The company declined our interview request and referred us to its political participation policy. By 2020 Pinnacle West had a new CEO Jeff Guldner who’d made a promise to regulators.

“I can say that under my leadership Pinnacle West and APS and any of our affiliates will neither directly nor indirectly participate in any election of any Corporation commissioner” Guldner said in an Arizona Corporation Commission meeting in January 2020.

Bob Burns former chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission wants greater transparency in spending on political races. (David Brancaccio/Marketplace)

That was a pledge Bob Burns chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission at the time had demanded. But now Burns wants more than a pledge.

“It’s good as long as [Guldner’s] there but he might go tomorrow” he said.

Burns is a Republican who supported Kennedy a Democrat to get the electric company to fess up. Burns wants those that spend on races to say it out loud.

“You’ve got to have sunlight in the election” he said. “And so if you’re going to spend you need to report so people know who you’re supporting and by how much.”

Voters in Arizona will decide on a measure next month to make those political nonprofits that gather big money disclose the names of their original donors. There are some parameters on this: It applies to political nonprofits that spend $50000 or more on a statewide campaign or $25000 or more on a local campaign. And the original sources would only be made public if they gave $5000 or more.

Terry Goddard a former Arizona attorney general is pushing the measure Proposition 211.

(Alex Schroeder/Marketplace)

“If Arizona Public Service had had to say ‘We’ve read this ad and we support it’ it actually never would have run because they would have been accountable they would have been responsible” Goddard said. “And what dark money does is it separates accountability from the product.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMTAxMTAwNTgwNi9lbi9BbWVyZXNjby1hbmQtQnJpZ2h0LUNhbnlvbi1FbmVyZ3ktSG9zdC1Hcm91bmRicmVha2luZy1DZXJlbW9ueS1mb3ItSyVDNSVBQnBvbm8tU29sYXItYXQtSm9pbnQtQmFzZS1QZWFybC1IYXJib3ItSGlja2Ft0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ameresco and Bright Canyon Energy Host Groundbreaking Ceremony for Kūpono Solar at Joint Base Pearl Harbor ...,"FRAMINGHAM Mass. & PHOENIX & HONOLULU--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ameresco Inc. (NYSE: AMRC) a leading clean technology integrator specializing in energy efficiency and renewable energy and Bright Canyon Energy a leading developer of energy infrastructure hosted a groundbreaking and blessing ceremony for the Kūpono Solar Project on Friday October 7 2022.

This combined solar and battery storage system will be built at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam West Loch Annex in Hawai‘i. Once operational the project is designed to deliver 42 megawatts (MW) of clean renewable energy to Hawaiian Electric’s (HECO) grid on the island of O‘ahu. Attendees at the event heard from U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono Lt. Governor Josh Green and Meredith Berger Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy for Energy Installations and Environment.

Using approximately 131 acres of Federal land the Kūpono Solar Project will feature the installation of a 42-MW photovoltaic solar array and 42 MW/168 MWh (four-hour duration) of lithium-ion battery storage system. The batteries are designed to store solar energy beyond sunset hours enabling the project to deliver sustainable renewable energy to power approximately 10000 homes on O‘ahu. Additionally once fully operational the project is expected to reduce more than 50000 tons of carbon dioxide annually from Hawai‘i’s environment which is the equivalent to offsetting emissions from 12000 cars annually.

“Today we are taking significant strides to strengthen our state’s energy security and resilience and thanks to the ‘Ewa community Navy Hawaiian Electric Ameresco and Bright Canyon Energy we are now steps closer to reaching Hawai‘i’s renewable energy vision of achieving 100% clean energy by 2045” said Lt. Governor Josh Green.“Kūpono Solar is a landmark initiative for us that will not only benefit our state’s economy but will also bolster our sustainability efforts and local communities through stable affordable energy innovative technology and job creation.”

Ameresco and Bright Canyon Energy established a joint venture in 2021 known as Kūpono Solar Development Company LLC to advance the Kūpono Solar Project which is the first project of the joint venture. In support of the Department of Defense’s long-term energy security initiative to increase clean energy reliability and military capabilities and the state’s goals of renewable energy and decarbonization Kūpono Solar has a 37-year land lease agreement with the Navy to provide critical energy resiliency upgrades for O’ahu.

“The Department of the Navy is proud to partner with the Kūpono Solar team and Hawaiian Electric as we enhance mission and community resilience and move purposefully towards Hawaii and Navy’s energy goals” said Meredith Berger Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy Installations and Environment. “This is a great example of climate action building access to clean reliable energy sources inside and outside the fenceline.”

Kūpono Solar will own and operate this solar and battery project under a 20-year power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric. The project will benefit the state’s long-term clean energy transition plan while setting the foundation for Ameresco and Bright Canyon Energy to bring a diversified portfolio of clean energy solutions to Hawai‘i in the future.

“The start of this project comes at a time when the need for consistent energy security and independence is at an all-time high” said Nicole Bulgarino Executive Vice President and General Manager of Federal Solutions Ameresco. “The solar and battery storage solutions that are being implemented will deliver clean renewable energy to the grid and benefit businesses and residents across Hawai‘i.”

“Through our strategic relationships with the Navy Hawaiian Electric and the community we are able to leverage clean technology and infrastructure upgrades to help the state of Hawai‘i reach its renewable energy goals and the Navy achieve its climate and energy resiliency objectives” said Jason Smith General Manager Bright Canyon Energy. “It’s energizing to work with a group of partners committed to bringing this key energy infrastructure to O‘ahu and its residents.”

Construction on the Kūpono Solar Project is expected to be completed in early 2024.

Top Koh Tao Diving Sites

Top Koh Tao Diving Sites

Mango Bay

Located to the north of Koh Tao the area around Mango Bay makes a nice relaxing dive. With depths ranging from 2 to 15 meters its ideal for beginners and snorkelers. Hard and soft coral formations here are plentiful along with a variety of sponges and clams. The bay is only accessible by boat and makes a popular snorkelers day trip. Drop in further around the northwestern tip of the island and drift into the bay area to avoid the crowds.

Sail Rock

One of the more famous Scuba diving sites in the Koh Samui archipelago. It is an iceberg shaped pinnacle that rises from the sandy sea floor at 40 metres and rises 15 metres above the surface. It is a suitable dive site for all levels of diver from Discover Scuba up.

Its surface consists of small patches of hard and soft coral. Common fauna that may be seen include barracuda batfish jacks occasional whale sharks and many other species of tropical fish. The currents can vary considerably but generally are mid to strong. Visibility is usually in the 10-30 meter range. For more advanced divers there is a vertical ‘swim through’ on the northwest side of the rock. Commonly called “The Chimney” it begins at a depth of 18 meters and exits the rock again at depths of 12 and 6 meters. There are no associated fees as yet with diving Sail Rock.

Chumphon Pinnacles

Widely regarded as the Gulf of Thailand’s premier dive sites 5 km Northwest of Koh Tao. The site is comprised of one huge granite pinnacle with some smaller pinnacles rising from the bottom. 40 Meters. Bull Sharks schooling Barracuda. Batfish Giant Gropers Pacific Lionfish occasional Whalesharks.

Southwest Pinnacles

Consisting of seven granite pinnacles ranging from 5 to 30 metres deep and located around 12km off the south west coast of Koh Tao is one of the islands best dive sites. The shallower sections of the pinnacles are covered in anemones whip corals and sea fans. Big groupers and barracudas can often be seen here and you may be lucky enough to spot even larger visitors.

Green Rock

Green Rock offers several small swim throughs caves and crevices where marine life can be seen sheltering. The boulders range in depth from 5 metres down to around 32. There is often a strong current here that you can use to drift around the submerged pinnacles so its not really recommended for inexperienced divers. You will certainly encounter Yellow Margin and Titan Trigger fish here as it forms a popular breeding ground for them … so approach with caution.

White Rock

Two large granite boulders make up the White Rock dive site. An expansive coral garden can be found here at around 10 meters that’s teeming with schools of butterfly fish and angelfish. Blue spotted stingrays are also a common sight on this dive. White Rock is also a popular night dive spot where feather stars and an array of crustaceans can been seen hunting for food.

Red Rock

This Koh Tao diving site is also referred to as Nang Yuan Pinnacle. It starts at around 2 metres and drops to 22. The pinnacle itself is nothing special and the main attractions to this site are the swim throughs. The entrance to the swim through can be found if you leave the pinnacle and head west towards Koh Nang Yuan. This is usually done as a drift dive down to Japanese Garden where you can relax for the safety stop.

Scuba diving in Koh Tao Thailand

Twin Pinnacles

On the far side of Koh Nang Yuan starting at around 5 meters below the surface and dropping to a depth of 18 metres is Twin Peaks or just “Twins”. This is an ideal site for beginners due to its depth and ease of navigation. The rocks are embedded into white sand and there is no shortage of marine life here. A friendly pair of rare saddleback clownfish and be found to the western side of the larger of the Twins.

Japanese Gardens

This dive site is named after the ornate arrangement of coral boulders here. Situated on the east side of Koh Nang Yuan and with depths ranging from 2 to 12 meters it is suitable for snorkelers & beginners. Plenty of staghorn and plate coral can be observed in the shallows. A popular drift dive can be done from Red Rock through a series of swimthroughs and emerging into Japanese Gardens for a relaxing safety stop amongst the myriad coral formations.

Hin Wong Pinnacle

Situated on the east side of Koh Tao is Hin Wong Pinnacle. This site comprises several large granite boulders covered with sea fans and whip corals as well as filefish shrimpfish coral grouper and many other reef fish. You may encounter the resident Green Turtle if you’re lucky. The summit is a tabletop rock formation within about 10 meters of the surface and the maximum depth at Hin Wong is around 32 meters.

Laem Thien Pinnacle

Laem Thian Pinnacle is a great rocky dive site near Mao Bay full of swim throughs caverns and small caves. There are a few steep walls with some predators hunting for smaller prey. Some excellent white soft coral and sea whips can be admired along the wall at depths between 18 and 5 meters. It is possible to combine this cave dive with the beauties of shallow reef diving inside Mao Bay or Aow Mao.

Shark Island

Named after its resemblance to a dorsal fin Shark Island is a twin rock outcrop situated to the southeast of Koh Tao. Each side of the islet offers a different array of marine life and features making it almost two sites in one! On the east side you’ll find myriad soft corals gorgonians and sponges while the west offers hard coral formations that are home to moray eels nudibranchs sting rays and the odd Leopard shark. Titan triggerfish can be very aggressive here so approach with caution. Maximum depth at this site is 25 metres.

Unicorn Wreck

It was rumored at the time of sinking in 1989 that the Unicorn was sunk on purpose as an insurance scam. The 60 meter long cargo vessel was reported to have a hold full of expensive tuna fish which turned out to be inexpensive dog food hence the nickname it later acquired – the “dog food” wreck. Lying around 12km off Mango Bay and in 50 meters of water it is also a technical diving site. Still mostly intact with the majority of the obtrusive fishing nets now removed some penetration is possible. The wreck is now home to some big red snappers and patrolling groupers.

Torpedo Wreck

The Torpedo is a 70 meter Japanese cargo vessel sitting upright in around 55 meters of water an hour north of Koh Tao she sank in the mid 1970’s. Due to the depths involved this has been classified a technical dive for experienced divers only. There are three areas of penetration however visibility is usually poor at depth. The deck is at 45 meters and the cargo holds are still full of teak logs with a few scattered on the seabed.

Huge profits suggest not,"Industry executives told Congress last April that oil prices had to be at a certain level for them to make money drilling new wells. For Devon Energy it was “slightly above $30” per barrel. ExxonMobil said $35. BP’s number was $45. Chevron estimated “about $40.” Shell and Pioneer Natural Resources agreed on $30.

The answers were somewhat surprising given that a Dallas Federal Reserve study taken only days earlier had found a larger sample of oil companies needed prices to be at $56 per barrel before drilling was profitable. A year earlier survey respondents had reported an average of $52 per barrel. The survey results suggested that drilling costs rose only about 8% between 2021 and 2022—roughly on pace with overall inflation—even as oil prices ballooned by 69%.

What can we learn from all this? First large producers claim to have much lower breakeven points than the industry as a whole. (Our research into ExxonMobil has called this idea into question.) Second and more importantly executives claim that oil and gas drilling costs have increased only modestly yet oil company revenues have skyrocketed resulting in huge profits—ultimately at the expense of the consumer.

Across regions average breakeven prices to profitably drill a new well vary. The Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico offers relatively low breakevens. According to the Dallas Fed survey the Permian’s Delaware sub-basin edged out the Midland region (another Permian sub-basin) as the host to the lowest average breakevens in the Permian. Delaware breakevens stood at $49.74 per barrel in 2022 just 1% higher than the prior year.

ExxonMobil and Chevron large operators in the Delaware pointed to productivity gains and investments in front-end infrastructure such as a central processing facility and centralized tank batteries that mitigated the worst effects of inflation.

In the Dallas Fed survey responses we saw oil and gas executives complain about rising costs and supply chain woes: Labor shortages scarce equipment oilfield service fee inflation and so on. Yet somehow the woes barely factored into the industry’s estimates of drilling costs.

There’s an obvious conflict here. On the one hand oil and gas executives protest bitterly about rising costs. But when it comes to reporting breakeven prices they claim they’ve been largely successful in defying inflationary pressures.

In their most recent quarterly earnings conference calls executives from both Chevron and ExxonMobil discussed their outlook on inflation. Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said “on the onshore U.S. we have seen cost inflation in the single digits. We have been able to mitigate a part of that through good planning smart procurement and good relationships with suppliers.” Kathryn Mikells ExxonMobil’s chief financial officer said executives feel “really good about how we are managing inflation to date. Our overall structural cost savings kind of plan and program is very much on track.”

Perhaps this confidence is overblown. The oil and gas industry initially was slow to acknowledge the effects that supply chain disruptions would have on their operations. Now cognitive biases such as optimism bias or anchoring to projections could be bending their cost estimates downward.

If this is another case of oil and gas executives being slow to recognize a key financial trend then watch out for future financial results from the oil patch. Delaware Basin producers in particular have the most room for upward adjustments to their breakeven estimates for profitability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEwLTEwL3VrLXMtdHJ1c3MtZG9lc24tdC13YW50LXNvbGFyLXBhbmVscy1idWlsdC1vbi1mYXJtbGFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK's Truss Doesn't Want Solar Panels Built on Farmland,"Why did this happen?

Source: Klaus Vedfelt/Digital Vision via Getty Images

The shift to remote work is killing demand for office space and setting up a potential meltdown in the commercial real estate market over the next decade.

The average office occupancy across 10 major U.S. cities tracked by Kastle System was at about 47% at the end of September less than half what it was pre-pandemic and just a marginal increase from the 36% occupancy rate U.S. offices were seeing a year ago when many believed a significant return to the workplace was imminent. The number of workers returning to the office appears to have plateaued and in some cities office occupancy rates have barely budged from where they were at the end of 2021 when the omicron wave of the coronavirus upended many companies' return-to-office plans.

Companies are shrinking their footprints leaving older dated spaces and driving up vacancy rates in major cities as American workers continue to resist calls to return to the office. The absence of downtown workers has become a crisis for cities that rely on full offices for property tax revenues and patronage of shops and restaurants and the problem will likely worsen as lengthy lease agreements begin to end.

""This is not just a temporary shock due to the pandemic"" said Howard Chernick an economics professor at Hunter College. ""This is a long-term adjustment.""

Workers also want to be even more remote than they are now. A survey from the second quarter of 2022 by 451 Research found that 82% of employees want to work at least some of the week remotely including more than 27% who wanted to be entirely remote.

Many of the workers returning to offices are doing so only on a part-time basis. That will keep demand for office space lower post-pandemic said Gus Faucher chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group.

""Some businesses are trying to push back against this but workers have more bargaining power now than they did and businesses that try to force workers back into the office full-time will find themselves at a disadvantage"" Faucher said.

New York impact

New York City will be among the hardest hit as plummeting demand for office space destroys $453.6 billion in commercial real estate value in coming years according to a new working paper from New York and Columbia universities. The decline could be even worse if workers choose to stay home at similar or higher rates than they are now.

""There is a 'worse case' scenario in which remote work sticks around for even longer than expected"" said Arpit Gupta a finance professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and one of the paper's co-authors in an email.

A recent survey of 160 major Manhattan office employers found that while only 16% of office workers are fully remote just 9% are in the office five days per week. By January 2023 12% of workers will be fully remote but only 11% will be in the office full-time according to the survey from the Partnership for New York City.

The U.S. office vacancy rate was 17.6% in the second quarter of 2022 while the vacancy rate was 21.6% in downtown Manhattan according to Cushman & Wakefield a commercial real estate services company. Prior to the pandemic the national vacancy rate was 13.5% and downtown Manhattan was 11.4%.

The shift to remote work has drawn concern from big city mayors and business leaders. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been an outspoken critic of remote work saying that the city's economy is being drained by a lack of office workers.

'Fiscal doom loop'

Office assets are typically financed with debt which remains on bank balance sheets and in commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolios. That means substantial declines in commercial real estate value would severely harm institutional investors and overall financial stability. Property taxes from commercial offices and adjacent retail spaces would plunge affecting local government revenues.

""A decline in office and adjacent retail real estate valuations may activate a fiscal doom loop that lowers the quality of life for residents and worsens the business environment"" the NYU and Columbia paper states.

Still rental rates continue to rise with the national average rising to $37.03 per square foot in the second quarter up 9% from pre-pandemic rates according to Cushman & Wakefield.

Some investors continue to prosper. Office real estate investment trusts or REITs which make up only a small fraction of the U.S. commercial real estate market have not seen a significant decline in occupancy rates. And rental rates for office REITs are on the rise climbing to $50.30 per square foot in the second quarter up 10% from pre-pandemic rates according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

Those figures signal that companies are moving to higher-end properties which have been more successful than older lower-end units at leasing out the majority of their space. Companies may be moving to smaller nicer offices as part of efforts to reduce their footprints while luring workers in with more attractive workspaces.

""By contrast lower quality office stock appears to be a more substantially stranded asset given lower demand raising questions about whether these assets will ultimately need to be repurposed towards other uses"" the Columbia and NYU paper states.

This trend may not truly flourish until later this decade as many commercial office leases expire. More than 60% of current U.S. office REIT leases will not expire until after 2027 according to Market Intelligence data.

Big cities hit

As those leases expire rental prices will decline and cities could be devastated said Chernick with Hunter College: ""The question then becomes: What happens to cities?""

The answer to that question will differ depending on city size.

Chernick recently co-authored a study that found that larger cities are hit more severely since they have a higher concentration of workers in the sectors most likely to work remotely: finance; information; professional scientific and technical services; and management. Up to 80% of employees who work in these four industries can work from home Chernick said.

Chernick found that San Francisco was the most vulnerable American city to the economic hit caused by the shift to remote work followed by New York Boston and Atlanta.

Smaller cities with fewer of these remote jobs will be less impacted. A commercial real estate crisis may be brewing in San Francisco and New York but not in Shreveport Louisiana or Las Cruces New Mexico.

A lasting trend

A commercial real estate collapse may be inevitable as the shift to remote working seems to be part of the trend in American labor from farm to factory factory to office and now office to home said James Bianco president of Bianco Research.

""Workers need to gather with co-workers but the current model is no longer working"" Bianco said. ""The office is going the way of the farm and factory when it comes to Americans' attitudes about work.""

Still the trend could reverse. Office space once leased by tech or finance firms could draw interest from universities or medical centers. In addition if economic conditions deteriorate further workers may abandon their plans to continue working from home Faucher with PNC said.

""A severe recession could lead to a return to the previous balance of power in the labor market with firms demanding that workers come into the office and workers complying because they're worried about getting laid off"" Faucher said.

Market Trends Drivers Restraints Competitive Analysis Player Profiling Regulation Analysis

Water treatment has long been acknowledged as essential. Sanitation in particular has been identified as a method for preventing communicable diseases. However those in charge of pool and equipment maintenance have recently recognized the importance of mineral saturation or ""water balance"" as it is more commonly known. Water can corrode pools and become aggressive or it can scale and degrade the pool with mineral deposits.

Swimming Pool Chemicals Market Growth Factors

Increasing number of swimming pools in developing nations

Robust demand for residential swimming pools

Growth in swimming sports and recreational activities





Swimming Pool Chemicals Market Dynamics

Some of the major factors leading in the swimming pool chemicals market that are bolstering demand in the coming years are an increase in the number of fitness enthusiasts an increase in swimming as a recreational activity and an increase in the number of swimming sporting events. Because they have witnessed the effects of chlorination on their eyes and nose most people are aware that chlorine is commonly added to pool water to keep swimming pools clean. Pool owners are aware that in addition to chlorine several other parameters affecting pool water quality must be monitored and controlled: pH water hardness total alkalinity and total dissolved solids. To assist pool owners pool wholesalers sell a wide range of chemicals and test materials. The pool operator must learn how to use chemical agents for sanitation as well as how to manage pH total alkalinity and calcium hardness. The operator is in charge of both the swimmers and the pool.

The Impact of COVID-19 on the Swimming Pool Chemicals Industry

The COVID-19 pandemic had the most devastating effect on the swimming industry. Almost all public pools closed in 2020 but the closure was extended until 2021. Swimming pools were the last to reopen while other indoor sports activities were gradually reopened. Furthermore many countries' governments have allowed swimming pools to operate at half capacity in each batch. Furthermore in many countries only those who had been vaccinated were allowed to use the pool. As a result sales of swimming pool chemicals plummeted during the pandemic.

The rising number of residential construction projects boosts the global swimming pool chemicals market revenue

The ongoing residential construction recovery in leading European countries the United States China India and several other countries around the world is a positive growth factor for swimming pool construction. Furthermore an increase in the number of international tourists and a thriving tourism industry supported by higher income and tourism spending are expected to boost hotel output. As the world's population grows so will the demand for residential infrastructure. This is expected to increase the number of swimming pools assisting the swimming pool chemical market to thrive.

We had the opportunity to catch up with Troy to conduct an informal exit interview on the Pool Magazine podcast.

(Pool Magazine) PM: So are congratulations in order Troy are you officially retired right now?

(Troy Franzen) TF: I am officially retired right now as we speak. This is my first week at home where I’m not looking at my phone every five minutes. It’s a different feeling but yes it’s kind of official as we speak.

PM: That’s terrific. 12 years with the company was a real achievement. You’ve had a great run and some big milestones with Fluidra. You were with them a long time can you talk to us a bit about your experience with them?

TF: It was fantastic. I look back and twelve and a half years seem like it’s flown by. The last three years as we know kind of put time into a different kind of context.

PM: What changed in your life while you were president of Fluidra?

TF: What changed in my life? Oh boy. Well when I started with this company I had three young children. Now twelve and a half years later I have three adult children that are almost all through school or working in post-grad school and so that’s made me proud. That’s been a big change in my life. I’ve learned a ton about certainly the industry our company and the pool business. It’s been a pleasure along the way.

Franzen played an important role in the transition from Zodiac to Fluidra

PM: We know you played a significant role in the transition from Zodiac to Fluidra. I mean you were there at the very start. Can you talk to us a bit about that and some of the other acquisitions mergers and changes that you saw happen during your time with the company?

TF: In 2010 I would say that we were then owned by Carlyle Private Equity. We were under the label of the company name Zodiac Pool Systems. If you go back and think about what occurred leading up to that time period with the housing market and of course the great recession that took place it was a dramatic time frame not only for the industry but for our company.

The company changed dramatically as the economy kind of took a turn for the worse. A lot of under-investment or no investment or stripping of costs was taking place when I came on board. I would say the company was a little bit rudderless and lacking in direction. It needed some investment in key areas like customer service and quality and sales. It was a difficult time but on one hand it was nice to come in when things were at the bottom. There was only one way to go with that.

Bruce Brooks our current CEO and I were of like mind having worked together in the past. We set our sights on building a great company and not thinking about the short term and not thinking about flipping the company. We started thinking about building out a brand. Building out a quality infrastructure. Putting together a sales and customer service strategy that was focused on the customer. Y’know? Really saying ‘Hey what do we want this company to be today?’ That was twelve and a half years ago and the results speak for themselves.

PM: You’ve had a few big milestones over the last couple of years. Taylor Technologies SR Smith CMP. There are some big acquisitions there.

TF: If you can go back before that we weren’t doing a ton of acquisition work early on because we were still building out the foundation and fundamentals. We bought a company called Savi Lights years ago. Nicheless LED technology had some early quality challenges but that acquisition kind of put us into the lighting category. We went on to buy a small company called Grand Effects which kind of got us into that high-end decorative fire and water feature space.

When the pandemic kicked in was when a lot of companies kind of went into hiding or thought things were going to turn really bad. Not only did the market start to turn for the good but Fluidra doubled down. The board gave us a lot of support not only financially but gave us the leeway to go get aggressive.

We started with CMP custom molded products out of Atlanta which kind of got us into a different vertical of spa OEM products which we’re excited about. We also expanded our offering with alternative sanitizers white goods and some other products that fit in nicely with our Jandy and Polaris bundle. Then we moved on and bought eventually bought S.R. Smith up in Oregon. That got us into a lot of the deck equipment like slides rails diving boards and then also allowed us a nice baseline of business to expand the commercial portfolio. Wrapping up with Taylor Water Technologies out of Maryland. It’s been a nice little bolt onto the family.

PM: These are some tremendous milestones. Troy now that we’re getting to the point in our conversation where we’ve got to ask you what made you decide to take this moment to retire?

TF: Oh boy I don’t know that there was one AHA moment. I always said I wanted to retire early and I was naive enough to say when I was 21 that I’m going to retire when I’m 50. In fact I missed my goal. I’m a little bit late but I always wanted to take time to do the things that I want to do; while I could do them on my own schedule. I love sports so to use a sports analogy I didn’t want to go out on a low. I didn’t want to get carried out off the field on a stretcher and I wanted to make it my decision.

Fluidra had this incredible run of success. I would lie if I didn’t say the last couple of years have been incredibly rewarding but they also have been challenging and especially when you throw the acquisition work on top of just the day-to-day heavy lifting that took place to service our customers.

It was time to take a break. I think late last year Bruce and I started talking about succession planning. As a public company one of our jobs is to be stewards for the future not just for now. How do you have a successful transition of power? So I said I’m ready to take a break let’s start thinking about a handoff. That’s kind of when this started almost about ten months ago. I know it kind of just was recently announced but in fact in my mind the plan has been going on for some time now.

PM: Lennie Rhodes is going to be moving into your role. His previous role was CEO for Big Ass Fans. I saw he was VP at Husqvarna and before that Director of Marketing for Electrolux. This kind of unexpected move of bringing in a company outsider to the role what was the strategy behind that decision to look outside the organization?

TF: Well some people may call that an unexpected move or unconventional move but I actually came from outside the industry when I came on. He’s got an incredible background. I think if you look at the companies he’s worked for he’s worked in very similar kinds of channels and industries that we’re dealing with. Working through distribution is in his background. So I think Bruce thought that that was an important aspect. We wanted someone that would bring a new perspective and diversity of ideas if you will. I think that’s why we landed on Lennie. I’m pretty excited. I spent a lot of time with him and in fact I think the company is going to be in fantastic hands.

PM: Usually when there’s a change at the top there’s a lot more change coming. What does the change in leadership look like for the rest of the executive organization as well as the rank and file of Fluidra North America?

TF: People have asked what I’m proud of leaving behind. I think that’s the leadership team we have in place at Fluidra. Twelve years ago we were always kind of the green inexperienced kind of rudderless management team. We have turned the corner and I would say over the last seven years there’s been kind consistent solid leadership and a strategic plan. We’ve been a stable group in the industry. I’m very pleased and proud of the team we have in place. We’ve got a really solid stable mature executive leadership team and frankly I don’t anticipate any changes in leadership.

PM: Lennie Rhoades is stepping in at a particularly challenging time. What advice as parting president were you able to offer Lennie about what obstacles lie ahead?

TF: I started in 2010 so I kind of started I don’t want to say a similar time period but because I don’t think what’s going on now is going to have the same curve or the same kind of decline that occurred in 2008. Certainly we are in a period of softening. We can debate whether we’re in or heading toward a recession but I think the fundamentals are sound. My advice to him has been don’t overreact. Don’t do anything in the short term that will impact a business that’s really stable.

Of course he’ll have his own leadership style and he’ll have his own approaches but I advised not to let the short-term media cycle or what’s going on with the economy affect what’s a pretty good organization with a good strategy. Stay the course. Look for ways to improve. Look for ways to drive more efficiency and unique ways to go to market. But don’t overreact to a short-term economic downturn.

PM: What are your plans now? What involvement if any do you plan to maintain with Fluidra as you exit the organization?

TF: On a personal note I plan on taking a break traveling with my wife and spending some time with my three grown children. I’d love to get involved with volunteer charity work in my community. I do intend to help Bruce and the board and the leadership team in any way possible.

If there’s any future consulting or outside work that they need help; I don’t know maybe it’s due diligence or looking at any future acquisitions. I’ve kind of signed on to help as any special projects come along and in the very short term plus help Lennie steer the way. Any questions he has or any doors he needs to open I’m happy to help because it’s in my and everybody’s best interest to.

Y’know I think the best has yet to come from the company. Although there’s a little bit of a soft spot in the economy the future is really really bright and I think you’re going to see big things out of Fluidra in the future.

But that isn’t the case for the Canadian Halal Financial Corporation’s customers.

Thomas Lukaszuk a former cabinet minister and one of the founders of the Canadian Halal Financial Corporation says they’re still seeing dozens of applications filter in each week. “We launched this program on December 24 2021” he says. “On December 25 we had 167 applications filed.”

The reason for the Edmonton-based company’s ongoing success is that they’re catering to the underserved Muslim community.

Under Islamic law Muslims aren’t allowed to accept or pay interest—the act is considered exploitative. That makes it difficult for a Muslim person to buy property. Financing options tend to be limited to traditional lenders such as banks who charge interest and use the money obtained through mortgages to invest in businesses that don’t align with Islamic tradition such as cannabis shops and alcohol manufacturers.

As a result many Muslims are left looking for an alternative. “Our clients are medical doctors lawyers people with very high incomes but they’ve never had enough disposable cash to buy a house. So either they’re renters they have entered into informal arrangements with family members they borrow money from each other or they pool money until one family buys a house” Lukaszuk says. “But it’s very laborious and extremely time consuming to do that.”

Looking to solve this problem representatives from the Al Rashid Mosque in Edmonton the first Mosque in Canada approached Lukaszuk in 2019 to discuss the possibility of introducing mortgages that did not involve interest.

Lukaszuk had worked closely with the community during his time as a politician and had since been involved in building projects familiarizing him with the mortgage industry. With over a million Canadians identifying as Muslim it was clear to Lukaszuk that there was a need for trustworthy Halal financing.

Lukaszuk and his partner John Stainton a lawyer and businessman spent the next two years working with the Al Rashid Mosque to iron out the details of acceptable financing. According to Lukaszuk the group spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees ensuring the mortgages could be upheld in Canadian court. The group even travelled to Al-Azhar University in Cairo Egypt—one of the oldest Islamic universities in the world that plays a key role in overseeing Middle Eastern banks—to receive a pronouncement saying that the company was 100 per cent compliant with Islamic law.

Other Halal financing companies do exist in Canada but few are as regulated as the Canadian Halal Financial Corporation. Each financing contract is audited by a religious committee who certifies that the transaction is compliant.

When an application comes in the Canadian Halal Financial Corporation calculates the profit it expects to make on the transaction. It then adds that number to the principal and divides the amount among a certain number of monthly payments. This way the monthly payments don’t fluctuate as they would with interest rates.

The borrower must also pay a minimum of 25 per cent of the property’s market value or purchase price up front and show that they have good credit history and sufficient income to afford the monthly payments.

To ensure the transaction is halal the company doesn’t allow any third parties to enter into the contract. “We are the lender so there are no secondary contracts and there are no insurances on our mortgages” Lukaszuk says.

Rather than borrowing from banks all of the money used for the mortgages comes from the Canadian Halal Financial Corporation’s own resources including investments in pension plans and private wealth funds. Each investment is reviewed by a committee of Islamic finance scholars to ensure that it’s compliant.

Providing Halal loans has made a significant difference to the community. In 2012 Nadeem Rahman a member of the Al-Rashid Mosque moved his family from the Greater Toronto Area to Edmonton so that his kids could get a better education. With no Halal loans available he was forced to rent.

“I searched a lot” Rahman says. “I saw that there was an organization in Manitoba providing Halal mortgages but not in Alberta at all.”

Rahman’s family was living in a neighbourhood close to the mosque and his kids’ school but it wasn’t ideal. Rahman laughs when he says he always wanted a house with an attached garage. “The weather here is crazy” he says referring to the winters. “As you age it’s very difficult to go out clean your car and then take your family out.”

When the Canadian Halal Financial Company launched it opened doors for Rahman. He secured a mortgage and moved his family into a detached home with a double garage.

He’s thankful to the company but he hopes it continues to expand offering loans on other things such as cottages campers and cars. “There are a lot of people who want to buy something but they still can’t do it” he says.

Lukaszuk is well aware. While the company deals primarily with principal residence mortgages he says over the next year the company plans to expand across Canada and start offering financing for all types of properties including cottages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYW5na29rcG9zdC5jb20vbGlmZS9zb2NpYWwtYW5kLWxpZmVzdHlsZS8yNDExMjIwL2ZpbmQtZXZlcnl0aGluZy1mcm9tLWdhbWluZy1jaGFpcnMtdG8tZ2lhbnQtcG9vbC1mbG9hdHMtYXQtdGhlLW5ldy10b3BzLWNsdWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Find everything from gaming chairs to giant pool floats at the new Tops Club,"Tops Club Central Retail Corporation's first membership store recently opened on Rama II Road behind Central Rama II boasting an expansive list of imported goods from the US Japan South Korea Australia and New Zealand for everyone in the family.

Tops Club is perhaps the closest thing to Costco that you can experience in Thailand with all the very tall shelves filled with seemingly endless supplies of goods in a warehouse setting.

From its sheer size of 15000m² Tops Club may look intimidating but it's simply divided into three main zones each offering different types of goods. Mind you I'm not going to list all 3500 products in five categories that are available or else we'll be here all day.

The highlights from Zone A include toys electronics gadgets pet costumes gaming chairs (which costs B1 shy of 176000 baht) giant pool floats (in case you want to open your own waterpark) barbeque grills and camping gear. Zone B is dedicated to food galore with many tasting stands and a huge room for fresh fruit and vegetable. Sip free coffee before you go find your new favourite snack. Zone C is packed with even more food but focuses on fresh meats seafood bakery and alcoholic beverages. The cafe cashiers and exit await at the end of the zone.

As per the membership store concept you can't just simply pick stuff up and pay for them at the cashier. As a prerequisite you'll have to apply to either be a normal or a premium member. You can sign up for the former for free in a jiff with the help of the helpful staff but the latter grants you 5% discounts on all items (except alcohol tobacco and electronics) and perks but comes with an annual fee. Both types of membership also let you earn The 1 points.

Until Oct 31 premium membership costs B799 instead of B999. It may sound steep but it comes with besides the discount dedicated cashiers reserved parking space and free delivery with no minimum purchase until Dec 31 for an address in Bangkok and adjacent provinces. There are desks set up for shoppers to sign up for a membership at the entrance and near the exit.

Tops Club Rama II opens 10am-10pm on weekdays and 8am-10pm on weekends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwcmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuaW4vbXVtYmFpL211bWJhaS1ibWNzLW9ubGluZS1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLWdldHMtb3ZlcndoZWxtaW5nLXJlc3BvbnNlLWVhcm5zLXJzLTM1LWNyb3Jl0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlZXByZXNzam91cm5hbC5pbi9hbXAvbXVtYmFpL211bWJhaS1ibWNzLW9ubGluZS1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLWdldHMtb3ZlcndoZWxtaW5nLXJlc3BvbnNlLWVhcm5zLXJzLTM1LWNyb3Jl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mumbai: BMC’s online membership gets overwhelming response earns Rs 3.5 crore,"Mumbai: BMC’s online membership gets overwhelming response earns Rs 3.5 crore | FPJ

The online membership for swimming pools made available by the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation has received an overwhelming response from the citizens.

Around 4500 residents have registered themselves for the civic-owned swimming pool. It has also earned more than Rs. 3.5 crores through online membership.

Earlier membership in a civic-run swimming pool could be obtained only once or twice a year by waiting in queues and filling out forms physically.

The citizens would have to stand in queues since early morning and membership would be granted only on a first-come-first-serve basis. They would then again have to queue up to submit forms. To ease this process the BMC started online bookings from August 23.

In the first phase the online service has been made available at Mahatma Gandhi Olympic pool in Dadar General Arun Kumar Vaidya Olympic pool in Chembur Sardar Vallabhai Patel Olympic pool in Kandivali and Shri Mrubali Devi pool in Dahisar.

“We will be allowing membership to 6000 people in the first phase. In the last 40 days 4500 citizens have taken membership. Also we have now increased the duration of swimming by 15 minutes to an hour "" said the senior civic official.

The BMC is also planning to keep swimming pools open from morning 6 to 12 noon and in evening from 6 to 10 pm. Earlier the BMC would allow daily membership to citizens which was closed for some time.

The civic body is also planning to restart the facility. While earlier the pools could conduct only six batches now they have provision for 12 batches. The swimming pools which were closed to the public during Covid pandemic reopened on February 1."

ALLENTOWN Pa. Oct. 10 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- PPL Electric Utilities is proud to announce it has won a pair of Achievement Awards from the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies (AEIC). The awards recognize revolutionary innovations to PPL Electric's wooden utility pole inspection process and its application of a distribution settings automation tool that increases the safety reliability and efficiency of its electric grid. Both awards were presented on October 6 at the 2022 AEIC annual meeting in Scottsdale Arizona.

Pictured (from left to right) are: PPL Electric Utilities Project Manager Eric Resch PPL Electric Utilities Vice President of Distribution Operations Sal Salet and PPL Electric Utilities Support Engineer Arun Doodnauth.

""Becoming one of the top utilities in the country doesn't happen overnight"" said PPL Electric Utilities President Steph Raymond. ""It takes innovation and a questioning mindset. That's what allows us to continue to find new ways of doing things and breakthroughs in processes in non-traditional places. These awards are perfect examples of our continuous drive to innovate on behalf of our customers.""

For researching and implementing a technological leap in wooden utility pole inspections PPL Electric was awarded the AEIC President's Award the organization's highest recognition. Using resistance drill-based wood pole inspection technology PPL Electric ran three pilot programs to map the extent of the condition for external decay then developed and tested a new drill bit design along with software improvements to automatically calculate the exterior and interior decay.

This comprehensive resistance drill-based inspection — which is unique to PPL Electric — has improved detection of pole failures and decay as well as reduced the cost and duration of inspections. What used to take a five-person crew a week to complete can now be accomplished in just two days with a two-person crew. The increased inspection efficiency allows PPL Electric to be more responsive to emergent needs and achieve annual inspection goals faster more accurately and at a lower cost.

PPL Electric also received an AEIC Achievement Award for its work in implementing an adaptive Distribution Protection Analysis Toolkit (DPAT) that automates processes and increases the safety reliability and efficiency of the electric grid.

Through a supported partnership PPL Electric used Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) DPAT to create an automated system that develops and routinely checks settings on its distribution network. This enables the overall system to work more efficiently and helps avoid unnecessary disruptions in service that could be caused by incorrect settings.

In addition the tool can identify gaps in settings as well as in system design and configuration to clear potential faults from the system. This helps prevent safety risks to employees customers and the public.

""AEIC is proud to recognize PPL Electric Utilities with two awards this year for projects that significantly improve utility operations in key areas"" said AEIC CEO Steve Hauser. ""Their unique approach to pole inspection leadership and innovation in power system analysis is improving operational efficiency exponentially.""

As reported by Fred Bernstein for Architectural Record Murphy plans to open his own design studio and has also accepted an endowed chair at the Georgia Institute of Technology where he currently teaches. The nonprofit has not announced immediate plans to fill the president and CEO role.

Senior principals and managing directors Patricia Gruits and Christian Benimana will lead MASS Design Group from its Boston and Kigali Rwanda headquarters respectively in Murphy’s absence. Also continuing in his leadership role is Chief Design Officer Alan Ricks who cofounded the nonprofit alongside Murphy Marika Shioiri Clark and Alda Ly in 2008 with the mission to “research design build and advocate for architecture that promotes justice and human dignity.”

Fifteen years on MASS Design Group (MASS is short for Model of Architecture Serving Society) is comprised of a globe-spanning multidisciplinary team of more than 200 architects landscape architects designers engineers builders researchers writers filmmakers and other creatives hailing from more than 20 countries. In addition to Boston and Kigali MASS Design Group operates studios in Santa Fe New Mexico; Bozeman Montana and Murphy’s hometown of Poughkeepsie New York.

From its bustling Kigali outpost MASS Design Group operates the largest architecture firm in Rwanda employing over 80 people including the country’s first female landscape architect. Also based in the Rwandan capital city is MASS.Build a construction offshoot that employs over 2000 people and the African Design Centre an intensive 20-month fellowship program established in 2018 that serves as a complement to traditional architecture and design school education.

“I am grateful for the opportunities Michael created which allowed us to demonstrate the power of architecture in creating a more just and beautiful world” said Ricks in the announcement of Murphy’s departure.

As Murphy steps away from the organization he cofounded MASS Design Group is involved with 60 current global projects including $250 million in the construction and pre-construction phases. In addition to the receiving the coveted AIA Firm Award in 2022 other awards and accolades bestowed to MASS Design Group include a Cooper Hewitt National Design Award (2017) and Arts and Letters Award (2018).

The nonprofit has also participated in the 2019 Chicago Architecture Biennial and the 2018–2019 cycle of Exhibit Columbus and was recently a shortlisted contender to design Canada’s forthcoming LGBTQ2+ National Monument in Ottawa. Completed stateside projects include an inclusive health clinic in North Texas (its first healthcare project in the United States) the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery Alabama and a traveling exhibition entitled the Gun Violence Memorial Project. MASS Design Group is also working with Fort Worth Texas nonprofit Transform 1012 to envision the transformation of a former KKK lodge into an inclusive arts and community hub. “We are inspired by the possibility of using design to help transform a symbol of hate into a symbol of healing” Justin Brown principal at MASS Design Group told AN of the project.

Said Murphy a graduate of the University of Chicago and the Harvard Graduate School of Design in a statement shared by MASS Design Group:

“Founding and leading MASS has been the privilege of a lifetime. I look forward to continuing my service on the MASS Board of Directors and supporting its mission partners and projects in that role. And I am excited to begin the next chapter of my career including not only working with the wonderful students at The Georgia Institute of Technology where I have accepted the Thomas W. Ventulett III Distinguished Chair but also launching a new venture which will focus on sharing the financial ownership of our built environment more equitably.” Most importantly I want to thank everyone at MASS every single member of the team each of whom fearlessly made an important idea into a reality. Nothing can supplant the hard work of our dedicated employees who are evangelists of how the built world can be shaped to improve the lives of individuals every day.”

AN will circle back when we learn more about Murphy’s next chapter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMzI2NTUvbWF6YXJzLWluLXRoZS11cy1hcHBvaW50cy1waHVvbmctZ29tYXJkLWFzLXByaW5jaXBhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mazars in the US Appoints Phuong Gomard as Principal,"Mazars a leading audit tax and advisory firm today announced that Phuong Gomard Partner at Mazars in the UK is joining the US as a Principal.

Rail News: MOW

By Michael Popke

No industry it seems has been able to escape supply shortages of late. Including the wood segment of the crosstie business. As the Railway Tie Association noted in its midyear purchases report “production continued in its declining trend though the rate of decline slowed down.”

Wood-tie producers have struggled to procure ties as hardwood lumber — such as grade lumber wood for flooring and pallet stock — has been the preferred sawing solutions for sawmills said RTA Executive Director Nathan Irby in an email.

“Accordingly wood-tie production has been marginalized and with railroad purchases outpacing product inventory levels are quite low” Irby said.

The good news? Since June sawmills have increased their tie-cutting production throughout the United States. The bad news? Production is still slightly stunted due to labor inconsistencies supply-chain disruptions for parts and equipment and trucking woes Irby said.

“I postulate railroad wood-tie demand will be strong for the next 12 to 18 months as tie inventories are too low production has grossly under-paced purchases and the constrained sawmill output cannot satisfy the needs before that window of time” he said.

Irby declared 2023 will be “a big year for producers” — especially if winter does not bring record rainfall.

Wood-tie suppliers and treaters tend to agree. Progressive Railroading recently reached out to a sampling of them to gauge their take on 2022 developments and their outlook for the year to come. Edited versions of their emailed responses follow.

Koppers Inc.

Koppers: Surviving 2022’s ‘stress test’

Sales are up so far this year for Koppers Inc. Demand for the company’s wood ties remains solid and the supplier is optimistic about future growth opportunities based on longer-term market trends said Koppers Director of Class I Sales John McDonald.

“As we turn the corner to the second half of 2022 we are seeing market pricing stabilize and procurement activities tracking at a much healthier pace” he said adding that Koppers is expanding capacity to meet growing demand. “We are very excited about our state-of-the-art treating facility in North Little Rock Arkansas which will be fully operational by year’s end.”

Additionally Koppers is trying to aggressively evaluate all opportunities to expand its North American footprint. For example McDonald points to the evolution of Koppers Recovery Resources a division that recovers used ties at the end of their useful life and converts the material into a renewable fuel source.

Meanwhile Koppers Railroad Structures has garnered attention from railroads seeking cost-effective repair methods while minimizing traffic interruptions.

“As supply challenges continue to be resolved we are well positioned to provide the treating time necessary to meet the growing demand for crossties” McDonald said. “As a vertically integrated supplier of creosote Koppers offers surety of supply in order to serve our customers in the most effective manner. All signs point to a strong 2023 for an industry that has been put through the stress test of 2022.”

Stella-Jones: Implementing robotic stackers

Stella-Jones Inc.

Supply-chain issues impacted Stella-Jones Inc.’s procurement of green ties needed to refresh the company’s air-dried inventories said George Caric the company’s vice president of marketing.

“Sawmill production has been negatively impacted by post-COVID issues involving labor high fuel prices and supply chain issues regarding parts and equipment” he said. “The past 18 months have been really hard on our producers with labor and fiber shortages. We are just starting to see tie production pick up in most areas.”

Coinciding with the uptick Stella-Jones continues to seek ways to ensure it has ties available.

“We are working with the University of Tennessee looking at borate-treated yellow poplar as a good species for ties” Caric said. “Yellow poplar is abundant but not as strong as some of the mixed hardwoods being used [for ties]. However dipping in borate and air drying has proven to strengthen the wood and [make it] capable of being used in low-density lines.”

The company also claims to be the first in the wood-tie industry to install robotic tie stackers in plants to help reduce accidents; the plan is to eventually install the stackers at all Stella-Jones tie-treating facilities Caric said.

Meanwhile Class I tie demand has remained strong all year with particular interest in pre-plated bridge ties — a market segment Caric predicts will remain strong for at least the next couple of years in part because of the time-saving installation process.

“We hope to see a big finish to the year in terms of green production and [building] back our air-dried inventories” he said. “The demand is there; there are many projects on the books for new business as companies look to put more business on the railroads.”

Nisus: Double-digit growth in treatment usage

Nisus Corp.

Demand is strong in the wood preservation industry too. Nisus Corp. officials are reporting increased use of both the company’s Cellu-Treat® dip treatment prior to air seasoning as well as QNAP® copper naphthenate during the pressure treatment of crossties and bridge ties. They’ve also noted “a steady uptick” in the use of the BTX® Bridge Tie Treatment System to dual-treat green bridge ties with Cellu-Treat and QNAP said Ken Laughlin Nisus’ division vice president for wood preservation.

“We have continued to increase our production of QNAP copper naphthenate oil-borne preservative and Cellu-Treat a liquid disodium octaborate tetrahydrate” he added. “There are also two new treatments plants that have begun dip-treating with Cellu-Treat before air-seasoning in 2022 and we’re anticipating that an additional two plants will begin pressure-treating ties with QNAP by the end of the year.”

Meanwhile Nisus officials are excited about a new application method that involves remedial treatment of bridge ties in the field with borate.

“By drilling reservoirs into bridge ties that have already been laid we’re able to fill them with Cellu-Treat and then seal those reservoirs with BTX plugs” Laughlin said. “Those reservoirs allow borates to diffuse through the wood and add that protection against corrosion decay and insect damage that borates are so well-known for.”

Like Stella-Jones Nisus also has worked with University of Tennessee researchers conducting strength testing on borate-treated yellow poplar ties.

“When it became clear that the railroads and sawmills were struggling with green tie supply issues during the first stages of the pandemic we began researching alternatives that could help alleviate those pressures for our railroad customers” Laughlin said. “We found that when yellow poplar ties were dip-treated in Cellu-Treat before air seasoning the resulting ties were stronger than untreated gum ties.”

All of these found expression in the South and especially in Atlanta.

The history of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States has gained a certain cachet with organizers and policymakers. Divestment  pioneered and popularized by liberation activists to weaken the South African apartheid regime is now being applied to climate change and Israel. The South frequently gets left out of this history — yet in Georgia and elsewhere below the Mason-Dixon line anti-apartheid activism was a vital issue.

In 1985 Atlanta Georgia was one of the nerve centers of opposition to apartheid South Africa in the United States. The branch of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was coordinating a national boycott against Coca-Cola  led by Thandi Gcabashe the daughter of African National Congress (ANC) leader Albert Luthuli. Activists in the city and at Georgia’s universities were fighting for divestment while the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was working with mine unions to picket investor meetings. And progressive civil rights leaders like Georgia state legislator Julian Bond the founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee were locking horns over divestment with moderate counterparts like Andrew Young the mayor of Atlanta.

The Struggle in the South

The American South figures into some of the earliest episodes of anti-apartheid sentiment in the United States. In the mid-1950s when South Africa was unfamiliar to many Americans Martin Luther King Jr expressed admiration for the leader of the ANC Luthuli. By 1962 King endorsed a full boycott of South Africa and continued to speak out until his assassination in 1968. Members of the American Committee on Africa discussed Atlanta as a possible site to jump-start organizing in the South. Still organizing remained scattered and small scale.

That began to change in the 1970s when events like the 1976 Soweto uprising dispelled the myth that black South Africans accepted apartheid and starkly revealed the system’s brute violence. In Atlanta opposition to apartheid sprouted in several different places but it invariably converged around the issue of US businesses in South Africa. Faith-based activism came from the SCLC: it coordinated protests against the sale of South African krugerrands and with the United Mine Workers against the Southern Company importation of South African coal.

The AFSC had an office in Atlanta and it too assumed a leadership position in coordinating among different groups to support sanctions and boycotts. The participation of South African exiles like Gcabashe who led the office’s South Africa program gave the program dedicated and experienced leadership. It achieved fame nationally for launching a boycott of Coca-Cola Atlanta’s most well-known corporation. The Atlanta office also helped support AFSC’s “Peace Tours” — educational speaking tours that informed audiences about the connections between US militarism and the arms industry. The sojourns frequently covered the South in part because of the number of weapons manufacturers in the region.

But the central fight for anti-apartheid activists was over divestment and sanctions. Targeting individual companies was too slow and boycotts of South African goods while powerfully symbolic did little to damage the South African economy writ large. Convincing churches universities and public pension funds to divest from South African companies became one of the central campaigns for apartheid opponents. The fight was led by the Georgia Coalition for Divestment in South Africa and supported politically by Bond.

While conservatives around the United States opposed divestment and generally supported maintaining ties with South Africa in Atlanta disagreement over apartheid exposed divisions between veterans of the civil rights movement. Atlanta mayor Young who had been elected in 1981 and previously served as Jimmy Carter’s ambassador to the United Nations was strikingly moderate and deeply anti-communist.

Young opposed apartheid but did so from the perspective that the vicious system was driving South African toward Marxism. He saw US businesses as a force for good in South Africa. Under Carter Young had shared his fellow Georgian’s preference for enlisting multinational corporations to engage in charity in lieu of fighting for sanctions; he opposed them even in the wake of the Soweto uprising and the 1977 murder of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. In doing so Young drew on his own lessons from the civil rights movement — namely that winning over whites was key and had to be carried out cautiously.

As mayor Young supported divestment but always from the assumption that continuing to invest in South Africa was bad business. His preference was for symbolic action such as prohibiting South African Airways from using Atlanta’s airport; he continued to express support for voluntary corporate action and believed that South Africa’s business community was the best agent to end apartheid. Atlanta’s city council was the major driver behind the divestment of the city’s pension fund; Young played a hands-off role.

Bond’s approach was different. He used his office to fight for state-level divestment and lobbied Georgia’s Republican senator Mack Mattingly to vote for sanctions. Bond succeeded in the latter — Mattingly voted to override Ronald Reagan’s veto of the 1986 Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act — but was less successful in the statehouse. Despite putting up bills every year Bond never got his desired state-level divestment.

One likely reason was Coca-Cola. The powerful company kept the divestment campaign at bay by making African American businessman Carl Ware an executive vice president at the company its strategist and public face on South Africa. Ware played hardball going so far as to contact public institutions about employees who were speaking out on the issue. Gloria Gaines one of the cochairs of the Georgia Coalition for Divestment recalled that Ware reached out to her bosses at the Atlanta transit authority about her activity. Coca-Cola’s influence was so pervasive that SCLC prohibited its staffers from attending anti-Coke rallies.

By the mid-1980s Coke decided to announce a watered-down divestment solution: they agreed to sell their bottling operations in South Africa to black investors. Young and the city’s newspapers publicly applauded the decision but activists noted that Coca-Cola retained the right to sell syrup to the new bottling operations leaving them with the exact same market share. As AFSC and the Georgia Coalition maintained their boycott Coca-Cola continued to escalate its PR campaign — even persuading leading South African figures like Desmond Tutu to serve on the board of an “equal opportunity fund” to burnish company credentials.

The movement had made deep inroads and apartheid would fall less than a decade later with Nelson Mandela’s election. But Coke that all-American company showed how to resist demands for change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVldGhlbWFya2V0cy5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvYXBsZC1wZ3ItZHB6LWNtYy1wZXAtZWFybmluZ3MtcHJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,APLD PEP PGR DPZ CMC: Earnings Preview,"Read on for some of the key earnings reports to look out for in the week ahead:

Building on CRG’s success developing over $1 billion of new industrial projects annually and strong track record with its first two logistics funds USLF I and II CRG plans to expand its real estate strategy to include the acquisition of existing industrial assets. The recently hired team was instrumental in building Duke’s industrial portfolio throughout the U.S. and will leverage CRG’s existing national platform to acquire critical supply-chain assets located in core port-of-entry markets and high-density population centers.

The new hires include Mark Crawford former senior vice president and head of acquisitions at Duke who joins CRG as chief investment officer; Joe Hawkins former senior vice president legal and deputy general counsel at Duke who will serve as a senior vice president of portfolio management for CRG’s investment management platform; and Isaac Lau former vice president of acquisitions at Duke who will serve as vice president of acquisitions for CRG’s Western Region. Crawford and Hawkins will split their time between CRG’s new Indianapolis office and its Chicago headquarters while Lau will join the firm’s SoCal office.

At Duke where Crawford had worked for the last 16 years he was responsible for executing the firm’s national acquisitions strategy which transformed the publicly traded REIT from a diversified Midwestern firm into a national pure-play industrial REIT with a leading tier one market presence. During his tenure Crawford also directly led Duke’s largest-scale acquisition in the firm’s history along with its largest regional acquisitions in Northern New Jersey Miami Seattle and Southern California. At the close of the merger the total portfolio comprised 160 million square feet of projects across 19 major logistics markets.

At Duke since 2011 Hawkins played a significant part in all major transactions which repositioned Duke into the industrial REIT it became. Hawkins was also instrumental in growing the company’s West Coast portfolio from less than 5 million square feet in 2016 to nearly 30 million square feet at the time of close after executing approximately 150 acquisition and development transactions.

Lau joined Crawford’s acquisition and development team over a year ago after an extensive search for an experienced acquisitions professional to lead the REIT’s investment activities on the West Coast. Throughout his career in real estate investments and investment banking he has closed more than $1 billion of total transaction volume. At Duke Lau successfully sourced and executed $420 million of acquisitions representing over 1.2 million rentable square feet of logistics assets in high-growth industrial markets across the country.

CRG will continue to leverage the strength of its nationally recognized industrial brand The Cubes to attract Fortune 500 companies from the distribution logistics e-commerce manufacturing food and beverage cold storage aerospace aviation pharmaceutical and laboratory sectors. The firm’s market-leading building specifications and unmatched locations are carefully selected with consumer-centric supply chain strategies offering superior access to logistics networks and robust and qualified labor.

Details were disclosed on Tuesday by industrial cybersecurity firm Claroty whose researchers have been looking into ways to achieve native code execution on programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2022-38465 and it has been rated ‘critical’. Siemens has announced the availability of fixes for affected PLCs and the TIA Portal in one of its Patch Tuesday advisories.

Siemens has also released a separate security bulletin highlighting the vulnerability. According to the company in 2013 it introduced asymmetric cryptography into the security architecture of its Simatic S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPUs in an effort to protect devices customer programs and communications between devices.

However due to the lack of practical solutions for dynamic key management and key distribution for industrial control systems (ICS) at the time it decided to use a built-in global private key for protection.

Siemens has confirmed the findings of Claroty researchers admitting that the cryptographic key is not properly protected. An attacker could launch an offline attack against a single PLC and obtain a private key that can then be used to compromise the entire product line for which the key was obtained.

The attacker can then obtain sensitive configuration data or launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that enable them to read or modify data between the PLC and its connected HMIs and engineering workstations.

Claroty researchers said they obtained the private key by exploiting an arbitrary code execution vulnerability they discovered in 2020 (CVE-2020-15782) which gave them direct memory access. They have shown how an attacker who has the private key could gain full control of a PLC and conduct MitM attacks.

“Siemens is not aware of related cybersecurity incidents but considers the likelihood of malicious actors misusing the global private key as increasing” Siemens warned.

The industrial giant has made significant changes to address the issue with a unique password being set for each device and communications now being protected by TLS 1.3.

The company has released firmware updates but noted that updating the firmware on a device is not sufficient.

“In addition the hardware configuration in the TIA Portal project (V17 or later) must also be updated to the corresponding CPU version and downloaded to the PLC” it told customers.

Overall 72% of firms that responded to the survey reported using or developing ML applications. These applications are becoming increasingly widespread across more business areas. This trend looks set to continue and firms expect the overall median number of ML applications to increase by 3.5 times over the next three years. The largest expected increase in absolute terms is in the insurance sector followed by banking.

The largest expected increase in absolute terms is in the insurance sector followed by banking. ML applications are now more advanced and increasingly embedded in day-to-day operations. 79% of ML applications are in the latter stages of development ie either deployed across a considerable share of business areas and/or critical to some business areas.

80% of respondents that use ML say their applications have data governance frameworks in place with model risk management and operational risk frameworks also commonplace (67%). Firms consider that ML presents a range of benefits. Currently the most commonly identified benefits are enhanced data and analytics capabilities increased operational efficiency and improved detection of fraud and money laundering.

Currently the most commonly identified benefits are enhanced data and analytics capabilities increased operational efficiency and improved detection of fraud and money laundering. Respondents do not see ML as currently used as high risk. The top risks identified for consumers relate to data bias and representativeness while the top risks for firms are considered to be the lack of explainability and interpretability of ML applications.

The top risks identified for consumers relate to data bias and representativeness while the top risks for firms are considered to be the lack of explainability and interpretability of ML applications. The greatest constraint to ML adoption and deployment is legacy systems. The difficulty integrating ML into business processes is the next highest ranked constraint.

The difficulty integrating ML into business processes is the next highest ranked constraint. Almost half of firms who responded to the survey said there are Prudential Regulation Authority and/or Financial Conduct Authority regulations that constrain ML deployment. A quarter of firms (25%) said this is due to a lack of clarity within existing regulation.

1: Introduction 1.1: Context and objectives Over the past few years the use of machine learning (ML) has continued to increase in the United Kingdom (UK) financial services sector. As with other technologies ML can bring a range of benefits to consumers firms markets and the wider economy. Many firms are already realising these benefits and deploying ML applications across various business lines services and products. However ML can also raise novel challenges (such as ethical issues) and amplify risks to consumers the safety and soundness of firms and even potentially financial stability. That is why it is important regulatory authorities monitor the state of ML deployment and ensure they understand the different use cases maturity of applications benefits and risks. In 2019 the Bank of England (Bank) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted a joint survey to gain an understanding of the use of ML in the UK financial services sector. One of the key findings was the need for further dialogue between the public and private sector to ensure the safe and responsible adoption of ML. The Bank and FCA established the Artificial Intelligence Public-Private Forum (AIPPF) in 2020 which explored various barriers to adoption and challenges related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI)/ML as well as ways to address such barriers and mitigate risks. This survey builds on the 2019 survey the AIPPF final report and the wider domestic and international discussion about the use of ML in financial services (in which the Bank and FCA have been active participants). In publishing the findings the Bank and FCA demonstrate their commitment to monitoring the state of ML deployment improve their collective understanding and support the safe and responsible adoption of ML technology in UK financial services. This joint Bank-FCA report is the result of the analysis of the responses to the 2022 survey. This includes in relation to the firms that responded to the survey: a quantitative overview of the use of ML;

the ML implementation strategies of firms;

the share of ML applications developed in-house or by third-party providers;

approaches to the governance of ML;

respondents’ views on the benefits of ML;

respondents’ views on the risks of ML;

perspectives on constraints to development and deployment of ML; and

a snapshot of the use of different methods data safeguards performance metrics validation techniques and perceived levels of complexity of ML. The report closes with a selection of ML case studies describing a sample of typical use cases including: Insurance pricing and underwriting.

Fraud prevention and anti-money laundering (AML). 1.2: Methodology In total 168 firms received the questionnaire and 71 submitted responses (42% overall response rate). The Bank surveyed 48 dual-regulated firms 17 firms applying for Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) authorisation as a deposit-taker and eight Bank-regulated financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and received 51 (70%) responses. The FCA surveyed 95 FCA-regulated firms and received 20 (21%) responses. The Bank selected firms with the aim of surveying each type of FMI and PRA-regulated firm and covering a significant share of those firms. It also included several firms that are small in terms of their market share but were considered to be advanced in the use of ML and therefore of interest for horizon-scanning purposes. In addition the sample included a number of FCA-regulated small-sized firms who were undergoing the PRA authorisation process for deposit-taking permissions. The FCA sent the survey to a representative list of firms from the following sectors: credit referencing agencies crowdfunders custody services exchanges fund management alternatives lifetime mortgage providers multilateral trading facilities non-bank lenders principal trading firms wealth manager and stock brokers wholesale brokers credit brokers debt purchasers debt administrators consumer credit providers motor finance providers retail finance providers payment services and e-money issuers. It also included firms who responded to the 2019 survey. Overall the combined sample is skewed towards larger firms with no responses received from smaller fintech firms or start-ups. While firms may be more likely to respond to the survey if they are already using or developing ML the sample can be seen to provide a broad representation of firms by types of activity size and areas of ML applications. However the sample and survey findings should not be seen as representative for all types of firms or the entire UK financial services industry. The results presented in this report are anonymised and aggregated with the respondents grouped into the sectors listed in Table A. Table A: Sector classification used in the survey and report Sector Type of firms included Banking Building societies international banks retail banks UK deposit-takers Insurance General insurers health insurers life insurers personal and commercial lines insurers Non-bank lending Credit brokers consumer credit lender non-bank lenders Investment and capital markets Alternatives asset managers fund managers wealth managers and stockbrokers wholesale brokers Financial market infrastructures (FMIs) payments and other Credit reference agencies e-money issuers exchanges financial market infrastructures multilateral trading facilities Sources: Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. All charts in this report are based on data received from respondents from this survey. When designing the survey the Bank and the FCA considered the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 principle that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent and proportionate.

Box A: Definitions of ML application algorithm and model ML is a methodology whereby computer programmes build a model to fit a set of data that can be utilised to make predictions recommendations or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so instead learning from sample data or experience. There are many different approaches to the implementation of ML which include techniques such as supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. For the purpose of this survey this excludes simple linear regression – which we define as any regression techniques that does not employ subset selection methods shrinkage methods or dimension reduction methods. ‘ML application’ refers to an entire system including data collection feature engineering model engineering and deployment. It also includes the underlying IT infrastructure (eg virtualisation data storage and integrated development environment). An ML application could include multiple models and algorithms. Respondents were asked to classify ML applications separately if they fulfil different business purposes or if their set up/components differ significantly. The term ‘algorithm’ means a set of mathematical instructions or rules that especially if given to a computer will help to calculate an answer to a problem. Whereas the term ‘model’ means a quantitative method system or approach that applies statistical economic financial or mathematical theories techniques and assumptions to process input data into output. The definition of a model includes input data that are quantitative and/or qualitative in nature or expert judgement-based and output that are quantitative or qualitative. In ML an algorithm is a procedure that is run on data to create a model.

2: Machine learning adoption and use 2.1: Financial services firms use an increasing number of ML applications The number of ML applications used in UK financial services continues to increase. Overall 72% of firms that responded to the survey reported using or developing ML applications. This compares to 67% of respondents to the 2019 survey although it is worth noting the sample size and composition was different to the 2022 survey. Similar to 2019 respondents from the banking and insurance sectors have the highest number of ML applications. Chart 1: 72% of firms that responded already use or are developing ML Respondents expect this trend to continue with the overall median number of ML applications expected to increase by over 3.5 times over the next three years. This increase is in line with the trend reported in the 2019 survey. The largest expected increase is in the insurance sector with the median number of applications per firm expected to increase by 163%. Chart 2: Median number of ML applications expected to increase by over 3.5x 2.2: Deployment stage ML applications pass through a number of development and deployment stages. The survey asked firms to report the number of applications they have at each of the five key stages: (i) proof-of-concept or experimental (ii) front-line research and development and/or used for benchmarking existing models (iii) pilot and/or used in small share of business area (iv) deployed across considerable share of business area and (v) critical to business area. From the survey responses 79% of ML applications are in deployment (Chart 3). In particular 65% of applications are already deployed across a considerable share of business areas with a further 14% of ML applications reported to be critical to the business area. Although the survey question was somewhat different in 2019 a significantly higher proportion of applications were in pre-deployment stages then 44% in 2019 versus 10% in 2022. This suggests the survey respondents’ ML applications are more advanced and increasingly embedded in day-to-day operations. Chart 3: Overall 80% of ML applications are in deployment or critical stages Banks insurance and FMIs payments and other firms broadly have a similar split between the different stages of deployment (Chart 4). Non-bank lenders have the highest percentage of ML applications (42%) that are critical to business areas with just 3% of applications in pre-deployment. At the other end of the scale respondents from the investment and capital markets sector have the largest number of ML applications in the pilot or small share of business stage and no critical applications. Chart 4: Non-bank lenders have the highest percentage of ML applications in deployment 2.3: Range of applications across sectors and business areas In terms of the range of ML use cases (Chart 5) firms are developing or using ML across most business areas. As with the 2019 survey ‘customer engagement’ and ‘risk management’ continue to be the areas with the most applications and account for 28% and 23% of all reported applications respectively. The ‘miscellaneous’ category which included business areas like human resources and legal departments had the third highest percentage of ML applications (18%). The business areas with the fewest ML applications are ‘investment banking’ (0.9%) and ‘treasury’ (0.4%) with the latter also being the business area with the fewest ML applications in the 2019 survey. Chart 5: Over half of ML applications are in customer engagement or risk management In terms of maturity of ML applications by business area (Chart 6) ‘customer engagement’ (97%) has the highest percentage of post-deployment applications. The areas with the highest proportion of ML applications at the pre-development stages are ‘investment banking’ and ‘treasury’ with 58% and 40% respectively. It is worth noting that treasury (40%) and credit (34%) are the areas with most ML applications rated as ‘critical to business area’. The business areas with no critical ML applications are ‘investment banking’ and ‘asset management’. Chart 6: Treasury and credit have the most ML applications that are critical to the business area 2.4: Internal versus external implementation and cloud computing The survey asked firms about the number of ML applications that were implemented internally compared to the number of applications that were implemented externally by third-party providers (ie applications where the majority of the development or deployment actions were implemented by a third party). However the line between ‘internal’ and ‘external’ implementation is becoming increasingly blurred. This is because ML systems are becoming more complex and rely on a mix of internal and external components (data inputs ML models software packages cloud computing storage etc). For example firms may develop models and code algorithms internally but use third-party data sets or base their algorithms on third-party cloud computing platforms. While the 2020 Bank survey on the impact of Covid on ML in UK banking suggested an increase in outsourcing and use of external vendors this is not reflected in this survey. Instead 83% of respondents develop and implement ML applications internally at their firm. This is in line with the 76% figure reported in the 2019 survey. Investments and capital markets is the sector of respondents with the largest use of third-party ML applications (39%). Chart 7: Investment and capital markets have the most externally implemented ML applications The survey also asked about the number of ML applications that are run on cloud computing platforms (Chart 8). Overall 18% of ML applications are run on cloud computing platforms. While this is in line with the 22% reported in the 2019 survey there are marked differences for particular market segments. In particular insurance firms reported that nearly three quarters (74%) of their applications run on cloud computing platforms compared to 39% of investment and capital markets firms 11% of non-bank lenders and 8% of banks. The percentage of insurance ML applications run on cloud computing platforms in this survey is also significantly higher than the 31% reported by insurers in 2019. Chart 8: Almost three quarters of insurance firms' ML applications run on the cloud The survey also asked firms which third-party providers they used for data models and cloud computing services. As Chart 9 shows there was a wide range of data and model providers. However there is a degree of concentration in cloud service providers with the top two providers accounting for 75% of firms that use cloud services (and the top provider accounting for 43% of firms that use cloud services). Chart 9: Little diversity in cloud providers with top provider named by 43% of respondents

3: Strategies and governance 3.1: Firms’ ML strategies The 2019 survey found that some firms were already thinking about ML strategically mostly in the banking and insurance sectors. This trend has continued and expanded to other sectors. The majority of respondents in the 2022 survey (79%) had some form of strategy for the development deployment monitoring and use of ML (Figure 1). In terms of the sector breakdown by respondents 100% of insurance firms had a strategy as did 83% of non-bank lenders 78% of banks 70% of investment and capital market firms and 60% of firms in the FMIs payments and other category. Survey respondents tend to use different elements of existing strategies sometimes combining multiple approaches or elements into one to support their use of ML. For example 38% of respondents have a model risk management (MRM) strategy that incorporates ML and 25% of survey respondents include ML as part of their wider data innovation or technology strategy. Elements of firms’ wider governance frameworks are used as part of the overall ML strategy as are ethical principles such as those related to fairness or bias in decision-making. Respondents also explained how they operationalise the strategies. 29% of firms have specific teams that are responsible for the development and deployment of ML within the firm. These often consist of cross-functional teams that allow ML models to be deployed across multiple business cases within the firm. Sometimes these teams are also responsible for monitoring ML model risks and outputs. Many of the firms that do not use ML report that it is not a priority given the size scope or focus of their business. Figure 1: Percentage of respondents with overall ML strategy and strategy elements 3.2: Firm ML governance and accountability Good governance is essential for the safe adoption and use of ML in financial services. Governance underpins effective risk management across the ML lifecycle by putting in place the set of rules controls policies and processes for a firm’s use of ML. Furthermore governance ensures accountability for ML applications and is vital for ensuring that ML is used in a safe and responsible manner. The survey asked firms which governance elements and frameworks they employ (Chart 10). As with firms’ strategies for ML many respondents use existing governance frameworks (such as MRM and operational risk management) to address the use of ML. As noted below 80% of respondents say that they have data governance frameworks in place. Just over two thirds of respondents (67%) have AI/ML specific principles guidelines and standards in place as part of their approach to ML governance. This may reflect the fact that ML can pose novel challenges to financial services firms and therefore may need specific governance principles to address them (as noted in the AIPPF final report and governance meeting minutes). Chart 10: 80% of firms have data governance frameworks in place for their ML applications 3.3: Lessons learnt from ML deployment The survey asked respondents about the main lessons learned from the deployment and use of ML applications within their firms including how to integrate these lessons into the broader approach to ML development. The most common lesson respondents highlight is the need for good and effective governance frameworks (such as MRM). In particular respondents mentioned clear lines of ownership of the ML application within the business to allow for effective risk management. Respondents also emphasise the importance of continuous reviews and assessments of ML applications to ensure the outputs are accurate and fair. This includes assessing potential bias in decisions that may affect consumers. Respondents also said it is key to know when best to retire and replace ML models. Respondents noted that understanding ML models and their outputs are also essential elements of ML explainability and transparency. Some respondents highlighted the need for clear metrics to assess what constitutes a successful outcome for a ML application and suggest setting a framework and baseline metrics to measure the impact of ML applications. Survey respondents noted that well-trained teams are crucial for the effective implementation and monitoring of ML applications. Respondents reported that cross-functional multi-disciplinary teams tend to be the most effective at developing and deploying ML applications that are safe and responsible. Survey respondents also mentioned the importance of comprehensive staff training and culture to ensure the safe and responsible adoption of ML.

4: Benefits risks and constraints 4.1: Benefits risks and trade-offs The use of ML can bring benefits to consumers firms and the wider financial system. For consumers ML can create more personalised products and services as well as better customer engagement. Firms can benefit from improved data analytics and increased operational efficiencies. These benefits can in turn aggregate to the financial system and the economy as a whole. However the use of ML in financial services can also amplify existing challenges and risks. Many of these challenges and risks can be traced to three underlying drivers and stages of the ML lifecycle: (i) data (ii) models and (iii) governance (Figure 2). For example historical biases in data sets and poor-quality data can feed into the modelling and cause subsequent model risk. ML techniques can also increase model complexity and lack of explainability as well as other forms of model risk. Although effective governance and accountability are key mitigants of those risks weak and ineffective ML governance can exacerbate the issues and be a challenge in itself. Figure 2: Stages of ML lifecycle Source: Artificial Intelligence Public-Private Forum. While there are many trade-offs in considering the adoption and use of ML one could expect to find a correlation between the perceived benefits and the perceived risks of using ML namely that greater risk would be associated with greater benefit. However the survey responses show no significant association between average perceived risk and average perceived benefit (Chart 11). Chart 11: No significant association between perceived risk and perceived benefit 4.2: Benefits now and in three years This survey suggests that benefits are the most likely in relation to enhanced data and analytics capabilities increased operational efficiency and improved combatting of fraud and money laundering (Chart 12). All benefits are expected to increase over the next three years with the greatest increase expected to be in better personalisation and improved customer engagement. Chart 12: All categories of benefits are expected to increase over the next three years 4.3: Risks and mitigants Overview As mentioned above the primary drivers of ML risk in financial services relate to interconnected risks at the data level which feed into the model level and then raise broader challenges at the level of the firm and its overall governance of ML systems. The survey asked respondents to rate the level of various risks related to those three drivers as well as any specific risks to consumers regulation and other risks such as cybersecurity and outsourcing risk. Overall respondents consider the current levels of risk to be low to medium across all risk categories and expect this to stay at similar levels over the next three years. While the highest perceived risks are for consumers respondents consider risks related to ML models rather than data or governance as the highest risks for firms (Chart 13). Chart 13: Overall levels are low to medium across all risk categories The survey also asked firms to identify specific risks within each of the categories. Respondents said the lack of explainability in both the workings and outcomes of ML applications are a key risk which can lead to both inaccurate consumer outcomes and subsequent reputational and legal risk to firms. A further risk many respondents highlighted was the potential risks associated with data quality structure and bias issues. More than half of firms (52%) noted that the use of ML causes concern about potential ethical and bias issues arising. The respondents noted that these issues can have a negative impact on consumers’ ability to use products and services. This can in turn damage the firm’s reputation and lead to operational costs service breakdowns and other negative consequences. In addition respondents highlighted outsourcing risk which can include issues around third-party compliance with firms’ governance and data sharing frameworks. Overall respondents consider the top ML-related risks to be: biases in data algorithms and outcomes (52%); data quality and structure issues (43%); lack of explainability within the model itself and the outcome (36%) which could lead to inaccurate predictions (34%) resulting in poor decisions and reputational damage (11%); inadequate controls or governance (25%); and outsourcing or third-party risks (16%). While 14% of respondents report that ML applications may amplify existing risks and challenges the technology can also introduce novel ones. Half of the survey respondents say the use of ML within their firms could lead to novel risks whereas 23% could not see any novel risks arising and 27% gave no comment. The survey also asked firms to identify what they considered to be novel risks associated with the use of ML. 13% of respondents highlighted the risk related to unethical and biased outcomes which could be particularly harmful for vulnerable consumers. Another area highlighted by 9% of firms was the potential increase in reputational damage by deploying risky ML. In terms of mitigating ML risks respondents said effective governance frameworks (such as MRM and data-quality validation) are key and this should include effective assessment and reviews of ML models from development stages through to deployment. Survey respondents also said clear lines of accountability are key to mitigate risks with some respondents’ highlighting the use of ‘human in the loop’ processes to ensure there is a human accountable for any autonomous decisions. Some respondents suggested consumer protection and prudential regulation could be an effective mitigant to some of the ML risks. Risks to consumers Respondents expect most risks to consumers to decrease over the next three years with the exception of risks related to third-party data ML ethics and model complexity. The top three identified risks are data bias and representativeness bad consumer outcomes and identification of vulnerability. The risks that are expected to decrease the most are ‘weak model implementation’ and ‘skills base and culture’. Chart 14: Most ML risks to consumers expected to decrease over the next three years Risks to firms While the overall level of perceived risks to firms is similar to the risks to consumers there are differences in the ranking and rating of specific risks. The highest three perceived risks to firms are explainability and interpretability data bias and representativeness and model complexity. Survey respondents expect the majority risks to firms to remain constant over the next three years. As with the perceived risks to consumers the same three categories are expected to increase: use of third-party data ML ethics and model complexity. The risks expected to decrease the most are skills base and culture and effective governance structure. These results are largely aligned with the findings of the AIPPF. Chart 15: Highest perceived ML risk to firms in next three years is explainability and interpretability 4.4: Constraints to deployment There are various factors that may constrain deployment of ML systems among respondent firms. The greatest perceived constraint is legacy systems and associated technology infrastructure similar to the 2019 survey. ML applications and the processes around them often need up-to-date hardware database infrastructure and operating systems to run effectively and efficiently. That is why developing deploying and/or integrating ML with legacy systems can become challenging which is the second highest reported challenge. While the third highest reported challenge is that ML is not a priority at this time the fourth biggest challenge is a lack of sufficient skills. As the AIPPF final report notes this lack of skills can become a significant challenge not only at the development and implementation phases of ML models but also in ongoing monitoring and risk management. There may also be insufficient skills in understanding and managing third-party models or data. Chart 16: Legacy systems remain the highest perceived constraint to ML deployment 4.5: Regulation Financial services regulation may act as a barrier to development or a constraint on deployment especially if the perceived compliance burden and associated costs outweigh the perceived benefits. Almost half of firms who responded to the survey said that there are regulations (for which the PRA and/or FCA are the competent authorities) that constrain ML deployment although 30% of respondents said that these are a small constraint with only 5% noting that sectoral regulation is a large constraint (Chart 17). A quarter of respondents said it was due to a lack of clarity with existing regulation and just under a quarter of respondents (22%) thought that existing regulation is itself as a constraint. The Bank PRA and FCA are exploring how the current regulatory framework applies to AI/ML whether additional clarification of the existing regulatory framework may be helpful and how policy can best support further safe and responsible AI/ML adoption via the joint Bank-PRA-FCA Discussion Paper (DP). Chart 17: 47% of respondents said there are regulations that constrain ML deployment

5: Case studies 5.1: Purpose and background The survey asked firms more detailed questions about two case studies: (i) the most advanced ML application in terms of deployment and (ii) the ML application deployed (even on a small scale) within a critical business area. These questions aimed to explore certain case studies in more depth and provide insights into the specific business contexts within which ML models were used. In total 45 firms responded to the first case study (most advanced ML application) and 34 responded to the second question (ML use in critical business area). There was some limited overlap between these use cases. Ten respondents that use ML elsewhere in their firms said they do not use the technology in any critical business areas. The case studies presented here were selected based on the number of responses received so reflect the most commonly reported use cases within the survey sample. Types of ML techniques and data According to firms’ responses for both case studies the ML techniques most often used are on the more complex end of the current spectrum. The most commonly used ML methods are tree-based models regression (excluding simple linear regression) and neural networks (Chart 18). Models in the ‘other’ category included Bayesian approaches alternating least squares grid search techniques and image recognition techniques. Some firms were unsure about the underlying model because it was created and developed by a third-party provider. Chart 18: Tree-based models are the most popular ML techniques Firms often use tree-based ensemble methods such as ‘random forests’ and ‘XGBoost’ which consist of a multitude of – often large – decision trees whose individual predictions are averaged. Respondents said these methods have been relatively successful for prediction in traditional financial data analysis contexts. Neural networks tend to be used to make forecasts based on historical information and find complex relations between non-linear variables. Respondents also used some ML regression techniques such as logistic and penalised regression for forecasting and time series modelling. Most respondents’ ML applications used on average a combination of two methods. In one use case a firm used nine separate ML techniques in a single application. (See Box B for descriptions of different ML methods.) Almost all the use cases where ML was deployed in both advanced and critical areas relied on structured data. Less than 10% of respondents used novel data sources in critical areas (such as unstructured and semi-structured data) but these were more common in some of the advanced deployment case studies. Model validation Model validation is key to ensuring ML models work as intended. These validation techniques might be used in the pre-deployment phase (where the application is being trained and tested) or post-deployment (where the application is live in the market) to continuously assess if the model and ML application is performing within accepted thresholds. Table B: Firms use a variety of validation techniques to assess ML Validation method Description Outcome monitoring against a benchmark Decisions or actions associated with the ML system are monitored using one or multiple metrics. Performance is assessed against a certain benchmark value of those metrics. Outcome monitoring against non-ML model or A–B testing Decisions or actions associated with the ML system are monitored using one or multiple metrics. Performance is assessed by comparing it to the performance of a separate non-ML model. The same approach is used in A–B testing (also known as split testing). ‘Black box’ testing Input-output testing without reference to the internal structure of the ML application. The developer ‘experiments’ with the model feeding it different data inputs to better understand how the model makes its predictions. Explainability tools Tools aimed at explaining the inner workings of the ML model (going beyond input-output testing). Validation of engineered features Engineering features used in the ML application are scrutinised including potential impacts on model performance. Data-quality validation One or more techniques are used to ensure potential issues with data (such as class imbalances missing or erroneous data) are understood and considered in the model development and deployment process. Examples of these include data certification source-to-source verification or data issues tracking. Sources: Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. Chart 19 summarises which ML model validation techniques and frameworks are most frequently used by respondents (as described in Table B). The most common method is outcome-focused monitoring and testing against benchmarks which enables firms to scrutinise how ML models perform against historical benchmarks in terms of profitability customer satisfaction or pricing for example. Data-quality validation including detecting errors biases and risks in the data is the next most frequently used method. Overall these methods were used by 81% of the respondents. In over half of the cases (63%) outcomes were benchmarked against a non-ML model. Black box testing techniques were used in less than half of the cases. Chart 19: Outcome monitoring and testing against benchmarks is the most common ML validation technique Complexity The survey asked firms a range of questions about the complexity of their ML applications. Firms often mentioned that it was difficult to clearly define what model ‘complexity’ means but attempted to make an assessment based on the number of components data sources and algorithms in the ML application. Given this it is clear that there are significant differences in the way firms rate the complexity of ML models and applications. Respondents gave their best estimates of the complexity of the models and related processes. These were then grouped into three categories (‘Low’ ‘Medium’ or ‘High’). For example some firms emphasised the low complexity of the model considering this to be important given that the area for deployment was critical or there was a critical need for the model to be explainable. Others highlighted the large volumes of data processed varying data sources (including third parties) the interaction of different applications and the number of trainable parameters as factors that would result in the application to be considered medium or high complexity. Chart 20: Respondents rated more than a third of ML use cases as ‘High’ complexity The majority of respondents design and develop ML applications in-house. However they sometimes rely on third-party providers for the underlying platforms and infrastructure such as cloud computing (see above in Section 2.4). In one case where ML models were provided by a third party the firm stated that it was difficult to classify the complexity of the models as they did not know the types of underlying models nor did they have oversight of the development of the ML applications. As summarised in Chart 20 two thirds of ML applications are considered to be of medium to high complexity. Safeguards Firms use a range of mechanisms and controls to manage the risks associated with ML applications. This includes the novel challenges related to ML such as the additional complexity of ML techniques issues with explainability and the continuous lifecycle of some ML applications. 42% of respondents said that they use some form of monitoring but did not specify the safeguards in place for the applications. The most common controls among respondents are ‘alert systems’ ‘human-in-the-loop’ and ‘back-up systems’. ‘Alert systems’ flag unusual or unexpected actions to employees ‘human-in-the-loop’ are systems where decisions made by the ML application are only executed after review or approval from a human and ‘back-up systems’ (sometimes also known as ‘shadow models’) perform the same or similar function as the ML application and can be used instead of it if needed. 5.2: Cross-firm themes Most advanced use cases Overall the most common areas where ML use is most advanced were (Chart 21) credit underwriting and insurance pricing/underwriting. Among insurers the most advanced deployment of ML is typically within their core business to support either pricing or underwriting. Other sectors showed greater variation in the most advanced use case. Other examples of ML models in the most advanced stage of deployment were: expected loss accounting models; claims handing; monitoring for insider trading or market manipulation; to direct queries within customer interfaces; ‘know your customer’ (KYC) checks; trading strategy and execution; payments authorisation; and staff wellness programmes. Chart 21: Areas where respondents reported their most advanced ML applications Most critical use cases The uses of ML within critical areas varied considerably including within similar types of firm (Chart 22). Those most commonly cited were as an input to compliance AML and KYC. The critical use cases for credit underwriting were similar to the advanced ones with ML used to support lending decisions sometimes as part of scorecards and sometimes as a direct input to automated underwriting (in retail credit). Within risk management respondents described how ML was used within models predicting expected cash flows redemptions delinquencies inappropriate account use (eg a personal account being used for business purposes) or excess losses. Other activities in critical areas making use of ML were: insurance underwriting (particularly within life insurance); claims handling; monitoring for insider trading or market manipulation; informing trading strategies; directing queries within customer interfaces; managing fund transfers; IT security; and managing a network of third-party experts. Relative to the most advanced cases of ML deployment respondents were much less likely to cite marketing or cross-selling with only one respondent describing the use of ML in this area as critical (the specific example being in the optimisation of mortgage rates to retain customers). Chart 22: Areas where respondents reported their critical ML applications 5.3: Prominent use cases Insurance pricing and underwriting Respondents gave examples of how ML applications are used in motor risk pricing and life insurance underwriting as well as in making use of novel data sets to improve pricing or risk management around other products. For example one insurer uses an ML-based application to pre-approve consumers for life insurance using data already available from bank accounts and credit rating. In motor insurance firms use ML models to predict the frequency and severity of expected claims for all new business and renewal quotes. Some motor technical risk models are being migrated from traditional generalised linear models to ML models which use techniques like gradient boosting. These models seek to predict the cost of a written policy and can be used in subsequent processes ranging from performance monitoring to pricing. Some respondents use telematics risk modelling based on Deep Neural Networks to estimate driver behaviour and thereby predict the magnitude of the claim and determine the premiums charged to the consumer. In other firms the assessment of motor claim liability to provide a recommendation to the claim handler is based on ML models. This involves automated early liability decisioning and can improve subsequent claim journeys and outcomes for the consumer. Credit underwriting ML use cases around credit underwriting typically supplemented existing credit scorecards either when a customer applied for a loan or as part of a pre-approval process. ML applications are used to process unstructured data or large data volumes significantly reducing the need for manual processing. However one firm described their most advanced use of ML as determining the key input in deciding whether or not to extend credit. In this case the ML algorithm and model uses features at the point of new credit card applications to predict likelihood of customer delinquency within the first year of the loan. ML-based credit decisioning in relation to personal loans was not widespread among the respondents but starting to be introduced by some firms including for products like loan underwriting in auto finance. One model in the early stages of operation predicts the probability of the applicant entering significant arrears in the first 12 months of the loan being opened. Real-time authorisations are also increasingly specific to the personal account of the consumer drawing on historical authorisation data. Marketing ML applications can be used for various aspects of marketing and customer engagement. Instead of presenting the same default combination of products and services to all potential customers ML applications use the inputs provided by the potential customer as part of the online quote journey to predict a bundle of tailored product or service options. This can then be further manually adapted to the consumers’ needs. Other ML applications can be used to prevent customers’ policies from lapsing. Some firms use product recommendation ML applications to identify new product sales opportunities. One respondent noted that this is the most advanced ML application owing to its consumption of broad financial behaviour features from global data assets. Fraud prevention and anti-money laundering As this survey and the 2019 survey found ML is a becoming a common technique for fraud detection and AML in payments transactions especially for card authorisations that flow through the payments network. As transactions are processed the ML application assigns a risk score allowing card issuers to stop potential fraud losses before the transaction goes through. Similarly automated fraud screening of customer transactions on the retail non-plastics channels (internet banking telephony branch and Open Banking) is taking place. As fraudulent transaction risks faced by investments funds are growing ML-based transaction monitoring and detection capabilities are developed. This often involves a combination of ML and rule-based engine monitor activity and highlights anomalies in bond claims and online portal journeys.

Box B: ML methods Advanced regression includes penalised regression techniques such as ridge regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Penalised regression involves the application of regularisation techniques to a standard regression models (such as logistic regression). This penalises the regression weights leading to models that use less input variables or generalise better to new data. These models tend to be less complex and more interpretable. Tree-based models use decision trees which produce an output using a cascade of binary (yes/no) decisions they are capable of handling both regression and classification tasks. The most common algorithms in this class are typically ensemble methods in which an output is determined by a collection of decision trees that vote on or average their individual outputs. Neural networks are loosely based on neuronal structures in the brain and consist of layers of nodes each having weighted connections to nodes in other layers. The neural network learns by adjusting these weights in response to training data. Neural networks can be used for both regression and classification and have wide-ranging applications including computer vision and natural language processing. Natural language processing (NLP) itself involves the application of algorithms – often neural networks – to identify and extract natural language rules such that unstructured language data are converted into a form that computers can understand. Dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of variables under consideration by constructing combinations of those variables to form a smaller set of principle variables. Approaches can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.

6: Conclusion based on survey findings Overall the adoption of ML in UK financial services has increased since 2019 and is more mature and widespread today. 72% of the firms that responded to this (2022) survey reported using or developing ML applications. This trend looks set to continue and survey respondents expect the overall median number of ML applications to increase by over 3.5 times over the next three years. That is why the Bank and FCA will continue to monitor ML developments and conduct similar surveys going forward. Firms now use the technology across a greater range and variety of business areas. While AML and fraud detection applications are widespread ML is also used: in banks for enhanced credit risk analytics; by other lenders to automate loan underwriting; in insurers to analyse driving behaviour and claims risk; and among investment and capital markets firms to extract unstructured alternative investment data from multiple sources. Moreover the ML applications that are used in these business areas are more advanced and increasingly embedded in day-to-day operations. 79% of ML applications among are respondents are deployed across a considerable share of business areas and/or are critical to the business area. In contrast in 2019 44% of applications were still in the pre-deployment phase (ie proof-of-concepts) and only 32% were deployed across a considerable share or all of a business area. The increase in ML adoption is mirrored by an increase in the number of firms that are taking a strategic approach to the technology. The majority of respondents in the 2022 survey (79%) had some form of strategy for the development deployment monitoring and use of ML. Similarly many respondents have developed governance frameworks to manage their use of ML and 80% of respondents to this (2022) survey say this fits into their data governance framework. This is promising as the Bank and the FCA consider good governance essential for the safe and responsible adoption of ML in financial services. Safe adoption of ML also means that consumers firms and the wider financial system can benefit from the technology. Currently the greatest identified benefits are from enhanced data and analytics capabilities increased operational efficiency and improved combatting of fraud and money laundering. While small overall all benefits are expected to increase over the next three years as the technology becomes even more widely used which may improve the personalisation of financial products and services as well as overall customer engagement. However there are trade-offs with the use of ML and the technology can pose risks. Respondents consider the current levels of risk to consumers and firms as low to medium. The top risks to consumers related to data bias and representativeness while the top risks to firms are the lack of explainability and interpretability of ML applications. Firms are also contending the practical constraints to ML adoption and deployment. The greatest constraints are associated with legacy systems and the associated technology infrastructure at firms which was the case in 2019. These are followed closely by the lack of sufficient skills. For the Bank and FCA it is helpful to understand that almost half of the firms who responded to the survey said there are regulations (for which the PRA and/or FCA are the competent authorities) that constrain ML deployment with 11% of those saying that these are a large constraint. Of those who thought that regulation was a constraint over half said it is a lack of clarity with existing regulation. The Bank PRA and FCA have published a Discussion Paper (DP) on how the current UK regulatory framework applies to AI/ML. The DP also explores how policy can best support further safe and responsible AI/ML adoption and whether additional clarification of the existing regulatory framework may be helpful. Readers of this survey are encouraged to engage with the DP and submit a response.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWYvYW5hbHlzaXMvYmhhcmF0LTIyLWV0Zi1tYWtlcy1hLWNvbWUtYmFjay10b3BzLXRoZS1yZXR1cm4tY2hhcnRzLWluLW9uZS15ZWFyL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0Nzc3Mjg3LmNtc9IBhwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWYvYW5hbHlzaXMvYmhhcmF0LTIyLWV0Zi1tYWtlcy1hLWNvbWUtYmFjay10b3BzLXRoZS1yZXR1cm4tY2hhcnRzLWluLW9uZS15ZWFyL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDc3NzI4Ny5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bharat 22 ETF makes a come back; tops the return charts in one year,"ET Online

ET Online

After being the worst performer among the equity mutual fund categories in 2020 Bharat 22 ETF is topping the return charts in one year with 14.46% returns . The scheme has performed better than all the large cap funds in the industry. This is the fund’s best performance till date since it was launched in 2017. The major reason for this turn around is supposed to be the recovery in PSU stocks Bharat 22 ETF is an open-ended exchange traded fund investing in 22 companies including three private sector stocks and 19 public sector units (PSUs) listed in the S&P BSE Bharat 22 Index. The scheme was launched by the Government of India to fulfill its disinvestment target in PSUs. The scheme has underperformed its benchmark continuously from 2017- 2020 before finally picking up in the last one year.Source: ETMutualFunds (Blue bar- fund; red bar-benchmark)The scheme has offered -4.79% returns in 2018 -3.81% in 2019 -7.98% in 2020 and 40% returns in 2021. On a trailing return basis the scheme is now the topper in the one year period and has considerably recovered the three year performance. Here’s a look at the trailing returns:Source: ETMutualFundsAccording to the fund manager and financial advisors the Bharat 22 ETF managed by ICICI Prudential MF invests across six sectors including Industrials Finance Utilities Energy FMCG and Basic Materials. Most of these PSU names were available at cheap valuations before 2021.“Most of the PSU stocks in Bharat 22 ETF were geared towards the domestic recovery cycle which played out over the past year as a result of which the portfolio constituents gained significantly. The Indian equity market witnessed a very narrow rally between 2018 to 2020. Post the pandemic as the economy opened up and the market rallied the underlying constituents of Bharat 22 did very well. Most of the names in the portfolio are significant players in their respective sector and are some of the best companies with high future growth potential” says Chintan Haria Head Product & Strategy ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.Financial planners believe that PSU stocks that make a huge part of Bharat 22 ETF might see a good time in the near to medium term with some volatility. Hence the scheme can continue to do well. However they point out that the scheme is too PSU heavy for a diversified retail portfolio and hence should be looked at as a tactical bet.“PSU stocks have been underperforming majorly not in the last 2-3 years but 10 years before that as well. That is majorly because PSU companies had major governance issues. Now that some of those issues are resolved the stocks are doing well. We have to understand that the issues are not totally off the table and the lull period in such funds can be long. PSU funds had given negative returns for years before this recovery happened. Hence I believe that those who want to take a 1-2 year tactical bet on PSU stocks can look at this fund but for retail long-term investors I would suggest a diversified equity fund” says P Chokkalingam Director Prakala Wealth a financial planning firm based in Chennai."

Zee Hussain has been appointed president of the AT&T Public Sector business to succeed Jason Porter who will move to a new role within the company. Porter previously led AT&T's FirstNet public safety network business for three years and expanded his role to all of public sector in early 2021.

Hussain most recently led AT&T’s enterprise sales teams focused on commercial customers across the health care manufacturing and transportation industries.

FirstNet will now reside within the public sector unit and get a new president in nearly two-decade company veteran Jim Bugel who will report to Hussain. Bugel was part of the leadership team responsible for securing the multibillion-dollar contract to build and operate that public safety network in 2017.

Those appointments and the others described in this article take effect Sunday according to a company announcement.

Calendar year 2021 for AT&T was one that saw the corporation undertake a broad strategic reset back to focusing on technology and connectivity.

AT&T's exit from the pay television and media markets put that pivot back to the core lineage as did the sale of the defense IT professional services business to Tyto Athene also in 2021.

When I spoke with Porter and AT&T's defense leader Jill Singer for our 2021 Top 100 series and Project 38 podcast they told me public sector would take greater precedence in the larger company given the refocus on technology and telecommunications.

“It’s a doubling down a reinvesting in public sector and FirstNet because of our ability to differentiate and our ability to grow new logos the affinity we have across this space opening doors into accounts that we hadn’t been in in a long time"" Porter said then.

Board members at privately held and family-owned companies play an important role in governance and oversight and should be appropriately compensated for their contributions and efforts. However the appropriate amount of compensation has been difficult to determine due to the lack of available market data on private company board pay.

To address this data deficiency Compensation Advisory Partners (CAP) and Family Business and Private Company Director magazines conducts our Private Company Board Compensation and Governance Survey. The new 2022 third edition of the survey contains over 1200 responses an increase of about 300 participants from the prior full version of the survey in 2020. The high number of survey participants illustrates the enthusiasm and need for this data.

About the Survey Participants

The over 1200 respondents represent companies in a broad range of industries and revenue sizes. Manufacturing is the most prevalent industry in the survey (25% of respondents) followed by professional scientific and technical services (11%); finance and insurance (9%); retail trade (7%) construction (6%) real estate rental and leasing (6%); and wholesale trade (6%).

Participating companies span a variety of sizes as measured by revenue number of employees and assets (financial services and insurance companies only). Exhibit 1 shows the distribution of responses across revenue ranges.

Of the participating companies 70 percent are wholly family-owned or majority family-owned or controlled. The survey also drew participation from companies that are closely held private equity-owned and owned by employees through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). The business structures represented include S corporations C corporations limited liability companies (LLCs) partnerships and other structures. Most participants are based in the United States but the survey drew responses from all over the world. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents have fiduciary boards while the remainder have advisory boards.

Compensation Components

The survey found that 86 percent of participants provide some form of compensation to board members. In contrast to public companies 44 percent of private companies compensate “inside” directors (defined as family members or shareholders who serve on the board). For these companies that compensate inside directors 67 percent compensate them on the same basis as the outside directors. The survey results reflect the differences from public company board pay. Private companies are more likely to compensate a larger group of directors and are more likely to use meeting fees in addition to annual retainers. Only a minority of private companies use long-term incentives such as phantom and real equity in their director pay programs.

Annual Retainer

Annual cash retainers are part of a typical director’s compensation package. Of the private companies surveyed 45 percent compensate directors through cash retainers only while another 27 percent use both retainers and meeting fees. The median amount of the cash retainer is $30000 for 2022 an increase from $28000 in 2020. Board retainers are highly correlated with company size as shown in Exhibit 3.

Long-Term Incentives

Not surprisingly the survey found that the prevalence of long-term incentives for private company board service is low since private companies do not have stock that is easily liquid.

Only 26 percent of private companies offer long-term incentives for directors with real equity – stock options or restricted stock/units – being the favored vehicles. Typical practices for private company long-term incentive awards are to grant the awards either annually or when the director is appointed to the board and to have the awards subject to vesting either immediately or over three years. The use of long-term incentives indicates that private companies continue to compete for board talent and are working to retain and align board members with the company’s overall success. CAP expects the use of long-term incentives for director compensation to increase over time especially at larger private companies.

Meeting Fees and Other Components

Other key survey findings are:

The most common elements of cash compensation for private company directors are annual retainers (71%) travel reimbursements (53%) and in-person meeting fees (49%).

Meeting fees continue to be used by private companies while most publicly traded companies have migrated to retainers only. Of the private companies surveyed 13 percent use meeting fees as their only form of cash compensation which is down significantly from the 2020 survey.

As with retainers meeting fees increase with company size. (See Exhibit 4.) The median in-person meeting fee is $2500 which is unchanged from 2020.

The use of telephonic/virtual meeting fees is reported by 25 percent of companies in 2022 which reflects a normalized level as more companies have returned to in-person meetings. The median telephonic/virtual meeting fee is $1000 which is unchanged from 2020.

Some private companies provide additional compensation for board leadership roles. When the incremental leadership retainers are considered as a multiple of regular board member retainers the median multiple is two-thirds for the incremental board chair retainer and slightly less than half for the incremental lead director retainer.

The typical incremental retainer for a committee chair is $6000 at median but is only provided by a minority of companies.

Governance Findings

In addition to benchmarking compensation levels and practices the survey covers many governance issues including board size independence workload term limits and diversity equity & inclusion

The typical private company board size ranges from five to eight directors with a median of six directors. This reflects a decrease in board size from the 2020 survey. The 2022 board size indicates a return to more normal levels seen in our 2019 survey. The 2022 board composition is approximately half inside directors and half independent/outside directors with a slight tendency toward having a greater proportion of inside directors.

Other governance findings are limited to survey participants.

Diversity Equity & Inclusion

Private companies still have some work to do in the area of diversity equity and inclusion. The survey asked respondents about the importance of board diversity and the number of women and minority directors on the board. The 2022 survey saw an uptick in private companies indicating that diversity is “very important” or “extremely important” a trend that was first recognized in the 2020 survey and is expected to continue in the future given the current emphasis on diversity equity and inclusion (DE&I) issues across general industry. Of the survey respondents 72 percent report having one or more women on the board up from 70 percent in 2020 while only 26 percent report having one or more minority members on the board up from 24 percent in 2020. Private companies looking to diversify their boards coupled with the competition for board talent could result in an increase in compensation levels to compete with public company boards which are facing mounting public and investor pressure to increase the diversity and representation of their boards.

Exhibit 5 shows the reported importance of board diversity compared to the previous iterations of this survey.

Total Director Compensation Cost

Three new questions were asked in the 2022 survey to better understand the total cost of governance for a private company. The survey asked participants to provide average annual total compensation data for ONE director and for ALL directors on the board. Additionally participants were asked to estimate annual total board compensation expense as a percent of revenue which is a statistic that can be used for comparison across companies. Exhibit 6 shows the median for total compensation cost for ONE director and for ALL directors for the total survey sample.

Total compensation includes annual board cash retainer board meeting fees any committee service retainers or meeting fees any long-term incentives and all other compensation (such as travel and expense reimbursement).

The total cost of governance is correlated with company size. This relationship is driven by differences in the amount of compensation given to individual directors as well as differences in the size of the board. As a company’s revenue increases the complexity of operations regulatory requirements and the responsibilities of the board also increase. To deal with this greater responsibility larger companies may have a larger board and separate committees. Higher compensation is needed to attract qualified talent and reward them for a more significant time commitment.

Looking Ahead

Now that the full Private Company Board Compensation and Governance Survey is in its third iteration trends can be evaluated. The 2022 results were consistent with 2019 and 2020 which is not surprising as board pay is not typically evaluated on an annual basis so changes emerge slowly. Median annual cash retainers increased across most revenue sizes the typical board size decreased to pre-COVID levels and respondents indicated heightened interest in board diversity although it is still a work in progress. The main issues are finding the right skill-set and cultural fit of board member candidates.

Trends that CAP expects to see in the coming years for private company board compensation and governance include:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmFjY2VudHVyZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2FjY2VudHVyZS1hbmQtZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3VkLWV4cGFuZC1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLXZhbHVlLWZyb20tdGVjaG5vbG9neS1kYXRhLWFuZC1hadIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accenture and Google Cloud Expand Partnership to Accelerate Value from Technology Data and AI,"Today more than 13000 skilled Accenture cloud professionals with over 5000 Google Cloud certifications are helping companies shape move and operate their business on Google Cloud.

On October 5 2022 the Treasury Department requested comments on the new provisions. The Treasury said it seeks input by November 4 2022 but that it will consider comments received after that date if the consideration will not delay issuance of guidance.

The new incentives for public power will be in the form of cash payments from the Internal Revenue Service. The payments are called ""refundable tax credits"" because they are based on tax credits for taxable entities that are payable in cash. The payments have similarities to direct-pay subsidies for Build America Bonds and New Clean Renewable Energy Bonds but there are significant differences.

The incentives include a production tax credit (PTC) and an investment tax credit (ITC) for generating renewable energy or installing batteries and other energy storage facilities as well as credits for carbon oxide sequestration production of clean hydrogen and production of energy from existing nuclear facilities. Direct-pay subsidies generally will be available only for facilities placed in service after 2022.

A public power agency will need to own a facility in order to receive subsidies for it.

For each of the credits there is a base rate that is increased to a full rate if the facility meets certain wage and/or apprenticeship requirements. Additional bonus rates are available for PTC and ITC facilities that are located in certain areas or meet domestic content requirements.

For facilities financed with tax-exempt debt the credits are reduced by 15% or if less the percentage of the facility financed with tax-exempt proceeds. This reduction does not apply to the existing nuclear facility credit.

PTC and ITC facilities that start construction after 2023 generally must meet or be excepted from domestic content requirements to qualify for certain direct payments.

Overview of credits

PTC – In general

The PTC is a per-MWh credit for producing energy from a qualifying resource. For 2022 the base rate is $5.20 per MWh and the full rate which applies if wage and apprenticeship requirements are met is $26 per MWh. Subject to possible clarification from Congress or the Treasury these rates may be increased for 2022 to $5.50 and $27.50 respectively based on a rounding convention in the IRA. The rates are adjusted annually for inflation.

The PTC is paid over the 10-year period beginning on the date the facility is placed in service.

There are two types of PTC. One is limited to specified renewable generation facilities. The other is technology-neutral.

Renewable generation PTC

The renewable generation PTC applies to certain facilities that start construction before 2025. It is calculated based on the amount of electricity produced and sold to unrelated persons.

It is available for facilities that produce electricity using one of the following resources: wind solar geothermal incremental hydropower marine and hydrokinetic biomass or municipal solid waste (from landfill gas or otherwise). Detailed rules apply to determine whether a facility using one of these resources is eligible for the PTC.

The renewable generation PTC is reduced by one-half for facilities using municipal solid waste or biomass. This reduction does not apply however to ""closed-loop"" biomass facilities that use plants grown exclusively to produce electricity.

A generation facility using renewable natural gas is not eligible for the PTC if the RNG was produced at a facility claiming the ITC.

If a public power agency owns both a PTC-eligible generation facility and a qualified clean hydrogen production facility described below and uses electricity generated by the generation facility to produce qualified clean hydrogen the agency is eligible to claim production credits for both the electricity and the hydrogen production if the production and use of each are verified by an unrelated party and other requirements are met. This treatment is an exception to the requirement that electricity from renewable generation PTC facilities must be sold to unrelated persons.

Technology-neutral PTC

The second PTC is technology-neutral. It applies to generation facilities with a greenhouse gas emissions rate of zero or less that are placed in service after 2024.

Facilities eligible for the tech-neutral PTC include not only renewable resources but also for example nuclear facilities and natural-gas fired plants that meet carbon capture and storage or utilization requirements.

The tech-neutral PTC is calculated based on the amount of electricity produced and sold to unrelated persons and if the facility has a metering device owned and operated by an unrelated person sold consumed or stored by the facility owner.

For a combined heat and power facility both electricity and thermal energy produced are taken into account in computing the tech-neutral PTC and greenhouse gas emissions. Thermal energy is converted to a megawatt-hour equivalent based on the facility's heat rate.

For each year beginning in 2025 the Treasury is directed to publish a table identifying greenhouse gas emissions rates for types and categories of facilities.

The tech-neutral PTC will start to phase out after 2032 or if later the year total US greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall by at least 75% from the 2022 amount. The PTC will be reduced to 75% of its value for facilities starting construction in the second year after the phase-out is triggered. It will be reduced to 50% for facilities starting construction in the third year after the phase-out trigger and 0% for facilities starting construction in any subsequent year.

ITC – In general

The ITC is a one-time payment after the facility is placed in service. It is calculated based on a percentage of the cost of qualifying energy property. For most ITC projects the base rate is 6% and the full rate is 30%.

There are two types of ITC. One is limited to certain types of energy property. The other is technology-neutral.

Energy-property ITC

Property eligible for the first ITC includes a variety of generation facilities including solar wind geothermal fuel cell microturbine and combined heat and power system property. It also includes energy storage technology renewable natural gas production facilities microgrid controllers waste energy recovery property that generates electricity from building or equipment heat electrochromic glass and geothermal heat pumps.

The owner of a PTC-eligible facility can elect to claim the ITC instead of the PTC.

The ITC is available for certain hydrogen production facilities in lieu of the hydrogen production credit described below. The ITC amount for these facilities varies depending on the expected lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate through the point of production.

The ITC is also available for network upgrades and gen-tie lines needed to connect generation assets to the grid. It applies only with respect to generation facilities that have a maximum net output of five megawatts (AC) or less and for which the ITC is claimed. The interconnection property is required to be installed pursuant to an ""interconnection agreement"" with a utility and must be owned by the utility.

If a municipal utility owns the generation facility and the interconnection property there will not be an interconnection agreement. From a policy standpoint it appears that a municipal utility should be eligible for an ITC for the interconnection property in these circumstances. However confirmation from the Treasury may be needed on this point.

For most facilities claiming the energy-property ITC construction must begin before 2025. It must start before 2033 for hydrogen production projects and before 2035 for geothermal heat pumps. The ITC starts to phase down for geothermal heat pumps starting construction after 2032.

Detailed rules apply to determine whether facilities are ITC-eligible.

Technology-neutral ITC

The second ITC is technology-neutral. It applies to generation facilities with anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rates of not greater than zero and to energy storage facilities in each case that are placed in service after 2024.

As with the tech-neutral PTC generation facilities eligible for the tech-neutral ITC include not only renewable resources but also for example nuclear facilities and facilities producing electricity through combustion or gasification but with a net greenhouse gas emissions rate of zero or less.

For each year beginning in 2025 the Treasury is directed to publish a table identifying greenhouse gas emissions rates for types and categories of facilities.

Interconnection property for generation facilities with a maximum net output of five megawatts (AC) or less is eligible for the tech-neutral ITC in the same manner as described above for the energy-property ITC.

The tech-neutral ITC will phase down on the same schedule that applies to the tech-neutral PTC as described above.

Carbon capture

The carbon capture credit is available for certain electricity generation facilities that capture CO2 and other carbon oxide using carbon capture equipment placed in service after 2022. The credit is paid over the 12-year period beginning on the date the carbon capture equipment is placed in service.

The full credit equals $85 per metric ton of carbon oxide captured and stored permanently underground and $60 per metric ton of carbon oxide captured and used for enhanced oil or natural gas recovery or used to make a commercial product. These amounts will be adjusted for inflation each year after 2026.

To be eligible for the credit a generation facility must capture at least 18750 metric tons of carbon oxide during the year and the capture equipment must have a design capacity of at least 75 percent of the baseline carbon oxide emissions for the turbine with which it is paired.

Clean hydrogen

The clean hydrogen production credit is available for facilities that start construction before 2033 and produce hydrogen through a process that results in a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate through the point of production of not greater than four kilograms of CO2e per kilogram of hydrogen. It is paid over the 10-year period beginning on the date the facility is placed in service.

If wage and apprenticeship requirements are met the credit equals the applicable percentage of $3 multiplied by the kilograms of qualified clean hydrogen produced and sold or used by the facility owner during the year and verified by an unrelated party. The applicable percentage ranges from 20 to 100 percent depending on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate of the production process. The $3 is available only where the lifecycle emissions to produce the hydrogen are less than 0.45 kilograms per kilogram of hydrogen. The $3 amount will be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2024.

The IRA states that direct-pay subsidies are available for qualified clean hydrogen production facilities placed in service after 2012. Clarification from Congress or the Treasury may be needed to confirm whether 2012 (and not 2022) was the intended date.

Existing nuclear

Certain nuclear facilities are eligible for a production credit if they were put in service before the enactment of the IRA and are not ""advanced"" facilities described in section 45J of the tax code. The credit is available over a nine-year period for electricity produced and sold after 2023.

If prevailing wage requirements are met for any alteration or repair of the facility the credit is $15 multiplied by the megawatt hours of electricity produced and sold during the year to unrelated persons.

The credit is reduced by 16 percent of the excess of (1) gross receipts from electricity sales over (2) the product of $25 and the megawatt hours of such sales. Gross receipts are increased to include certain amounts received by the facility owner under a federal state or local government zero-emission credit program.

The $15 and $25 amounts will be adjusted for inflation after 2024.

Treasury guidance will be needed on the calculation of gross receipts including the determination of gross receipts for a public power agency that is a member of a regional transmission organization and also supplies wholesale electricity to other municipal utilities.

If a public power agency owns both an existing nuclear facility and a qualified clean hydrogen production facility and uses electricity generated by the nuclear facility to produce qualified clean hydrogen it appears the agency should be eligible to claim production credits for both the electricity and the hydrogen production if the production and use of each are verified by an unrelated party and other requirements are met. Treasury guidance will be needed to clarify how a facility owner may be eligible for both credits in these circumstances including how receipts from deemed electricity sales would be determined.

Wage and apprenticeship

For each of the credits described herein the base rate is increased by a multiple of five if the facility satisfies wage and apprenticeship requirements (except that for existing nuclear only wage and not apprenticeship requirements apply).

A facility is deemed to meet the wage and apprenticeship requirements if its construction starts no later than 59 days after the US Treasury publishes guidance on those requirements (except that facilities claiming the hydrogen production credit must satisfy the wage requirements for alterations or repairs to receive the full credit regardless of when construction begins).

Projects claiming the ITC or PTC are deemed to satisfy the wage and apprenticeship provisions if they have a maximum net output of less than one megawatt (AC) of electrical energy (or for certain ITC projects less than one megawatt of thermal energy).

To meet the wage requirements the facility owner must ensure that any laborers and mechanics employed by it or any contractor or subcontractor in the construction of the facility and in its alteration or repair during the applicable credit period are paid wages not less than Davis-Bacon prevailing rates.

For the PTC and hydrogen production credit the credit period is the first ten years of facility operation. For carbon oxide sequestration it is the 12-year period beginning on the date the carbon capture equipment is placed in service. For the ITC it is the first five years of facility operation.

For existing nuclear the wage requirements apply only to alterations or repairs (and not original construction which will have occurred in the past) and appear to apply throughout the nine-year credit period subject to possible clarification from the Treasury.

To meet the apprenticeship requirements the facility owner must ensure that qualified apprentices perform a minimum percentage of the total labor hours of the construction alteration or repair work. The minimum percentage is 10% if construction starts before 2023 12.5% if it starts in 2023 and 15% if it starts after 2023.

The apprenticeship requirements will be deemed met if the facility owner and its contractors and subcontractors make a good faith effort to comply but are unable to find apprentices from a registered apprenticeship program.

Additional rules apply to the wage and apprenticeship requirements and there are cure provisions if the IRS asserts later on audit that some workers were paid too little or total labor hours worked by apprentices fell short of what was required.

Domestic content

Bonus credit

A bonus credit applies to PTC and ITC facilities that meet domestic content requirements. For the PTC the bonus is 10% of the otherwise-applicable direct payment (excluding any energy community bonus described below). For the ITC it is an additional ten percentage points if the facility meets wage and apprenticeship requirements and an extra two percentage points if it does not.

A facility meets the domestic content requirements if all the steel and iron and a specified portion of manufactured products that are components of the facility are produced in the United States.

For facilities (other than offshore wind) that begin construction before 2025 manufactured components are considered produced in the United States if at least 40% of their total cost is attributable to mining production or manufacturing in the United States. The percentage is increased to 45% if construction starts in 2025 50% if it starts in 2026 and 55% if it starts after 2026.

For offshore wind the percentages are 20% if construction starts before 2025 27.5% if it starts in 2025 35% if it starts in 2026 45% if it starts in 2027 and 55% if it starts after 2027.

For the tech-neutral ITC clarification from Congress or the Treasury may be needed as to whether the 40% (20% for offshore wind) threshold is increased for construction starting after 2024.

Additional Treasury guidance will be necessary to clarify the domestic content bonus requirements.

Requirements if construction starts after 2023

PTC and ITC projects that start construction after 2023 must meet domestic content requirements or be excepted from them to qualify for certain direct payments.

For projects starting construction in 2024 or 2025 the otherwise-available direct payments are reduced to 90% or 85% of their value respectively unless the project meets or is excepted from domestic content requirements. For projects that begin construction after 2025 direct payments are not available unless domestic content requirements are met or an exception applies.

These reductions do not apply to PTC and ITC projects with a maximum net output of less than one megawatt (AC).

The IRA directs the Treasury to provide exceptions for projects if the inclusion of US-made steel iron or manufactured products would increase overall construction costs by more than 25% or the relevant steel iron or manufactured products are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory quality.

Energy communities

A bonus credit applies to any PTC or ITC project located in an energy community. For the PTC the bonus is 10% of the otherwise-applicable direct payment (excluding any domestic content bonus). For the ITC it is an additional ten percentage points if the facility meets wage and apprenticeship requirements and an extra two percentage points if it does not.

There are three types of energy communities.

The first is a brownfield site as defined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980.

The second is a metropolitan or non-metropolitan statistical area with an unemployment rate at or above the national average that has or at any time after 2009 had at least 0.17% direct employment or 25% local tax revenues related to the extraction processing transport or storage of coal oil or natural gas.

The third is a census tract in which a coal mine closed after 1999 or a coal-fired electric generating unit was retired after 2009 or any census tract that directly adjoins such a tract.

Treasury guidance will be needed to clarify the areas that qualify as energy communities.

Environmental justice allocation

Certain ITC projects are eligible for a 10- or even 20-percent bonus if the facility owner applies for and receives an ""environmental justice"" allocation from the IRS. A project with such an allocation could receive a total ITC of as high as 70% assuming compliance with wage and apprenticeship domestic content and energy community requirements and eligibility for the 20% environmental justice bonus.

Eligible projects are wind and solar (and certain related storage) facilities with a maximum net output of less than five megawatts (AC) that either are located in a low-income community or on Indian land or are part of a qualified low-income residential building project or a qualified low-income economic benefit project.

Projects in a low-income community or on Indian land are eligible for a 10% bonus. Facilities that are part of a qualified low-income residential building project can receive a 20% bonus if the financial benefits of the electricity produced by the facility are allocated equitably among residents. Qualified low-income economic benefit projects can receive a 20% bonus if low-income households receive at least one-half of the financial benefits.

A nationwide allocation of 1800 megawatts (DC) will be available for each year from 2023 through at least 2032.

Beginning in 2025 eligible facilities will be expanded to include not only solar and wind but also other zero-emission generation projects that do not use fuel combustion or gasification.

Direct-pay procedures

Treasury guidance will be needed on the procedures and timing for requesting direct payments. The IRA provides that the right of a state or local government to receive a direct-pay subsidy for a year accrues on the date the entity would be required to file a Form 990 tax return for that year if it were a 501(c)(3) organization (or if later the date it submits a claim for the subsidy). Thus subject to Treasury guidance it appears that a state or local government with a calendar year accounting period will file for year 1 subsidies by May 15 of year 2.

If a facility owner requests and receives a subsidy in excess of the permitted amount the IRS is authorized to receive a return of the excessive payment plus a penalty equal to 20% of that excessive payment. The 20% penalty would not apply however if the facility owner demonstrates to the IRS that it had reasonable cause for requesting the excessive payment.

Sequestration

The IRA contains a ""gross-up"" provision to prevent direct-pay subsidies from being reduced under budget sequestration rules. Under pre-IRA law certain federal spending such as subsidies for Build America Bonds is subject to across-the-board cuts. The current sequester rate of 5.7% is scheduled to continue through the end of the federal government's 2030 fiscal year.

Under the IRA gross-up the new direct-pay subsidies are automatically increased by 6.0445%. Thus a $1000000 subsidy is increased to $1060445. If this grossed-up amount is reduced by 5.7% the resulting subsidy equals the original $1000000.

Thus the current sequester does not adversely impact the newly-authorized direct payments. On the other hand the IRA does not preclude the possibility of a future change in the gross-up percentage or sequestration rate.

The gross-up does not apply to BABs or other previously-authorized direct-pay bonds.

Tax-exempt vs. taxable financing

One consideration for public power agencies will be whether tax-exempt or taxable financing is most advantageous for a project receiving a direct-pay subsidy. If a facility is financed with tax-exempt debt the subsidy is reduced by 15% or if less the percentage of the facility financed with tax-exempt proceeds.

For facilities claiming the direct-pay ITC absent favorable Treasury guidance overissuance rules generally will limit an issuer's ability to use long-term tax-exempt financing for the costs that are expected as of the date of bond issuance to be covered by the ITC.

For example if an issuer finances 15% or more of the cost of a project with tax-exempt debt and otherwise would be eligible for a 30% ITC the ITC will be reduced by 15% to 25.5%. The issuer will thus expect to receive a payment from the IRS for 25.5% of the project costs within a year or so after the project is placed in service.

Absent unique circumstances (for example if the bonds were issued before the enactment of the IRA) overissuance rules generally would limit the term of any tax-exempt debt for the 25.5% portion based on the expected date of receipt of the subsidy from the IRS. Accordingly any tax-exempt debt issued for the 25.5% portion generally would need to have a maturity or optional redemption date corresponding to the expected subsidy receipt date. The remaining 74.5% of the costs would be eligible for long-term tax-exempt financing under established tax rules.

PTC vs. ITC

For certain renewable generation projects that would qualify for the PTC the facility owner can elect to claim the ITC instead.

A public power agency should consider a number of factors in evaluating whether the PTC or ITC would be more advantageous for a particular project.

The ITC is a one-time payment equal to a percentage of project costs for the date the facility is placed in service. The PTC is a per-MWh payment based on actual production over the first ten years of facility operation that is adjusted each year for inflation. It is paid once a year based on the preceding year's production.

An evaluation of the PTC vs. the ITC for a project would include a calculation of the present value of the expected subsidy amounts for each of the credits. Factors relevant to this determination would include the ITC percentage and PTC amount for the project the expected project cost and capacity factor the assumed discount rate and the expected inflation rate. Other considerations would include the potential for future sequestration and the need to send the IRS only one payment request rather than ten.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYmFuZ2xhZGVzaHBvc3QubmV0L3Bvc3RzL2JwYy13aWxsLWZvcm0tYS1zZXBhcmF0ZS1jby1mb3ItcGlwZWxpbmUtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2UtOTY1NDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'BPC will form a separate co for pipeline maintenance',"Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has undertaken the operation of petroleum liquid fuel like gas. The company has started work on forming a separate company for maintenance of petroleum pipelines. A 'Petroleum Transmission Company' is being formed on the model of Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) a gas transmission pipeline construction and maintenance company under Petrobangla. BPC has approved 'Petroleum Transmission Company (PTC-PLC)' as a private limited company. Manpower recruitment process has started and managing director will be appointed after registration of joint stock company registrar.

According to BPC sources this project has been undertaken to save cost and time in clearing imported liquid fuel. The cost of the project titled 'Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipeline' has been estimated at Tk 7 thousand 124 crores 62 lakhs. The project is likely to be completed by mid-2023. Again an 8-inch diameter pipeline is being built from Pitalganj in Narayanganj to Kurmitola Aviation Depot in Dhaka to supply aircraft fuel. Tk 249 crores are being spent on the 16 km long pipeline. The work of the project is almost at the final stage.

Eastern Refinery Managing Director Engineer Md. Lokman said that the commissioning will begin at various operational points of the SPM project within the next few months. BPC has already decided to form PTC-PLC for operation and maintenance of these pipelines. Single Point Mooring (SPM) Dhaka-Chittagong Pipeline and India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline projects are nearing completion. Eastern Refinery has started a recruitment process for a full workforce of 119 people for 50 posts. PTC-PLC will start its official activities with the appointment of the managing director after receiving the registration of the Registrar. Now the manpower recruitment process has started through Eastern Refinery.

BPC said about two and a half kilometers pipeline is being built to transport fuel oil from Chattogram to the capital Dhaka. The cost of this project is 3 thousand 171 crore 85 lakh taka. Similarly BPC is constructing a 131 km pipeline to bring imported oil from India's Numaligarh refinery. The work on the project named India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline has progressed more than 90 percent. All pipelines could be operational by 2023.

Meanwhile BPC has taken steps to recruit manpower in preparation for setting up a petroleum transmission company. Eastern Refinery has started recruitment of 119 people for 50 posts. Eastern Refinery has issued a recruitment notification in the newspaper.

BPC Director (Operation and Planning) Khalid Ahmed convener of the committee said that in the coming years fuel oil transportation activities will be started through pipelines. Meanwhile four pipeline projects including SPM are nearing completion. India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline Chattogram-Dhaka Pipeline Pitalganj-Kurmitola Pipeline are in progress. After the construction of these pipelines new maintenance companies have been formed. The new company is very similar to Petrobangla's GTCL. The company is named Petroleum Transmission Company (PLC). Now applied for registration in Joint Stock Company. After registration another subsidiary organization of BPC will be created.

BPC is worried that they will be complicated in maintenance if fuel oil transportation starts through pipelines. The state-owned company has no previous experience in transporting fuel oil through pipelines by land despite carrying out unloading and supply operations from ships. There is also no policy on fuel oil supply pipeline maintenance. Currently under construction pipeline projects are being implemented by Eastern Refinery Limited and Padma Oil Company Limited. New manpower will be needed when the pipelines come into operation. Considering these BPC took steps to form a separate company for the maintenance and operation of fuel oil supply pipelines in the future. For this a high level committee was constituted by convening the BPC Director (Operations & Planning).

The committee includes BPC Secretary Member Secretary and General Manager (Planning & Development) General Manager (Accounts) Managing Director of Padma and Jamuna Oil Managing Director of Petrobangla subsidiary GTCL Company Secretary of Eastern Lubricants Blenders Limited (ELBL) and BPC Legal Advisor as members. BPC has completed all preparations for the formation of Petroleum Pipeline Transmission Company in view of the recommendations of the committee. Approval has been received from the Ministry for formation of the new company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vZ29vZC1uZXdzLXNpbmdlci1uaW5qYS1ibGVzc2VkLXdpdGgtYmFieS1ib3nSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5wdGNwdW5qYWJpLmNvLmluL2FtcC9nb29kLW5ld3Mtc2luZ2VyLW5pbmphLWJsZXNzZWQtd2l0aC1iYWJ5LWJveQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Good news!

This is the first time Speed staff has overhauled its permanent collection on this scale since 2016 according to a news release the museum sent out Tuesday.

The effort began in May as staff started to rearrange its contemporary European American African Indigenous and Kentucky art collections.

The release said this endeavor will pull 30% more of the museum’s art out of storage and display some newly acquired works at the Speed for the first time including pieces by interdisciplinary artist Maia Cruz Palileo photographer Paul Mpagi Sepuya and contemporary artist Jeffrey Gibson.

In addition to displaying more art Speed staff are in the process of reinstalling works thematically rather than geographically or chronologically. In a news release curators say this will provide important cultural context and spark new interpretations.

“This reinstallation is a timely opportunity to reflect on the strengths of our collection and maximize its potential bringing new works on display for the first time and placing celebrated icons from the canon of art history in conversation with artists working at the forefront of contemporary and historically marginalized traditions” chief curator Erika Holmquist-Wall who is leading the reinstallation work said in the release.

“By breathing life into our collections with fresh perspectives and juxtapositions we hope to transform the museum experience and inspire new takeaways for visitors” she continued.

Speed director Raphaela Platow said the effort will elevate “the power of a diverse range of artistic perspectives and build on our commitment to tell stories that matter through our collections and exhibitions.”

Visitors can already see some of this reinstallation work in the contemporary galleries which reopened last month in a new location inhabiting walls and spaces on the first floor near the main entrance.

“I hope to offer visitors the opportunity to enter the museum and immediately come across artworks that speak to the complex social issues of our times as well as the dynamic aesthetic developments in artmaking today” curator of contemporary art Tyler Blackwell said in the release.

A spokesperson for the museum told WFPL News Speed leadership was motivated in part to take on the reinstallation following the 2021 exhibition “Promise Witness Remembrance” which paid tribute to Breonna Taylor.

The museum worked with Taylor’s family and people close to issues like racism and police brutality to develop the show.

After Platow stepped into the role as director last year she Holmquist-Wall and eventually Blackwell had conversations about how they could re-envision the museum’s permanent collections in a way that is more responsive to themes or subject matter the local community can connect with.

The Speed will also conduct a two-year examination of its Indigenous and African art collections.

The release said the museum intends to work with tribes and communities to learn more about the artwork and show it more thoughtfully.

Museums around the globe have undertaken the work of re-evaluating some of their collections in particular African and Indigenous artwork to better understand how the pieces ended up in their collection and their broader backstories. In some cases the reflection has come from within while other institutions began the process following public scrutiny. Some museums have begun repatriation processes returning pieces to the countries they were stolen from.

The topic of museums collections and something called provenance basically the history of a work’s ownership recently caught the attention of television show host John Oliver. In a recent episode of Last Week Tonight Oliver discussed several ethical issues around western museum collections and auction houses including problematic approaches to acquisition reluctance to repatriation and artifacts sitting in storage indefinitely.

“If I could impress one thing on you it’s that when these objects end up in the West we put them behind glass and we call them ‘art’” Oliver said in the Oct. 3 episode. “But in their home context they can be much more.”

At the Speed curator of academic engagement and special projects fari nzinga will head the work on its Indigenous and African collections.

“I am looking forward to leading an intentional and thoughtful reinstallation of the Native American and African art galleries to bring them into a cohesive nuanced and evocative display in conversation with other areas of the collection” nzinga said.

With the announcement of the reinstallation work Platow shared that the Speed will resume pre-pandemic hours starting Oct. 21 returning to a five-day-a-week schedule and being open to the public Wednesday through Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYXJlZm9vdC5jb20vc2VsZi1zdG9yYWdlL25ld3MvMTE1NzEtcWEtaGFydmVzdC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWJyaW5ncy1tYW4tY2F2ZXMtdG8tc2VsZi1zdG9yYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Q&A: Harvest Property Management brings 'man caves' to self-storage,"Jordan Wright started Harvest Property Management in Wichita KS in October 2020 – right in the heart of the pandemic.

“It was kind of a crazy time to start a business but we took that leap of faith and have been growing ever since” said Wright director of operations and owner of Harvest Property Management.

Harvest became property manager Oct. 1 at MoreStor Self Storage in east Wichita at 143rd Street East and Kellogg and introduced a novel concept—man caves for rent.

Harvest which manages the Cox Produce building in Old Town Midtown place Apartments near 8th and Waco and east Wichita’s Spanish Villas now faces the challenge of marketing man caves – and to stress renting not owning to potential customers.

H. Percy Vanderslice LLC owns MoreStor Self Storage which opened in 2020 at 368 S. 143rd East in Wichita. It has 55200 square feet of self-storage space and 24000 square feet of flex space for the 24 man caves.

“They were built identically some with additional walls that were added; some walls were taken out” Wright said. “One thousand square feet is the standard but we have some that go to 2000 or 3000.”

Wright said 21 man caves were occupied as of Oct. 1.

He said his company aims to add more commercial properties outside of Wichita in both Kansas and Missouri. To find out more continue reading the rest of our conversation below.

How do you market the man caves?

Jordan Wright: A couple of different ways. For small businesses we can offer it as an incubator or to be used for product distribution. We’re also marketing man cave sites at car shows and to some of the hobbyists in the area looking for a place to park their luxury vehicles. They may not want to store them in their home garage.

We have people that run businesses out of them such as landscaping or electrical work and product distributors such as for beverages or clothing.

What is the rental cost?

It starts at $850 per month. That’s the base model with no air conditioning no garage door opener (they use manual entry instead). If you want to add any of those things we amortize them over the life of the lease (one year minimum) and your rent increases by the same amount.

We have a bathroom in every space so they don’t have to worry about using the public restroom. Every unit is individually metered for room temperature; they have full control over it.

It’s a good place to just get away. Some have a couch and big-screen TV to listen to while they tinker with the car or whatever it is that they do.

The biggest objection is they expect a [lower] monthly price as they have that conventional self-storage mindset not looking to spend $1000 today. We can refer them back to their traditional self-storage model; we can meet their needs.

Why rentals rather than sales?

The owner who built this place had previously sold them as condo-like units with the thought of a one-time profit. But we lease them out and get recurring revenue from this.

How have you grown the number of employees from eight in October 2020 to 19 today?

When we started this we had one retail building we were managing. From there we grew into additional commercial and retail buildings and started getting into managing duplexes and apartment complexes. Now we have a maintenance staff and apartment managers. It takes a team to run these things. For example we have a 320-unit building here in Wichita and we assign four employees to it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZGV4dHJhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjIvb2N0LzExL2FycmVzdHMtbWFkZS1ydi1yZWNvdmVyZWQtYWZ0ZXItdGhlZnQtZnJvbS1lYWdsZS1tb3VudGFpbi1zdG9yYWdlLWZhY2lsaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arrests made RV recovered after theft from Eagle Mountain storage facility,"1 / 3 The stolen trailer that was recovered on Saturday Oct. 8 2022.

Arrests were made on Saturday for the theft of an RV originally stolen in late August after someone gave a tip to law enforcement.

An RV was stolen from Sunset Storage & RV a self-storage facility located in Eagle Mountain on Aug. 23. The Utah County Sheriff’s Office released a statement on Aug. 31 asking for the public’s help in identifying suspects who were captured on security cameras at a nearby Holiday Oil gas station prior to the theft.

A tipster identified the woman in the security footage as Salt Lake City resident Dana Leigh Conley 45. Detectives later ID’d the man as feelow Salt Lake resident Matthey Allan Rushton 42.

Rushton and Conley were taken into custody on Saturday while detectives were conducting surveillance on the pair. Detectives saw Rushton get out of a pickup truck at a VASA Fitness Center in Saratoga Springs while Conley stayed in the car.

“Rushton entered and left the building several times. On one time coming out he was carrying property he was not carrying when he entered the building” reads a press release from the UCSO. “As Rushton got in the truck and began to drive away a Sheriff’s Office Sergeant stopped the truck. Rushton and Conley were taken into custody without incident.”

Rushton and Conley were booked by Saratoga Springs Police on burglary and theft charges for entering and stealing from the Saratoga Springs VASA Fitness.

Rushton and Conley were booked into the Utah County Jail early Sunday morning on three charges of possession of a stolen vehicle. Both are being held on a total bail of $36000.

Conley admitted to being in the truck with Rushton when the two allegedly stole the RV in late August. In addition to the RV valued at $45000 Conley also admitted that she and Rushton were involved in the theft of two utility trailers as well as other property.

“Those trailers with a very large quantity of stolen property were located in a remote area of Utah County near Holdaway Canyon. That is located in the southwest area of Utah County in Cedar Valley south of Twelve Mile Canyon” reads a press release from the UCSO. “There was a fourth trailer at that location which Conley said she knew nothing about.”

The total value of stolen items comes to $70000.

PWR,Quanta Services,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5zcG9uc29yLmNvbS9xdWFudGEtc2VydmljZXMtc3VlZC1lcmlzYS1sYXdzdWl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quanta Services Sued in ERISA Lawsuit | PLANSPONSOR,"Two former employees of Quanta Services in late September brought a class action suit against the company under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act alleging that Quanta had maintained underperforming and expensive investment options in its sponsored retirement plan.

Quanta Services an electrical power company sponsored a retirement plan that covered 16317 participants with $1.21 billion in assets as of December 21 2020 according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that a plan of this size should have greater bargaining power to negotiate lower fees. The plan however kept high-cost and underperforming actively managed funds when better alternatives were available such as passive index funds according to the plaintiffs.

The suit preempts a common argument made by defendants in ERISA cases that the funds maintained by a sponsor cannot be fairly compared to higher-performing competitors because “competitors are not comparators.”

To address this “apples and oranges” problem the lawsuit alleges that the point of actively managed funds is to outperform index funds in order to justify their higher cost. Their reason for existence is comparative: to grow faster than passive funds and justify their higher management cost. This makes them ripe for comparison the lawsuit alleges and their inclusion in a plan when better passive funds are available violates the fiduciary’s duty of prudence and duty to monitor on behalf of participants.

The plan sponsor did not compare active fund to index plans however and also kept an active target date fund as the plan’s “Qualified Default Investment Alternative” or QDIA. A QDIA is a default investment that a plan may offer as a recommendation to participants that lack the knowledge or confidence to select their own and their assets would be invested in the QDIA if they do not select a fund themselves.

The plaintiffs allege that an active TDF should not have been the QDIA since active funds typically underperform passive funds in the long run. To this end the plaintiffs cited data showing that passive funds gained $40 billion in net inflows from 2016 to 2020 and active funds suffered $35 billion in net outflows over the same time period reflecting a collective market endorsement of passive over active according to the complaint. They also allege that actively managed funds tend to contain more high-risk assets such as high-yield bonds.

Specifically the suit noted the American Beacon Small Cap Value Fund and the DFA International Small Cap Value Fund both of which according to the complaint underperformed their own benchmarks for several consecutive quarters. Since Quanta did not remove these funds in a timely manner it failed its duty to prudently monitor their retirement options costing the plaintiffs and the class money in their total savings.

Active funds are not considered a per se violation of ERISA.

Quanta Services did not return a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hcGlwZWxpbmVzLmNvbS9sZWFkaW5nLWZyb20tdGhlLWhlYXJ0LXJvYmVydC1vc2Jvcm4tMjAyMi1waXBlbGluZS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWF3YXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leading From the Heart: Osborn Wins Pipeline Leadership Award,"By Brad Kramer View Profile

To this year’s recipient of the Pipeline Leadership Award being a leader boils down to respect and speaking from the heart.

Having worked his way up through the pipeline business Robert C. “Bob” Osborn has built a reputation based on hard work trust among his colleagues and a passion for the safety of all pipeliners. An oft-repeated descriptor for Osborn is “always available” or “always accessible.”

Osborn’s leadership has led to the successful completion of numerous energy pipeline projects throughout his 40 years in the industry. It’s this reputation for safety and hard work that has earned Osborn the 2022 Pipeline Leadership Award. The annual award will be presented at the Pipeline Leadership Conference Nov. 15-16 in Houston organized by Benjamin Media Inc. publisher of North American Energy Pipelines in cooperation with Continuum Capital.

As president of Michels Energy Group a wholly owned subsidiary of Michels Corporation Osborn is responsible for all aspects of pipeline natural gas distribution and electrical power construction operations across the United States.

“The reputation Bob has built for Michels pipeline construction services and the quality of the team he has assembled speaks for itself” says Pat Michels president and CEO of Michels Corporation. “Beyond that Bob is respectful of the pipeline industry’s past at the same time he is leading it into the future to support energy transition needs.”

He joined Michels in 2001 as vice president of pipeline construction operations. In ensuing years Osborn helped to grow Michels into one of the largest full‐service pipeline contractors in North America. He was promoted to senior group president of energy in 2019 before taking the helm at Michels Energy Group.

Outside of his duties at Michels Osborn is an active participant in the industry having been elected president of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA) in 2017 and serving on the PLCA board of directors PLCA Labor Negotiating Committee International Labors Training Steering Committee and Teamsters Pension Fund.

“Bob Osborn embodies the work ethic safety commitment and dedication prevalent in the hard-working folks who build a critical part of America’s energy infrastructure” said Mike Prior P.Eng. senior strategic advisor Michels Canada. “Bob’s experience and personal integrity make him an effective energizing leader regardless of whether he is visiting with crews in the field asking hundreds of workers on a spread to focus on safety or interacting with executives and political leaders.”

Family Legacy

Osborn was born into a pipeliner family as his father worked for a pipeline contractor. His brothers are involved in the industry as well. He started right out of high school as a laborer for Donaldson Construction a pipeline contractor based in Dodge Center Minnesota and he worked his way up to welder helper teamster operator and continued climbing the rungs until he was given a chance at a management role.

After Donaldson Construction shut down it was Mueller Pipelines that gave Osborn his first shot at management at age 26 running the Kansas City area operations. Seven years later at age

33 he was promoted to president of the company.

Mueller was eventually sold and later became part of Quanta Services. Osborn decided to pursue a new opportunity that more aligned with his values.

“I was always coming from family companies” Osborn says regarding his motivation to join Michels Corporation in 2001.

When Osborn made the decision to return to a family-owned pipeline company he joined an organization led by second-generation president and CEO Pat Michels whose father Dale Michels founded the company in 1959. As vice president of the company’s pipeline division Osborn reported to another industry legend in Bob Westphal. Osborn eventually succeeded Westphal.

“I was fortunate that when Bob was going to slow down but not retire he was a great resource for me” Osborn says of his relationship with Westphal. “Pat asked if I was OK with Bob staying involved. I was more than OK because I could bounce ideas off Bob and Pat said I should use Bob in that way.”

What attracted Osborn to Michels was the company’s reputation in the pipeline industry.

“If one thing resonated with me about Michels prior to working with the company it’s that they always had such a strong reputation of doing tough jobs and always finishing the job” Osborn says. “It was their reputation and being a family-owned business.”

Osborn also respected the company’s culture of a strong work ethic.

“It’s just a great story in the way the company grew” Osborn says. “They have such a strong work ethic and after having been here awhile I see where that came from. It came from Dale Michels and he passed that down to his family.”

Pat and his brother Kevin Michels continue that hardworking legacy Osborn says while adding that they also provide strong support and leeway for their employees.

“Everyone sees that model every day and it gets bred through the whole company” Osborn says. “You’re expected to work hard because they work hard. That’s what brought me to Michels.”

Industry Respect

Having worked his way up through the pipeline industry Osborn has earned the respect of his peers and those who work for him.

“Bob literally grew up in the pipeline industry starting as a laborer and advancing into the highest levels of leadership” Pat Michels says. “He brings a unique perspective as a pipeliner and a businessperson which allows him to focus on the sustainability of the industry as well as the importance of the invaluable people who perform the work. In the industry and at Michels Bob is unflinchingly committed to safety quality and environmental performance making him an important steward of the pipeline industry.”

With his father as an example Osborn advanced through hard work and learning the business from the inside.

“As a young man I was working with guys my father’s age” Osborn says. “The way I got respect was because I knew so much about the business.”

However Osborn also stresses the importance of being respectful of others.

“If you want to be respected” he says “you have to be respectful.”

Richard Prior president of liquids pipelines for TC Energy calls Osborn a “stalwart leader” in the industry.

“(Osborn) leads with safety integrity and looks for common ground solutions with his clients and has strong enthusiasm for our industry” Prior says. “Bob has assembled excellent construction teams throughout the years with a partnership approach executing our pipeline and facilities construction projects.”

Prior witnessed Osborn’s leadership firsthand while developing one of the biggest pipeline projects in history.

“Bob showed tremendous leadership while we were developing the Keystone XL project” Prior says. “He helped coordinate vocal support for the project throughout the pipeline industry including with the contractor community the building trade unions and various local and state politicians.”

Prior sees Osborn’s impact in the pipeline industry as enduring.

“An area that stands out is that he consistently demonstrates how to bring groups together to find solutions to our challenges” Prior says. “Bob finds common ground with labor construction contractors owners and construction management to solve issues.”

Osborn is proud of the path his career has taken.

“I’m proud of my roots and my background in pipeline work but I’m also proud to have the opportunity to work next to great leaders in the industry. I’ve always had good leaders who pushed me to do better. You have to be willing to be pushed and accept the challenges. I’ve also been fortunate to be surrounded by the Michels team I work with day to day.”

Bob Osborn stands with Roger Monk a semi-retired welder who works with Michels and Steamfitters Local 601 to train union pipeline welders. They were featured in an episode of the TV show “Building Wisconsin.”

Speaking from the Heart

There is a sign that hangs on the wall in Osborn’s office. It reads: “Authority is a very dangerous thing and ruins more men than it makes. No man amounts to anything by himself and can only rise by the friendship and loyalty of those around him which can only be secured by thoughtfulness courtesy and fairness.”

The quote comes from Robby Gilliand who was president of Midland Constructors an overhead powerline company in Minnesota. Osborn never worked for Gilliand but he describes him as a quiet man and a family friend who tragically died in an auto accident. Osborn encountered this bit of wisdom at a friend’s house.

“When I saw it it just made so much sense to me” Osborn says. “When people get in higher positions of power they can lose their respect for others. To me this is how to grow into a leader. I’ve kept it with me for years and I try to live by it.”

Because of those words of wisdom Osborn believes in taking pride in what you do and being respectful of other people. It’s this heartfelt belief that drives Osborn as a leader.

“The biggest thing for me is that you should always lead with your heart” he says. “Your heart will lead the way. I don’t always make the most conventional decision but I try to think in that way.”

One of the decisions Osborn takes pride in is furthering Michels’ commitment to safety.

“Safety has always been a big part of what we do here. One of the things I’m proud of in my career is helping Michels build one of biggest and best safety cultures in the industry.”

As part of that effort Osborn was instrumental in the hiring of Sean Nicholson as vice president of health safety and environment (HSE) for Michels who joined the company in 2007. Nicholson highlights Osborn’s passion for looking after the people who work for him.

“Bob is always engaged in driving the culture at Michels” Nicholson says. “He relentlessly cares about making sure the women and men who work for the company go home safe. He rarely balked at any HSE initiatives we wanted to put in place. He was always heavily involved and the people who worked for him knew his passion for safety.”

Nicholson sees Osborn’s impact on the pipeline industry as “profound.”

“He is very well regarded because he’s not pretentious” Nicholson says. “He wants to do right thing globally not just competitively. He pours his heart and soul into projects and he’s willing to roll his sleeves up and not brag about who he is. He’s willing to put his blood sweat and tears into the industry. From my experience and I’ve been in the industry now for 20 years I’ve never seen someone who is built the way he is.”

Always Accessible

One of attributes that distinguishes Osborn as a leader according to his colleagues is his accessibility.

“Bob has set a very high standard of expectations and then assembled a nationwide team to enact his vision” Michels says. “He is always accessible and available when needed yet trusts his team to perform work and to act in accordance with Michels standards. In addition Bob is also a visible leader frequently visiting jobsites and meeting with crews. He is as comfortable meeting with crews in the field as he is with executives in a boardroom. He exemplifies Michels Core Values at every step along the way.”

Nicholson says it’s Osborn’s accessibility that helps build trust.

“He’s always available always a leader but he has the ability to put a personal touch on that aspect” Nicholson says. “He’s able to lean into that personal side and hold himself up personally. That builds trust and lets the barrier come down. That’s why he’s so successful. The name Bob Osborn resonates throughout industry.”

Although Osborn has had innumerable role models in the pipeline industry including Michels and Westphal it was Osborn’s parents Richard “Dick” Osborn Jr. and Norma Osborn who set him on his path.

“How do you develop good work ethic good morals and standards? Really I developed that through my parents” Osborn says. “There were seven of us kids with eight years between the oldest and youngest. Dad traveled all the time so Mom managed us all. Thinking back how they dealt with crises and challenges I learned about that through them.”

Osborn also credits his wife Londa for providing support and guidance throughout his career.

“My wife knew when we met how committed I was to the industry” he says. “It’s not easy to do but she raised our five kids. Next year will be our 40th anniversary. Her understanding and patience has given me the opportunity to do what I do.”

Role of a Leader

One of the most important aspects of being a leader Osborn says is listening to other people.

“I think one of biggest things with leadership is that good leaders have to know how to listen” he says. “You have to lead with your ears. Also as a leader you have to be cognizant of what you say when you speak and you have to speak from the heart.”

Osborn believes that it’s through listening that leaders solve problems.

“That’s how I learn by hearing what other people say and finding solutions for them” he says.

It’s also important to listen to other leaders Osborn says.

“Good leaders have to be willing to listen and seek advice” he says. “Sometimes you have to make tough decisions but you also have to make swift decisions especially in the field.”

Being visible is another attribute that Osborn believes is essential for a leader.

“Leaders should lead by example because people watch what you do” he says. “If you work hard they’ll want to work hard. I never think of myself as a leader even though I know I’m a leader but I don’t look at it in those terms. You have to be visible and put the time in. But you have to be willing to listen to people’s problems and help find solutions.”

At a recent Automotive Investor Day event in New York City Qualcomm executives updated the company’s automotive design win pipeline to $30 billion and took a deep dive into how the digitalization of vehicles is a major growth engine for its products. During the program executives from major global automotive OEMs appeared to discuss their partnerships with Qualcomm.

In March Qualcomm announced it’s working with BMW Group and Arriver Software on cooperative development of automated driving technologies including the use of the Snapdragon Ride Platform vision compute and connectivity capabilities.

BMW CEO Oliver Zipse noted that the firms have worked together for a decade and looked ahead to the 2025 launch of the company’s cluster architecture for electric vehicles. “Snapdragon platforms create world-class digital experiences and our customers enjoy this everyday around the world” he said. “Our goal: the joint development of first-class next-generation driver assistance technologies—this ranges from safety features to advanced solutions for Level 3 automated driving…Together we are developing trend-setting technologies for the future of digital and fully-connected mobility.”

General Motors CEO Mary Barra called out the automaker’s “once-in-a-lifetime transformation to electric and autonomous vehicles which is reshaping our approach to technology and innovation…It is essential to partner with the right companies…to foster innovation and deliver the very best vehicles services and experience to our customers.”

Qualcomm and GM have a long-term and wide-ranging arrangement covering digital cockpits vehicle telematics and advanced driver assistance systems.

In May Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor debuted its Mocca DHT-PHEV LIDAR Edition vehicles which uses the Snapdragon Digital Chassis including connectivity and cockpit platforms. Great Wall Motors CTO Yuanli Wang said the company wants to become “a global technology-driven mobility company. Qualcomm has been an important technology provider and a close partner.” He also called out “joint development” on C-V2X connectivity.

Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said the company is using the third-generation Snapdragon Cockpit Platform into the U.S. market from the second half of 2022 bringing improvements in graphics performance and usability. “In 2023 we will provide this model to the customers around the world. We would like to enhance the bigger information tool in the connected area through a stronger and better partnership with Qualcomm and to work together in order to provide high value-added products and expanding our services which will satisfy our customers.”

Beginning in 2023 Qualcomm technologies will power Mercedes-Benz’s digital cockpits. CEO Ola Kallenius discussed how “luxury is in large part created in our customers perception. They have to see feel and experience and I am certain digital luxury done right adds a lot of value to that equation. That is why we’re incredibly pleased to extend our more than 10 years of successful collaboration with Qualcomm to keep working together on one of the most decisive and fascinating parts of future cars—the digital cockpit.”

Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares described a “race to transform Stellantis…into a sustainble mobility tech company…We are confident the Snapdragon Digital Chassis will give us the horsepower we need to win to create the most intelligent customizable and immersive in-cabin experiences.” The two companies are working together across all 14 Stellantis brands to bring Snapdragon-powered experiences to vehicles beginning in 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY25ldnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvbmV0YS1sYXVuY2hlcy11LWlpLXF1YWxjb21tLTgxNTUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neta launches Neta U-II brings Qualcomm 8155 chip to budget EV,"Previously models using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip in the smart cockpit cost twice as much as the model from Neta.

While flagship electric vehicle (EV) models use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip as a selling point Neta Automobile an EV brand owned by Hozon Auto has unexpectedly made its budget models use the flagship chip as well.

Neta today made the Neta U-II electric SUV officially available in China as the successor to the previously offered Neta U.

Neta is offering four models for the Neta U-Ⅱ priced as follows:

The U-Ⅱ 400 Lite starts at RMB 129800 ($18220). The U-Ⅱ 400 starts at RMB 136800 U-Ⅱ 500 starts at RMB 147800 The U-Ⅱ 600 starts at RMB 159800.

With the exception of the lowest priced U-Ⅱ 400 Lite the smart cockpit in all versions is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip a high-end chip previously used only in models priced over RMB 300000.

Given that the Snapdragon 8155 chip enables a smoother experience especially with the touchscreen in the cockpit it is considered a must for high-end models and it is surprising that Neta is using it in an inexpensive model.

On May 1 Voyah a subsidiary of Dongefeng Motor began allowing Voyah FREE owners to pay to upgrade to the Qualcomm 8155 chip at a price of RMB 12999.

On June 15 Nio announced its new SUV ES7 with an Alder smart system based on Qualcomm's 8155 chip allowing existing ES8 ES6 and EC6 owners to pay for the upgrade at a price of RMB 9600.

Geely's premium EV subsidiary Zeekr announced a free program for Zeekr 001 owners to upgrade their cockpit chip to Qualcomm 8155 on July 11.

Ford announced on the opening day of the Chengdu auto show on August 26 that it will upgrade the cabin chip to the Snapdragon 8155 for Mustang Mach-E consumers for free.

The prices of these models with Qualcomm 8155 chips are all above RMB 300000.

Neta said the Neta U-II powered by the Qualcomm 8155 chip is the ceiling for smart cockpits on models priced in the RMB 150000 range.

Neta also allows consumers of the three higher-priced models to buy its assisted driving package which starts at RMB 8800.

The assisted driving system is built on the Journey 3 chip from local chipmaker Horizon Robotics and Neta said it offers L2.5 driving assistance with 22 sensing hardware.

In terms of vehicle specifications the Neta U-II like the Neta U is a compact SUV with a length width and height of 4549 mm 1860 mm and 1628 mm respectively and a wheelbase of 2770 mm.

The Neta U-II has three options in terms of CLTC range: 401 km 501 km and 610 km.

The model is powered by a permanent magnet synchronous motor with a maximum power of 120 kW and a maximum torque of 210 Nm for the three lower-priced versions and an acceleration time of less than 9.5 seconds from 0-100 km/h.

The highest-priced version has an electric motor with a maximum power of 170 kW and a maximum torque of 310 Nm with a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of less than 7 seconds.

Neta did not announce when deliveries of the model will begin. It delivered 18005 vehicles in September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzExLzIzMzk4NzkzL21ldGEtcXVlc3QtcHJvLXNuYXBkcmFnb24teHIyLXBsdXMtdnItY2hpcC1mZWF0dXJlLW5ld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Meta Quest Pro will feature the new Snapdragon XR2 Plus VR chip,"Meta finally showed off its Quest Pro virtual reality (VR) headset at its Connect event on Tuesday revealing that the high-end device will sport the new Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 1 chip. Qualcomm says the chip offers 50 percent higher sustained power and 30 percent better thermal performance than the XR2 Gen 1 chip included in the Meta Quest 2.

The Quest Pro headset features 12GB of RAM 256GB of storage and 10 high-res sensors distributed on both the inside and outside of the headset with the XR2 Plus Gen 1 chip helping to enable face and eye tracking. This technology’s paired with the Snapdragon 662 chip in the Quest Touch Pro controllers that Meta and Qualcomm say “can self-track through multiple embedded positional cameras and offers ultra-low latency to the headset.” Combining the capabilities of both the headset and controllers is supposed to make users’ virtual avatars appear more lifelike.

Meta won’t be the only company that can use the Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 1 chip. Last month Meta announced a multiyear agreement with Qualcomm to power the company’s “future roadmap of Quest devices” as it relies on outside help from the chipmaker instead of custom-designed silicon like many recent products from Apple (for its iPhone and Mac lineup) or Google (with its recent Pixel phones and Tensor chips). Meta has bet big on the metaverse and even changed its name to signal its dedication. The company reported a $2.8 billion loss last quarter while investing heavily in Zuckerberg’s vision of a mixed reality future.

“This latest generation of innovative Snapdragon technology is bringing huge compute gains in our VR form factor enabling us to power much richer experiences in Meta Quest Pro” Mark Rabkin the head of VR at Meta’s Reality Labs said in a statement. “We believe VR and MR [mixed reality] will radically transform how we work collaborate and connect with each other and we’re thrilled to be with Qualcomm Technologies on this journey.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9nYWRnZXRzLW5ld3Mvd2h5LWFwcGxlLW1heS1jb250aW51ZS11c2luZy1xdWFsY29tbS01Zy1tb2RlbXMtZm9yLWZldy1tb3JlLXllYXJzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0Nzg0MzEzLmNtc9IBkAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9nYWRnZXRzLW5ld3Mvd2h5LWFwcGxlLW1heS1jb250aW51ZS11c2luZy1xdWFsY29tbS01Zy1tb2RlbXMtZm9yLWZldy1tb3JlLXllYXJzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDc4NDMxMy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Apple may continue using Qualcomm 5G modems for few more years,Apple is not ditching Qualcomm modems any time soon. The iPhone maker will continue to use Qualcomm 5G modems for at least the next two two generations of iPhones. According to a new research note there is delay in development of in-house chips. The recently-launched iPhone 14 series of smartphones have Snapdragon X65 modem under the hood. Qualcomm launched the X70 modem in February this year.The research note (accessed by ITHome) by Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu suggests that Apple's baseband chips are unlikely to be launched before 2025 and the Cupertino-based company will continue using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon modems.This means that at least the next two generations of iPhone which are likely to be called iPhone 15 and iPhone 16  respectively.The iPhone models that are expected to debut next year may use the Snapdragon X70 modem claimed to provide download speeds of up to 10Gbps and 60% enhanced battery efficiency. The 2024 iPhone models are said to use Qualcomm's yet-to-be-announced Snapdragon X75 modem. The analyst also claims that the Snapdragon X75 is expected to be built on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) 4nm process.Earlier this year famous TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had claimed that Apple had been trying to develop its own 5G modem chip for iPhones and planning to partner with TSMC for the same. Citing a survey conducted by him he claimed that the company has failed to develop its own 5G modem chips in time for the iPhone 15.Qualcomm will remain the exclusive supplier for 5G modem chips for new iPhones with a 100% supply share. In November last year Qualcomm had said that it believed it would supply only 20% of the 5G modem chips to Apple for use in its 2023 iPhone models.

American multinational corporation Qualcomm has picked up over 1.8 million sq ft spread over an entire 20-storey commercial tower in realty developer K Raheja Corp’s information technology park in Hyderabad in one of the largest office lease transactions said persons with direct knowledge of the development.This will be Qualcomm’s largest such office set up anywhere outside of the US.The company will be paying over Rs 3054 crore as rentals over a total term of 15 years including the escalations of 15% every three years as per the terms of the agreement.""The commitment for the large office space at the developer’s nearly completed project Commerzone Madhapur is part of Qualcomm’s growth and consolidation strategy "" said one of the persons mentioned above.The property is currently not part of the K Raheja Corp-backed listed Mindspace Business Parks REIT. However the REIT holds the right of first offer (ROFO) for this asset. The deal for this built-to-suit office is part of a pre-commitment Qualcomm had entered into earlier.Qualcomm already has offices across the country in Mumbai Bengaluru Chennai and Delhi apart from multiple offices in Hyderabad. In Hyderabad alone Qualcomm occupied 1 million sq ft office space across multiple commercial buildings in K Raheja Corp’s Mindspace IT park.The company’s offices in Hyderabad are likely to be part of this consolidation plan.The new office is expected to accommodate over 17000 employees including its existing staff in Hyderabad that is expected to shift here and new hires that will be part of its India growth plan.The project spread over nearly 9 acres is nearly complete and is scheduled to be delivered by the end of this year which is when the company is expected to start operating from here.ET’s email query to Qualcomm and K Raheja Corp remained unanswered until the time of going to press. Transaction advisor JLL India declined to comment for this story.Overcoming the challenge of the work-from-home model office real estate continued to recover across key commercial property markets of India and has made a strong comeback.The first nine months of 2022 have witnessed record net absorptions backed by strong supply completions and healthy pre-commitments.According to a JLL India report net office absorption has recorded a 107% year-on-year jump at 30.3 million sq ft across the top seven cities in the first nine months of 2022 backed by robust supply completions with healthy pre-commitments.Hyderabad in particular has been leading the markets with the highest net absorption. The southern markets of Bengaluru and Hyderabad have been accounting for more than half of the net absorption.While Covid-19 did have an impact on the market the long-term demand for offices from global entities operating from India has been intact. Office occupiers usually take a longer-term view while making leasing decisions and many occupiers are utilising the current situation to get attractive deals from landlords"

The companies didn’t provide financial details of the deal except to say it was an all-cash transaction.

Under the agreement Quest’s laboratories in Twinsburg Ohio and Pittsburgh will provide testing for physicians and patients serviced by LabCare Plus. Akron Ohio-based Summa Health will continue to wholly own and operate its hospital labs providing laboratory services for inpatient and hospital-based outpatient care along with its anatomic pathology services.

Secaucus New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) said the acquisition would provide physicians and patients in Ohio with access to Quest’s test menu broad health plan coverage network of patient access sites throughout the state and lower out-of-pocket costs for many services.

Rutgers University is teaming up with Quest Diagnostics to provide no-cost laboratory tests over the next year to diagnose and manage acute and chronic diseases for uninsured and underinsured patients of the university’s H.O.P.E. Clinic in Plainfield New Jersey.

This will include lab tests for chronic conditions such as diabetes hypertension sexually transmitted infections and Lyme disease.

Under the program clinicians send laboratory orders directly to a nearby Quest patient service center which allows patients to visit immediately after their appointment. The results are transmitted directly back to the clinic for follow up with the patient.

Gianella Burga a physician assistant student at Rutgers who volunteers at the H.O.P.E. Clinic which is owned and operated by the Rutgers School of Health Professions knows first hand how difficult it is for people without insurance to access even the most basic medical care such as lab tests.

“Many of my family members are uninsured and struggle to get testing for conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol. It’s difficult for them to take a day off from work for a doctor’s visit and then another day for tests” said Burga. “This is why I went into medicine: To address these gaps in care.”

Burga is one of about 75 students who volunteer at the H.O.P.E. Clinic which provides free primary care to hundreds of uninsured adults in Plainfield many of whom are Spanish speaking.

One day each week Rutgers faculty and physician assistant students see patients who are trying to manage acute and chronic diseases and provide them with referrals to specialists as well as critical education on managing their health conditions.

For well over a decade the Rutgers physician assistant program has provided free primary care services in various locations throughout the state. The H.O.P.E. Clinic which was opened in 2021 provides an essential service to a city where about 30 percent of residents are uninsured and 39 percent report not having a primary-care provider.

Following through with lab tests can be challenging for this community and compromise their care said Frank Giannelli director of the H.O.P.E. Clinic and an assistant professor in the physician assistant program at Rutgers School of Health Professions.

“If lab tests are required the patient has to find a lab schedule an appointment receive the lab results and bring them back to us for a consultation” Giannelli said. “It’s a multi-step process where at any point something can go wrong or they may find the cost is astronomical and leave. Navigating this process is difficult – especially for non-English speakers – and could ultimately prevent them from getting the treatment they need.”

“This one-stop-shop testing streamlines the process and makes it easier for patients to receive the treatment they need” said Jessica Romero a physician assistant student at Rutgers who works at the clinic.

Quest the world’s leading provider of diagnostic information services has a history of helping underserved and minority communities throughout the nation gain access to the information they need to take control of their health. Recognizing early in the pandemic that COVID-19 was having a disproportionate impact on communities of color the company launched Quest for Health Equity with an initial focus on giving these communities access to COVID-19 testing and critical health care services.

“This has since grown to become a more than $100 million initiative focused on addressing health care disparities” said Ruth Clements vice president and general manager of infectious diseases and immunology at Quest Diagnostics and leader of Quest for Health Equity. “This collaboration with Rutgers is a great example of joining forces to make a difference in underserved communities. As our headquarters is based in New Jersey we are honored to work to address health inequities in our home state with a strong teammate like Rutgers.”

The H.O.P.E. Clinic is one of an estimated 1400 free and charitable clinics in the U.S. that serve about 7 million people annually. Quest’s commitment to the clinic addresses a concern Giannelli sees nationwide.

“Not only does being uninsured make accessing health-related services challenging but people who are uninsured disproportionately use emergency departments for the management of conditions that could easily be managed in the outpatient setting” he said. “Based on the average one-time emergency department visit cost of $1389 free clinics save emergency departments an estimated $9.6 billion each year. When companies such as Quest help reduce barriers to care in uninsured populations it allows clinicians to make realistic treatment plans that will help keep people out of the hospital which is also good for our nation’s health care costs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vYXNjb3B1YnMub3JnL2RvaS8xMC4xMjAwL0NDSS4yMi4wMDEwMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Cancer Diagnoses Still Lagging in the United States in Second Full Year of COVID-19 Pandemic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/CCI.22.00102 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vYXNjb3B1YnMub3JnL2RvaS8xMC4xMjAwL0NDSS4yMi4wMDEwMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2RydWctc2NyZWVuaW5nLW1hcmtldC1pcy1leHBlY3RlZC10by1nZW5lcmF0ZS1hLXJldmVudWUtb2YtdXNkLTIyLTE2LWJpbGxpb24tYnktMjAzMC0tZ2xvYmFsbHktYXQtMTAtNi1jYWdyLXZlcmlmaWVkLW1hcmtldC1yZXNlYXJjaC0zMDE2NDQ3MTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drug Screening Market is expected to generate a revenue of USD 22.16 Billion by 2030 Globally at 10.6% CAGR ...,"The rising drug and alcohol consumption as well as the implementation of rigorous laws demanding drug and alcohol testing as well as regulatory approvals product launches and services will all contribute to market growth.

The Pink Pony initiative is the philanthropic program dedicated to the cure and prevention of this disease supports programs for research screening early detection treatment and patient support.

This year’s campaign builds on the company’s ongoing commitment to raising awareness and funds for the cause with donations raised from annual Pink Pony product initiatives benefiting the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation’s Pink Pony Fund and an international network of nonprofit cancer organizations.

In support of ongoing Pink Pony initiatives the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation recently announced a commitment of $25 million in new grants to expand or establish five cancer centers under the Ralph Lauren name including the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington D.C. and the existing Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Ralph Lauren Center. The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation is working with Conquer Cancer ASCO’s foundation to identify the three additional grant recipients each of whom must have a National Cancer Institute designation.

In support of this year’s campaign the company will donate 100 percent of the purchase price of the new Pink Pony Oxford Shirt and Pink Pony Fleece Hoodie and 25 percent of the purchase price of the new Pink Pony Cashmere Hoodie as well as some classic Polo shirts in pink coloring to the Pink Pony Fund or a network of international cancer associations.

In Italy the proceeds will go to the AIRC Foundation for Cancer Research a non-profit organization that is the first private funding hub for independent cancer research in Italy with a mission to understand prevent and cure cancer through scientific research and prevention awareness. With AIRC’s support more than 5000 researchers at more than 100 institutions are working to make cancer increasingly curable and to improve patients’ quality of life.

Stream it on Paramount+.

In the near-future a far-right group known as the Volunteers has taken over America. They spend their days hunting and killing immigrants queer people and people of color. Rebelling against them are a couple of outsiders — Sarah (Sarah Wharton) and her husband Jarret (Jarret Kerr the film’s co-writer) — who have stationed themselves on the Canadian border as an underground railroad for underrepresented groups to escape the country. In the film’s suspenseful opening featuring kinetic camerawork and close-quarters gunplay Sarah fights two Volunteers in the woods to save Arjay (Brandon Perea) a young gay Filipino man.

The major draw of the director William Sullivan’s dystopian and post-apocalyptic tale however isn’t wholly the frenetic action. It’s also the moral quandary caused by Sarah and Jarret who are keeping a Volunteer named Gabe (Michael Raymond-James) chained to the floor of their barn as a prisoner. How can the pair despise how they are dehumanized when they treat Gabe like a dog? From a film in which the underrepresented are branded with bar codes emerges a fight not just for freedom but also a struggle for one’s principles amid unprincipled people.

Under The Hood Of Ada Lovelace And The AD102 GPU

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Card And Cooler

A couple of weeks back during the GTC 2022 keynote NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the first salvo of GeForce RTX 40 series cards based on the company’s cutting-edge Ada Lovelace GPU architecture. Three cards were unveiled all based on different slices of silicon the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB (AD104) the RTX 4080 16GB (AD103) and the top-end GeForce RTX 4090 (AD102). The dynamic duo of GeForce RTX 4080s are due to arrive next month but today – one day before cards are set to hit store shelves – we get to show you exactly what the flagship GeForce RTX 4090 can do and wow is this thing a powerful beast.Based on the specifications and new features Jensen revealed we came into this article knowing that GeForce RTX 4090 was going to be one heck of graphics card. But over and above whatever gaming performance gains come by way of the massive 76B transistor GPU and new architectural efficiencies many of the key features exclusive to the Ada Lovelace architecture are meant to further boost performance in both gaming and content creation workloads and enhance the overall gaming experience too.Here's a quick hands-on tour of a couple of GeForce RTX 4090 cards one from MSI and the other directly from NVIDIA. After that we’ll get some particulars out of the way check out NVIDIA’s Founder’s Edition card and then we’ll dive in a little deeper and see how the RTX 4090 performs. If times are tight at the moment we’re going to go ahead and warn you to hide your credit cards right now. When you see what this thing can do even GeForce RTX 3090 Ti owners are going to be green with envy...Though NVIDIA has branded this card the GeForce RTX 4090 like its predecessor the RTX 3090 it fits into the same category previously held by NVIDIA's Titan RTX and older Titan-branded cards. As such the GeForce RTX 4090 isn’t solely a product targeted at gamers. Of course powerful GPUs with thousands of cores high clocks gobs of memory and the latest media engines are typically well-suited to content creation and gaming so we did some testing across an array of workloads in an attempt to paint a complete picture of GeForce RTX 4090 performance. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.Before we go any further we want to highlight a couple of previous articles:We have already covered much of the underlying technology at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4090 so we won’t be doing so again here. If you want the full scoop on Ada Lovelace and the new features it brings to the RTX 40 series we recommend checking out our coverage of the architecture and of NVIDIA’s other GTC 2022 announcements. Once you’ve got all of that meat digested you’ll better understand what the GeForce RTX 4090 we’ll be showing you here today is all about.The new AD102-powered GeForce RTX 4090 is beefed-up and enhanced versus the previous-gen GA102-based GeForce RTX 3090 /3090 Ti in almost every way. The AD102 at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4090 is packing 11 GPCs 42 TPCs and 84 SMs versus 7 42 and 84 in the AD102 respectively. All told the AD102 has more CUDA Cores (16384 vs. 10752) more RT Cores (512 vs. 336) and more Tensor Cores (128 vs. 84) versus GA102 and all of those cores are of a newer-generation as well.The AD102 on the GeForce RTX 4090 also has a whopping 12× more L2 cache than the GA102 as well as more texture units and ROPs. In addition to having significantly more resources in the GPU the AD102 further operates at much higher frequencies than the GA102. Whereas the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti offered a typical Boost Clock around 1860MHz the GeForce RTX 4090 operates above 2520MHz and higher temperatures and power permitting. As such the RTX 4090’s texture fillrate and peak compute performance are is more than double the RTX 3090 Ti’s.All of those new cores and much larger cache require transistors to build and the AD102 is definitely on another level over the GA102 in that regard. NVIDIA's Ampere-based previous-gen GA102 is comprised of roughly 28B transistors however the new Ada Lovelace AD102 features a massive jump to over 76 billion. NVIDIA was able to pack in so many transistors by moving to TSMC’s advanced 4N node versus the custom Samsung 8nm process employed for Ampere. In addition though it’s packing roughly 3X the transistors the AD102 is actually smaller than GA102. The AD102 GPU has a die size of 608 mmversus 628.4mmfor the GA102. Keep in mind the AD102 on the GeForce RTX 4090 isn’t fully enabled – 16 SMs are disabled here. Factor in those 16 additional SMs and a theoretical RTX 4090 Ti would have even more CUDA and RT cores.The GeForce RTX 4090 does however have a similar memory configuration to its predecessors. 24GB of GDDR6X memory is linked to the GPU via a 384-bit memory interface operating at an effective data rate of 21.2Gbps. That equates to just over 1TB/s of peak memory bandwidth. Though NVIDIA didn’t talk much about any new memory compression technologies we suspect the much larger caches in Ada reduce transactions out to frame buffer memory and ultimately improve efficiency as it relates to memory bandwidth utilization.In addition to increasing cores and cache those additional transistors were also used to enable many new features in the Ada Lovelace architecture like Shader Execution Reordering (SER) Displaced Micro-Meshes Opacity Micro-Masks FP8 inferencing a much faster Optical Flow Accelerator and DLSS 3 with AI Frame Generation. The AD102 also features a new 8th-gen media engine which incorporates dual AV1 encoders along with all of the encoding / decoding capabilities of previous-gen architectures. For details on these features please check our previous coverage here Despite all of the new technology at play here we should also mention that GeForce RTX 40 series cards like the RTX 4090 are native PCIe 4.0 – not PCIe 5. However we are still not saturating the current PCIe 4 interface with these graphics cards so the additional bandwidth that would have been afforded by PCIe 5 probably wouldn’t mean much at this point.Something new on the cards that is somewhat similar to the RTX 30 series is a small PCIe Gen 5 power connector. This single 12-pin connection is able to scale up to 600 watts for power delivery and shrinks the overall connector footprint versus existing 6/8-pin PCIe power connectors. NVIDIA includes an adapter with the RTX 4090 that converts a quartet of traditional 8-pin PCIe connectors to the new mini-12-pin design should you need one though ATX 3.0 power supplies are also coming down the pipeline that will natively sport the mini PCIe 5.0 connector and are able to supply enough power to beasts like the RTX 4090 through a single cable. We should point out however not all of NVIDIA’s board partners have adopted the mini-12-pin connector on their designs; some will stick with full-sized 8-pin connectors on their cards.In addition to being able to feed the cards with copious power NVIDIA has also optimized the VRM on the GeForce RTX 4090 for better performance and the cards’ cooling solution has been optimized to better manage the heat that comes with using all that power.The GeForce RTX 4090’s PCB is outfitted with 23 power phases (20 for the GPU 3 for the memory). And full PID transient control is supported for what NVIDIA claims is a 10x increase in power management response times. These advancements allow GeForce RTX 40 series cards to respond to workload demands much faster than previous-gen cards and overall power delivery should be more reliable and consistent.Although the cooling solution on the GeForce RTX 4090 looks similar to the RTX 3090’s it has been internally redesigned. The GeForce RTX 4090 has slightly larger higher-performing fans a new vapor chamber design and a new heatsink layout. The new design results in 20% more airflow and it pulls heat away from the GPU more efficiently without generating more noise. By using higher density more power efficient memory (built by Micron on a more advanced process) NVIDIA was able to situate all of the RAM on one side of the PCB. The new cooler design also makes better contact with the memory. All told memory temperatures should remain roughly 10°C cooler than previous-gen cards and as you’ll see a little later the GPU doesn’t get particularly warm either even after hours of sustained load.Similar to previous high-end Founder’s Edition cards the GeForce RTX 4090’s cooler is outfitted with dual axial fans and it features a split pass-through heatsink design. The pass-through cooler on the GeForce RTX 4090 is partially enabled by its dense short PCB. One end of the heatsink is attached to a vapor chamber that’s mounted directly to the GPU and memory. The fan above that section directs air through the heatsink and immediately funnels it out of the chassis through large vents in the RTX 4090’s case bracket. The heatsink on the back half of the card which is linked to the front vapor chamber via multiple heat-pipes allows air from the second fan to pass all the way through the card where it is propelled upward and is eventually exhausted from a system assuming it’s got decent ventilation.Like the RTX 3090 the new GeForce RTX 4090 is one heck of a big graphics card. In fact it’s slightly wider than a 3090 and measures in at 304mm (L) x 137mm (H) and requires 3-slots (61mm). As we’re sure you’ve seen in the many memes floating around the last couple of weeks many partner boards are even larger.The GeForce RTX 4090 has triple full-sized DisplayPorts (1.4a) and a single HDMI 2.1 output also similar to previous-gen cards. Ada’s display engine hasn’t been updated significantly versus Ampere mostly due to timing according to NVIDIA. The Ada Lovelace design was locked in before newer display output standards had been finalized.In terms of feature support there’s a lot more to mention like NVIDIA Reflex latency reduction technology  NVIDIA Broadcast Ansel G-SYNC Omniverse optional Studio drivers and GeForce Experience to name just a few. Almost everything supported by previous-gen cards is also supported by Ada Lovelace and the RTX 40 series – except NVLink. You’ll notice there’s no NVLink connector on the RTX 4090 so traditional SLI setups are no more.When you see how fast the GeForce RTX 4090 is however you probably won’t care...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0eC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL3ZldGVyYW5zLXN1cHBvcnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News | Supporting veterans on many fronts,"Food security

Brian Keith sought out a few volunteer opportunities when he started at Collins Aerospace a Raytheon Technologies business. One of them hit especially close to home.

Keith who served eight years in the U.S. Army before joining Collins in 2020 spent a Thursday morning at the Mt. Carmel Veterans Service Center in Colorado Springs where he and his colleagues packed bag after bag with granola bars canned goods and boxes of macaroni and cheese then loaded them into more than 100 waiting cars.

“There were a lot of different emotions with a lot of people” said Keith a former Black Hawk helicopter pilot who now works as a program manager on interiors for military aircraft. “A lot of people were really thankful and it was awesome.”

The food distribution marked the beginning of Raytheon Technologies’ recent effort to provide food security for military families. The company has expanded its partnership with Feeding America through a three-year $3 million investment in the nonprofit’s Equitable Food Access and Military Hunger Advocacy initiatives.

The investment:

Helps food banks across the U.S. distribute nutritious food to communities most in need including military communities.

Enables these food banks to start or expand local programs to act on racial and geographical barriers to food access.

Helps food banks identify legislative solutions and work with lawmakers to address hunger among military families.

For Keith who now serves in the U.S. Army Reserves it’s a way to continue supporting his fellow service members as he did when he was in the military full-time.

“I’ve seen a lot of people who got out and are having financial issues” he said. “There are definitely a lot of people affected and I think it’s really important to support veterans. I would do that for any of my brothers in arms.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWRpdGNoZWQtcnR4LTQwOTAtdGktd2h5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Real Reason Why NVIDIA Ditched The RTX 4090 Ti,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWRpdGNoZWQtcnR4LTQwOTAtdGktd2h5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In fact it almost didn’t happen.

During an interview with W Magazine the Compton superstar discussed the making of his fourth studio album and shared the trials and tribulations that came along with it.

More from VIBE.com

Lamar 35 confessed that behind the scenes there was an intense internal struggle as he conceived Mr. Morale. He also expressed to the outlet that he’s naturally “a private person” so creating the brutally honest content was hard for him.

“I’m a private person; it was tough for me” the Pulitzer Prize winner confessed. “I could have cut corners and got flashy with it and worded my words a certain way—nah I had to be in the rawest truest form I could possibly be in order for it to be freeing for me in order for me to have a different outlook and the perspective on people I’m talking to.”

“I had to reap whatever consequences came behind that and also be compassionate and show empathy if they were hurt by it.”

The “N95” rapper also disclosed that without his kids there probably wouldn’t have been a Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers as we know it.

“When I got to completion and I said ‘I may or may not put this out; I’m not going to put this out; it’s way too much’ he expressed. “I thought about my children I thought about when they turn 21 or they’re older in life and when I got grandchildren or if I’m long gone—this can be a prerequisite of how to cope. That’s the beauty of it for me.”

And as history would have it Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers arrived on May 13 2022 — 5 years after his critically acclaimed album DAMN.

His latest LP featured guest appearances from Blxst Taylour Paige Summer Walker Baby Keem Ghostface Killah Kodak Black and more. Since its release the LP has amassed a billion streams on Spotify becoming the first Hip-Hop album of 2022 to do so.

We called his surprise debut the ""MCU's Greatest Introduction Ever"" and fans seemed to agree. Marvel ever in teasing mode left a breadcrumb trail toward his future in that first appearance: ""If you think I'm evil"" he tells Tom Hiddleston's Loki ""Well just wait till you meet my variants.""

In 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania audiences will finally meet the most notable of those variants: Kang himself (in the Marvel Comics there are several others most of whom are likely to show up as Marvel's ""Multiverse Saga"" continues). Majors ever committed to the role put on 10 pounds of muscle and trained like an MMA fighter and boxer to prepare.

""He is the warrior version of Kang so there was a focus on what that warrior would look like who’s been around through the ages and has developed every type of combat skill” his trainer strength-and-conditioning coach Jamie Sawyer says in a new Men's Health cover story. “It was about making him look like an imposing figure.”

Whoever had to follow Josh Brolin's Thanos as the MCU's first major multi-project villain was going to be facing an uphill battle. After Thanos was first teased in the credits of 2012's The Avengers (then played by actor and stuntman Damion Poitier) Brolin took over appearing four times between 2014 and 2019 and becoming a large looming threat over the events of every Marvel film in between.

Brolin's performances in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were heralded by fans and critics alike but Majors isn't worried about trying to stack up or compare. He says his Kang—he's signed up at the very least for Quantumania and 2025's Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and will likely also appear in Avengers: Secret Wars and possibly more—will be unlike any other villain in the MCU. “Killmonger Thanos and Kang are not related and that’s good for the MCU"" Majors says. ""It adds diversity.""

Majors isn't the first superhero star to transform his body. We've seen the likes of Kumail Nanjiani and Chris Hemsworth on the big screen in Marvel films in the last year alone looking absolutely yolked. But Majors has easily gotten more jacked than any supervillain in the franchise's history (Michael B. Jordan is probably a close second). And he knows that pushing himself to the limit is part of what audiences are expecting.

The 33-year-old star is approaching the role of Kang who first appeared in the Marvel Comics in 1964 with a level of significant respect. “I look at Kang and I go Okay cool. It’s a certain IP where people expect this at a bare minimum” he says. “No one should put themselves or their families in a place where they’re hurting but your own discomfort is not necessarily a bad thing. That’s growth. It’s not comfortable but you’re here to save the world aren’t you? Or take over the world.”

In his new role Browne will now be charged with steering the organization amid a rapidly changing landscape the CFDA added.

“I am very excited about taking on the chairmanship of the CFDA” Browne said in a statement. “I feel a huge responsibility in working with Steven and the CFDA team to carry on the positive and important work of Tom Diane and Stan. I also feel that it is important to give back to an industry that has supported me so well over the last 20 years. I am so proud to be an American designer… there is so much happening in American design today that the world needs to really see and recognize and truly appreciate.”

“Thom understands the steps that are required to build an American fashion business that is both successful and highly respected by the global fashion community” added Kolb. “Our members at every level of the CFDA and the organization as a whole will benefit immensely from his thoughts ideas and experience and I’m looking forward to our work together.”

Browne launched his business in 2003 with five gray suits in a made-to-measure shop in New York City’s West Village creating a sharply tailored uniform comprising a jacket and trouser paired with a grey cardigan a white oxford shirt a grey tie and silver tie-bar and classic black brogues. He has since expanded into complete men’s and women’s ready-to-wear collections footwear accessories and fragrance.

The designer became a member of the CFDA in 2005. He has been the recipient of CFDA’s prestigious Menswear Designer of the Year award three times: in 2006 2013 and 2016. He was also a runner-up winner of the 2005 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund.

Bamidele Onalaja CEO RevolutionPlus – Real estate is the best sector to invest your money

Bamidele Onalaja is an economist turned real estate developer is a serial entrepreneur with several years of experience in mortgage banking. The exceptional philanthropist has touched lives of widows built three tuition-free schools for the less-privileged in Lagos State. Onalaja through RevolutionPlus Property has created several employment opportunities for the teeming youths and made housing affordable for the masses of this country.

Onalaja graduated from Lagos State University with a first degree in Economics and MBA in Marketing. Then started a professional career that saw him working in several mortgage banks. Hisengagement with the mortgage banks helped him to develop passion for real estate businesses with adequate experience in the field Onalaja with his wife launched out to start Revolutionplus Property.

Speaking on the challenges of real estate business Onalaja said: “There are several challenges. If you don’t have a large heart you cannot do real estate business. The challenges are many; firstly is the “omo onile” phenomenon the ancestral land owners. I bought several acres of lands around Dangote refineries about five years ago and I had to buy it again three times. I paid to the right people carried out due diligence and had the C of O of the land and other approved documents. We paid the owners another set of people came and said they owned the title of the land. We paid them. Another set came and said they were the ancestral land owners and we must rectify from them again. We bought that land three times and learnt in a very hard way.

“The second challenge is finance. I am the Chairman of Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria Lagos chapter. The major challenge for us is finance. Building estates is huge cost; construction cost inflation and government policies make it a hard burden to bear.

“As a developer you take loans from banks you have a piece of land with Certificate of Occupancy (C of O ) but banks will not give you a loan until the title is in your company’s name. Normally changing a title to your company’s name should not take more than three months but it takes about three years or more. There is time value for money. You have moved to site the bank has seen you working on the site but cannot release money to you because the title of the land is not in your company’s name. When it takes more time to do it kills businesses. But the Government of Lagos State is really trying to make the process easy and simple. So the business of real estate is extremely challenging that is why I set up real estate school to train people. You are coming to real estate business don’t look at the money but if you are hard-working and have the favor of God you will succeed. On the other hand the challenges can frustrate one to death.”

According to Onalaja real estate is the best sector to invest money. He stressed further that records are there that return on investment in the real estate is high and all over the world.

“We have made massive contributions to the development of Nigerian economy. We have over 10000 realtors who earn their living from RevolutionPlus Properties through commissions we pay them. We have about 500 staff across six branches in Nigeria and have embarked on exciting cooperate social responsibilities. We have empowered 1000 widows by giving them money to start businesses through our foundation Chris Bamidele Onalaja foundation. We have built three free tuition and feeding schools at Ikeja Ikorodu and Makoko. The pupils get free uniforms books and food. The one at Ikeja located at Mende is in partnership with Lagos State government. During the COVID-19 lockdown we gave out palliatives to many families. We have impacted the economy of Nigeria positively as an indigenous company. I believe in Nigeria we must make this country better. As God bless us we will do more for our nation Nigeria.

“RevolutionPlus is known for its affordable housing. That is our slogan. In affordable housing you cannot target the upper class. The most populated segment of the society is the lower and the middle classes; the artisans market women and more. This class of people don’t have houses neither do they have land. These people are our target. Secondly the middle class; the fresh graduates who just got employed. This class of people RevolutionPlus Properties has solution for their housing challenges. We have developed forty two estates site and services. This is called service projects. We have developed eight estates with houses in Lagos Ibadan Shimawa Etc. The eight estates have about two hundred and thirty houses being occupied by people presently. The lower class like the market women are granted longer payment terms.

“Having done so much for the lower and the middle classes we are now reaching the upper class. We have a ten-storey high rise project at Charlie boy bus top Gbagada. We are in partnership with the Lagos State government.

“We are also reaching out to Nigerians in diaspora. RevolutionPlus has an office in Dalla USA. We have five staff working there. Many Nigerians in diaspora want to come home or have a house at home. They are looking for trusted and reliable property company to work with. RevolutionPlus has offered herself as a solution for the desires of those Nigerians. We have many of them in the UK and Saudi Arabia.

“The government should not be involved in housing development. Government should formulate policies provide basic infrastructures and allow the professionals to build. Nigeria should run a private sector- driven economy. Government has no business in building houses. That is the economy that survives. The UK USA and other European countries are private sector-driven.”

Hon. Chukwuemelie Lambert Agu: Silent Achiever Astute Administrator

Hon. Chukwuemelie Lambert Agu is a focused courageous strategic innovative and action-oriented manager of men and entities. He gives the Midas touch to whatever venture he finds himself. He is a successful businessman that pivoted to government establishment to give people shelter; man’s basic need. Until his appointment as the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of Enugu State Housing Development Corporation (ESHDC) was a successful business manager/administrator.

He was headhunted into public sector by the present Executive Governor of Enugu State Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to be the GM/CEO of ESHDC April 2016. He attended St. Patrick’s Secondary School Emene Enugu; University of Nigeria Nsukka and Enugu State University of Science & Technology.

Agu has over 20 years of choice management experiences from various positions held in a top flight businesses. He believes that the home is a sanctuary and should be treated as such:

“Whether you’re buying your first home or seeking that dream retirement residence the experience should be nothing less than seamless. As a family man myself I understands that your home is more than just a place to live — it’s where you make long-lasting memories.”

With this approach of empathy with the clients Agu’s pious leadership at Enugu State Housing Development Corporation has led to the development of many properties to the benefits of Enugu people and other clients.

On his assumption of office as the General Manager/CEO of Enugu State Housing Development Corporation he swiftly and almost simultaneously embarked on the development of more than six estates within 18 months namely: Heritage Transparency WTC Citadel I &II Rangers I &II etc. as a strategy to reduce the housing deficit in Enugu State in line with the Four Points Agenda of the Executive Governor.

As a successful and professional developer Agu focuses on the big picture. His decisiveness and firm believe that ‘time equals money’ he had demonstrated the ability to spot potentials. Therefore as a solution oriented individual Agu’s target is on delivery of quality housing for the people. Today ESHDC has fully developed the following projects:

Valley Estate 1 & 2; Citadel Estate Phase 1&2; Rangers Estate Phase 1&2; WTC Estate; Liberty Estate; Golf Estate with other ongoing projects.; Heritage Estate; Trinity Estate; Victory Estate; Sandview; Transparency; Rangers 1 & 2; Vintage; Conquest; Himaleyers; Town & Gown and Gateway with others in the offing.

As the saying goes ‘A leader is one who knows the way goes the way and shows the way’ ESHDC’s future is sure! Hon. Agu is committedly and steadily working in tandem with his boss Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi the Executive Governor of Enugu State’s vision to deliver dividends of democracy to the rural areas.

Agu’s foresightedness has led to the vision for development of estates in areas such as Nsukka Adani Ogbede among others.

He superintended the digitalisation of Enugu state Housing Development Corporation thereby making it one of the most technology driven housing development corporations in Nigeria. Hon. Agu has brought about the influential ways in which digitalization has changed the housing industry in Enugu through Building Information Modelling (BIM); a process that involves conceiving creating and planning or architecture for a real estate project using advanced data and algorithms made possible through technology.

This sort of processing allows a complete analysis of different data-driven aspects of building construction. This relies entirely on computer systems. To name a few it can help determine cost efficiency space efficiency sustainability and energy requirements. This digitized advancement means better planning and execution or real estate ventures.

Agu is truly a tech-savvy builder! He introduced and saw to the implementation of Land Bank System (LBS) in ESHDC. With land banking ESHDC embarked on the aggregation of parcels of land for future sale or development. While in many countries land banking may refer to various private real estate investment schemes ESDHC’s practices a quasi-governmental county or municipal authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land. This is making gainful use of the scare resource – land!

Agu plugged ESHDC into partnership with private real estate companies commercial banks Mortgage institutions the Federal Mortgage Bank to blend with Government’s effort towards affordable housing for the people of Enugu State and environs.

Even as a silent achiever many organisations would find their way to present awards to the soft-spoken ever-busy and astute administrator. Today Hon. Chukwuemelie Lambert Agu is a recipient of many awards including the “Best MD of Housing Corporations in Nigeria 2021”; the prestigious “CEO of Housing Corporation 2019”."

In a phase 3 trial that enrolled kids ages 1 to 11 68% on a higher dose and 58% of children on a lower dose of Dupixent achieved significant histological disease remission. That compared with just 3% in the placebo group.

With the results Dupixent becomes the first drug to show positive results in the age group Sanofi said. The drugmaker and its partner Regeneron plan to submit the data to regulatory authorities “across the world” starting with FDA submission in 2023.

If approved Dupixent would be the first treatment for EoE patients under 12.

The trial featured a pediatric EoE sign and symptom questionnaire for caregivers which the companies said was a “novel endpoint” designed to assess symptoms in young children who might have difficulty verbalizing symptoms on their own.

Investigators shared data from the ongoing trial on Tuesday at the United European Gastroenterology Week.

Approximately 21000 children in the U.S. in the age group are being treated for EoE the companies said. About 9000 of them don’t respond to their current treatment regimen.

The disease is harsh in children and can impact growth weight gain and development. It can also lead to food-related anxiety that can persist throughout adulthood. Diet adjustments such as eliminating many foods is the standard treatment for EoE in children.

Meanwhile Dupixent is on its way to biopharma superstardom. Sanofi executives recently raised their sales projection to 13 billion euros thanks to strong expected uptake across a range of diseases.

Dupixent just bagged the first U.S. approval for prurigo nodularis and is being studied in other diseases including chronic spontaneous urticaria hand and foot dermatitis and choric pruritis of unknown origin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGhhcm1hcGhvcnVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ltbXV0ZXBzLWxhZy0zLWRydWctZHJhbWF0aWNhbGx5LXVuZGVydmFsdWVkLXNheXMtYW5hbHlzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Immutep's LAG-3 drug 'dramatically undervalued' says analyst,"Australian biotech Immutep's LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitor eftilagimod alpha (efti) may not be the first drug in the class to reach the market but is a strong contender and according to at least one analyst is on course for multibillion-dollar peak sales.

Immutep claimed fast-track status from the FDA for efti last week as a combination therapy alongside Merck & Co's PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for previously-untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the results of the phase 2 TACTI-002 study.

The study showed that the combination has the potential to ""provide a safer and better tolerated alternative"" to the use of PD-1/PD-L1 drugs plus chemotherapy in first-line NSCLC the current standard of treatment according to Dr Chris Redhead of Goetz Partners.

Keytruda plus efti delivered a 42% overall response rate (ORR) and 9.3-month median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to a 50% ORR and 7.2 month mPFS with Keytruda plus chemo with fewer side effects.

The regimen offers ""substantially expanding treatment responsive populations and decreasing toxicity-linked treatment discontinuation"" he writes in a research note adding that the fast-track status could speed up approval and is a ""welcome lift"" as Immutep plans a phase 3 trial of efti plus Keytruda in NSCLC.

Redhead reckons NSCLC is a $6 billion opportunity on its own for efti – given $17 billion-a-year Keytruda makes a large proportion of its revenues from NSCLC – with follow-up indications like head and neck and breast cancer pushing peak sales potential up to $8 billion.

Also in its favour is that LAG-3 is now a tried and tested target. Bristol-Myers Squibb claimed the first approval for a LAG-3 drug in March – getting a green light from the FDA for its relatlimab antibody in combination with its PD-1 drug nivolumab under the Opdualag brand name.

That approval was in melanoma a much smaller patient population than NSCLC although BMS is already testing Opdualag in NSCLC and other indications including colorectal cancer and has predicted it could make annual sales of $4 billion by the end of the decade.

A key readout for BMS will be a front-line phase 2 study of its combination in NSCLC due to read out in 2024 but its unclear if that could support approval so Immutep could be able to maintain a lead in this type of cancer.

Meanwhile other drugmakers looking at LAG-3 drugs include Novartis – which is working with Immutep on a candidate called leramilimab – as well as Incyte and Regeneron.

Immutep has been building momentum behind efti with a constant flow of positive data including a phase 2b trial data in head and neck and breast cancer which showed improvements in overall survival according to Redhead. It also has fast-track status as a combination with Keytruda in first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Noting that Immutep's share price has been hit by market turbulence and ""flight from risk"" he reckons efti is ""dramatically undervalued"" and will look more attractive as patents on the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor class start to expire in the coming years.

Amid the highly uncertain global environment risks to financial stability have increased substantially.

Major issues facing financial systems include inflation at multi-decade highs continuing deterioration of the economic outlooks in many regions and persistent geopolitical risks as we discuss in our latest GlobalFinancial Stability Report.

To avoid inflationary pressures from becoming entrenched central banks confronting stubbornly high inflation have had to accelerate monetary policy tightening. What’s more those in advanced and emerging economies alike also face magnified risks and vulnerabilities across different sectors and regions.

Financial vulnerabilities are elevated for governments many with mounting debt as well as nonbank financial institutions such as insurers pension funds hedge funds and mutual funds. Rising rates have added to stresses for entities with stretched balance sheets.

At the same time the ease and speed with which assets can be traded at a given price has deteriorated across some key asset classes due to volatile interest rates and asset prices. This poor market liquidity together with pre-existing vulnerabilities could amplify any rapid disorderly repricing of risk were it to occur in the coming months.

Global markets are showing strains as investors have recently become more risk-averse amid heightened economic and policy uncertainty. Financial asset prices have fallen as monetary policy has tightened the economic outlook has deteriorated recession fears have grown borrowing in hard currency has become more expensive and stress in some nonbank financial institutions has accelerated. Bond yields are rising broadly across credit ratings with borrowing costs for many countries and companies already rising to the highest levels in a decade or more.

Property concerns

The faltering property sector in many countries raises concerns about risks that could broaden and spill over into banks and the macroeconomy. Risks to housing markets are growing because of rising mortgage rates and tightening lending standards with many more potential borrowers now being squeezed out of markets. Stretched housing valuations could adjust sharply in some market segments.

Emerging markets are confronting a multitude of risks including high external borrowing costs stubbornly high inflation and volatile commodity markets. They also face heightened uncertainty about the global economy and policy tightening in advanced economies.

Strains are particularly severe in frontier markets —generally smaller developing economies—where challenges are driven by a combination of tightening financial conditions deteriorating fundamentals and high exposure to commodity price volatility.

Investors have so far continued to differentiate across emerging economies. While many frontier markets are at risk of sovereign default many of the largest emerging markets are more resilient to external vulnerabilities to date. Having said that after the stabilization of outflows in the first half of the year foreign investors are again pulling back.

Emerging and frontier market bond issuance in US dollars and other major currencies has slowed to the weakest pace since 2015. Without improved access to foreign funding many frontier market issuers will have to seek alternative sources and/or debt reprofiling and restructurings.

The global banking sector has been bolstered by high levels of capital and ample liquidity buffers. However the IMF’s Global Bank Stress Test warns these buffers may not be enough for some banks. In the event a sharp tightening of financial conditions causes a global recession next year amid high inflation 29 percent of emerging-market banks (by assets) would breach capital requirements. Most banks in advanced economies would fare much better the stress test indicates.

The challenging macroeconomic environment is also putting pressure on the global corporate sector. Credit spreads have widened substantially and high costs are eroding corporate profits. For small firms bankruptcies have already started to increase because of higher borrowing costs and diminished fiscal support.

Policy recommendations

Central banks must act resolutely to bring inflation back to target and avoid a de-anchoring of inflation expectations which would damage their credibility. Clear communication about policy decisions commitment to price stability and the need for further tightening will be crucial to preserve credibility and avoid market volatility.

Exchange rate flexibility helps countries adjust to the differential pace of monetary policy tightening across countries. In cases where exchange rate movements impede the central bank’s monetary transmission mechanism and/or generate broader financial stability risks foreign exchange intervention can be deployed. Such interventions should be part of an integrated approach to addressing vulnerabilities as laid out in the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework .

Emerging and frontier markets should reduce debt risk through early engagement with creditors multilateral cooperation and international support. For those in distress bilateral and private sector creditors should coordinate on preemptive restructuring to avoid costly defaults and prolonged loss of market access. Where applicable the Group of Twenty Common Framework should be used.

Policymakers face an unusually challenging financial stability environment. Though no globally systemic event has materialized so far they should contain further buildup of vulnerabilities by adjusting selected macroprudential tools to tackle any pockets of risk. In this highly uncertain environment striking a balance between containing these potential threats and avoiding a disorderly tightening of financial conditions will be critical.

With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9% ESG assets are on pace to constitute 21.5% of total global AuM in less than 5 years. It represents a dramatic and continuing shift in the asset and wealth management (AWM) industry according to PwC’s Asset and Wealth Management Revolution 2022 report. The report also captures the views of 250 institutional investors and asset managers worldwide representing nearly half of global AuM.

ESG-oriented AuM is set to grow at a much faster pace than the AWM market as a whole. Under PwC’s base-case growth scenario ESG-oriented AUM in the US (the largest AWM market) would more than double from US$4.5tn in 2021 to US$10.5 tn in 2026; in Europe (already up 172% in 2021 alone) it would increase 53% to US$19.6tn. Investors in other regions outside the USA and Europe are also growing their allocations. Asia-Pacific (APAC) has the fastest percentage growth in ESG AuM with this expected to more than triple reaching $3.3tn in 2026. ESG products in Africa and the Middle East are gaining market share as well as in Latin America where ESG products account for $25bn in AuM.

ESG investing found to yield higher returns

Belying questions of whether financial and ESG performance might conflict nine of ten asset managers surveyed believe that integrating ESG into their investment strategy will improve overall returns. What’s more a majority of institutional investors 60% reported that ESG investing has already resulted in higher performance yields compared to non-ESG equivalents.

With the prospect of higher returns investors surveyed are willing to pay for ESG performance – three-quarters 78% say they would pay higher fees for ESG funds. Half of investors 52% are willing to build ESG into performance-related fees – two-thirds of those would accept a 3-5% ESG premium. More than half 57% of asset managers are looking at charging ESG-based performance fees with most of these 60% saying a range of 3-5% would be acceptable.

For asset managers higher fees are needed in some instances to make up for increasing ESG compliance costs – 35% of asset managers surveyed noted these costs have increased 10-20%.

While tensions are frequently highlighted between ESG priorities and asset managers’ fiduciary duty to maximize financial returns for investors three-quarters of investors now consider ESG to be part of their fiduciary duties. Nearly as many 72% say they set ESG-related goals for their asset managers at a portfolio level however the extent to which this overrides financial return varies.

Olwyn Alexander PwC Global Asset & Wealth Management Leader PwC Ireland said: “ESG has become perhaps the most powerful driver of growth in asset and wealth management. The surge in demand for ESG investments highlighted in our survey exceeds almost all previous expectations. With the current economic headwinds we have seen some correction in asset prices and there is a risk of significant contraction in capital markets that would result in a further decline. This underlines the importance for asset managers and institutional investors alike to understand how to capture the shift to ESG as a counter-balance to potential portfolio underperformance as well as legacy product obsolescence.”

Demand for ESG investment products is outstripping supply

As the demand for ESG investment products rapidly increases 30% of investors say that they struggle to find attractive and adequate ESG investment opportunities. Nearly nine in ten 88% of institutional investors surveyed believe asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products. However less than half 45% of managers said they are planning to launch new ESG funds. Instead a majority of asset managers surveyed 76% said their immediate priority is converting existing products so they can be labeled as ESG-oriented.

Complex and inconsistent regulation is a stumbling block to an increased ESG focus as is the need for more trusted transparent data on ESG products. A lack of consistent transparent standards has made mislabeling products as “ESG” a widespread issue. Nearly three quarters 71% of institutional investors surveyed and over eight in ten asset managers said that mislabeling is prevalent within the AWM industry.

For 71% of institutional investors at least part of the solution would be strengthening ESG regulatory requirements for asset managers. A majority 56% of institutional investors and 76% of asset managers said they support strengthening ESG disclosure rules for listed companies.

More than a third of investors 38% believe a lack of data from asset managers is a challenge in investing in or considering ESG products while 64% of asset managers believe data challenges are a main obstacle when adopting or considering ESG investments.

Ends.

About the PwC Asset and Wealth Management Revolution 2022

PwC’s Asset and Wealth Management Survey is a global survey of asset managers and institutional investors. The goal of the survey is to better understand how the current AWM industry views changes related to ESG and the direction in which that change is likely to take the industry in the future coming years.

The asset manager survey sample included 250 respondents accounting for a total global AuM of approximately US$50 trillion. The respondent base was largely cross-sectional in terms of size and tranche.

The institutional investors survey consisted of 250 respondents with combined global assets of US$60 trillion. Respondents covered a broad spectrum of AuM size with more than half boasting assets of more than US$10 billion. Public pension funds and private pension funds together accounted for more than half of the institutional investor respondent base.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nbG9iYWwtY2VtZW50LW1hcmtldC1hbmFseXNpcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLTEwNTAwMDE2NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Cement Market: Analysis By Production By Consumption Type By Application By Region Size and Trends ...,"ReportLinker

The global cement market was valued at US$328. 73 billion in 2021 and is expected to be worth US$443. 06 billion in 2027. Cement is a substance which binds together other materials by a combination of chemical processes collectively known as setting.

New York Oct. 10 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Global Cement Market: Analysis By Production By Consumption Type By Application By Region Size and Trends with Impact of COVID-19 and Forecast up to 2027"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06323445/?utm_source=GNW

Cement is a dry powder and should not be confused with concretes or mortars but it is an important constituent of both of these materials in which it acts as the ’glue’ that gives strength to structures. Mortar is a mixture of cement and sand whereas concrete also includes rough aggregates. Because it is a major component of both of these building materials cement is an extremely important construction material.



The global cement production in 2021 was recorded at 4.37 billion ton whereas the consumption was 4.27 billion ton. Cement is used in the production of the many structures that make up the modern world including buildings bridges harbors runways and roads. It is also used for facades and other decorative features on buildings. The constant demand for all of these structures increasingly from the developing world means that cement is the second most consumed commodity in the world after water. The global cement market is determined to grow at a CAGR of 5.10% over the forecasted period of 2022-2027.



Market Segmentation Analysis:



By Type: The report identifies three segments on the basis of type: Blended Portland and Ohers. The blended segment held the largest market share (more than 55%) in 2021 due to features such as reduced water demand improved workability and pump ability and reduced crack formation due to thermal stress. The blended segment consists of base portland in which other materials such as limestone slag and pozzolana are added to obtain the different blends. The demand for blended types from industries like mining building construction and road construction is expected to increase which would boost the market for the blended segment in coming years.



By Application: The report identifies two segments on the basis of application: Non Residential and Residential. The non-residential segment is expected to be the most dominant segment throughout the forecast period. This market segment uses the cement products for tasks like building stadiums commercial complexes industrial buildings roads dams and transportation hubs. The demand for the product has increased as a result of growing urbanisation and infrastructure development. Additionally the market is anticipated to grow due to the high demand for hospitals and schools.



By Region: In the report the global cement market by production is divided into four regions: Asia Pacific Europe The US and ROW. Asia Pacific accounted for the maximum share of more than 70% of the global production in 2021. Four of the top ten cement producers in the world are from Asia: China Vietnam India and Indonesia. In contrast to China where most of the locally produced cement is consumed Vietnam exports a large portion of its cement with the construction industry receiving the majority of the supply.



The global cement market by consumption is divided into five regions : Asia Pacific Middle East & Africa Europe North America and Latin America. Asia Pacific held the major share of around 74% of the global cement consumption in 2021. Rapid urbanization growing construction activities and government infrastructure programs have all supported the growth of the market over the past years. The announcement of significant construction projects in the Asia-Pacific region has given rise to optimism about a steady increase in cement demand in the near future.



Significant growth is predicted for the Middle East and Africa region. This growth is attributed to the product’s rising demand as a result of the region’s expanding infrastructure-related activities. Another factor influencing the Middle East & Africa market is its use in mining and oil exploration activities.



Market Dynamics:



Growth Drivers: One of the key drivers of the market’s expansion is the surging demand from construction activities. A significant increase in construction activities due to widespread industrialization is driving the global cement market growth. Both residential and commercial construction activities are rising globally owing to expanding urbanization along with the development of mega infrastructure projects especially in emerging economies. This is leading to increasing consumption of cement and is creating a huge market demand across the world. Other significant growth factors of the market include increasing adoption of green cement rapid urbanization rising disposable incomes and utilization of circulating resources.



Challenges: However some challenges are impeding the growth of the market such as rising government regulations on carbon emissions from manufacturing plants depleting fossil fuel reserves and higher power consumption. Cement is an essential construction material but its production process generates significant CO2 emissions. Two-thirds of these emissions are generated by the chemical transformation of the raw materials (process emissions) while the remaining third is linked to the energy used during the manufacturing process (combustion emissions). The cement industry generates 6-7% of the CO2 emitted globally. As cement is a meaningful contributor to global CO2 emissions governments of various countries are imposing various environmental regulations over the production process to control the CO2 emissions from manufacturing plants. Hence this is anticipated to restrain the market growth.



Trends: The market is projected to grow at a fast pace during the forecast period due to growing civil engineering sector technological advancements in the production process and surging infrastructure projects in developing regions. The construction sector in developing regions is expanding rapidly. A well established infrastructure sector represents the country’s economy and needs to match with rising pace of economic growth. The number of new infrastructure projects are increasing with the growing economy of various developing countries such as India. Government bodies are taking initiatives to improve the status of their countries by improving the infrastructure sector. The increasing number infrastructure projects is thus propelling the demand for cement and other related products contributing to the growth of the global cement market.



Impact Analysis of COVID-19 and Way Forward:



The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the temporary shutdown of production plants in several countries as well as the closure of construction sites. Several countries including Italy the US and India have witnessed curfew-like situations where businesses (except essential services) were not allowed to operate. As a consequence of halted construction activities economic constraints unavailability of raw materials and man power the demand for cement declined. Thus the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global cement market.



However the market regained the momentum as economic activities resumed and manufacturing activities started across the world. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly impacted volumes of heavy building materials last year but only to a relatively modest extent due to the fact that governments quickly recognized the essential nature of the industry and permitted a rapid reopening of construction sites and their various suppliers.



Competitive Landscape:



The global cement market is moderately concentrated. The product is produced primarily in various parts of the world which has resulted in a more diverse market structure. In order to strengthen the market positions and propel the business growth players with headquarters in North America and Europe are aiming to expand their presence in China and other countries in the Asia Pacific region. The market’s major players have established robust regional presences distribution networks and product portfolios.



The key players in the global cement market are:



UltraTech Cement Ltd.

China National Building Material Company

Cemex SAB de CV

HeidelbergCement AG

Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd

Holcim Ltd.

China Resources Cement Holdings Limited

Taiwan Cement Corporation

China Shanshui Cement Group

Huaxin Cement Co. Ltd.

Votorantim Cementos

Tangshan Jidong Cement Co.Ltd



Key players are expected to increase their market presence and effectively meet the needs of their customers as a result of the strategies they have adopted such as acquisition the development of new products and initiatives involving zero-carbon construction materials. For example HeidelbergCement intends to produce CO2-neutral concrete by 2050. In June 2022 Ultratech Cement Ltd. declared that the company’s board had approved to increase cement production capacity by 22.6 million tonnes annually by 2025. Holcim signed a contract in May 2022 allowing the Adani Group to buy the company’s operations in India. The acquisition would include Holcim’s 63.11% ownership of Ambuja Cement and 4.48% direct ownership of ACC. Heidelberg Cement in June 2021 announced plans to convert the company’s Slite factory in Sweden into the first carbon-neutral cement plant by 2030.

RSG,Republic Services,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRlbmVyZ3kuY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZXMvd2h5LXJlcHVibGljLXNlcnZpY2VzLWtpbmRlci1tb3JnYW4tYXJlLWJ1bGxpc2gtcm5nLTIwMjQzM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Republic Services Kinder Morgan Are Bullish on RNG,"HOUSTON—Companies looking to capitalize on sustainability are finding opportunities in waste as methane captured at landfills and farms is transformed into renewable natural gas (RNG).

The pipeline quality gas which can be used in the same ways as natural gas is attracting attention from energy infrastructure companies like Kinder Morgan Inc. as well as environmental services companies such as Republic Services. Executives from both companies recently shared why they are bullish on this biogas during Hart Energy’s America’s Natural Gas Conference.

Republic Services sees RNG as a growth engine.

“By making investments in this RNG space we’re demonstrating our belief that economic sustainability and environmental sustainability go hand in hand. We view at Republic sustainability as a growth platform” said Tim Oudman vice president of business development for Republic Services. “As part of that our actions and our investments not only help achieve our sustainability goals but they help our customers and communities achieve theirs as well.”

“Between rising commodity costs and obviously increased demand from customers for RNG... That’s certainly driving investor and stakeholder interest in this in this space.”—Tim Oudman Republic Services

RNG has been gaining attention as companies look for ways to lower emissions using existing infrastructure doing their parts to slow global warming. The environmental benefits of the biogas which can leverage existing infrastructure and be used in place of diesel or gasoline include significantly reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Companies including Amazon UPS and Republic are using RNG to run their fleets.

Given RNG projects capture and recover methane a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas (GHG) that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere its ability to help lower GHG emissions is also seen as a positive.

New RNG Approach

Republic Services which aims to increase biogas sent to beneficial reuse by 50% from 2017 levels by 2030 has about 70 landfill gas projects—some RNG facilities and some medium BTU projects in which gas is piped to an industrial user. The solid waste collection company isn’t new to developing RNG.

“What is new is the approach we’re taking” Oudman said.

Republic Services has moved from one-off developments as it builds an entire portfolio. Its $1.1 billion joint venture—called Lightning Renewables LLC—with RNG producer Archaea Energy will bring in about 40 sites to help commercialize methane at scale generating more than 12.5 MMBtu of RNG.

The companies announced Oct. 4 plans for the Middle Point Landfill gas-to-RNG project in Tennessee.

Significant benefits come with the JV approach according to Oudman.

“We get procurement benefits. You get economies of scale. We’re also benefiting from standardization of operations” he said. “That’ll certainly help keep costs down and optimize offtake strategy. You take all those things together it makes a pretty good recipe for success versus this kind of traditional one-off approach that we’ve had previously.”

Republic Services expects to fully build out the projects by 2027 reusing 70% of the landfill gas generated in its portfolio annually.

“Between rising commodity costs and obviously increased demand from customers for RNG—there’s climate action plans out—there is a lot of regulatory support” Oudman added. “That’s certainly driving investor and stakeholder interest in this in this space. More and more companies are committing finite investment dollars to increase RNG production.”

RNG’s Allure

For Kinder Morgan RNG’s allure is based on the total available market offtake and what Thomas Holcombe the company’s director of business development called “energy realities.”

The company acquired in 2021 RNG developer Kinetrex Energy.

“When we think about the size of the market the RNG market as a whole has experienced pretty meaningful growth in the last couple of years” Holcombe said. “We currently have 350 facilities that are either in operation or under construction today within North America across all the various feeds. So that’s landfill wastewater and dairy as well.”

At less than 200000 MMBtu per day RNG production is not as great as natural gas according to Holcombe but it could climb to between 2 Bcf/d and 4 Bcf/d by 2050.

“When we think about the size of the market the RNG market as a whole has experienced pretty meaningful growth in the last couple of years”—Thomas Holcombe Kinder Morgan

“That ability for us to be able to capture this value now and participate in this growth continue to capture and attract more market share is very very attractive to us” he said before turning to offtake and increasing regulatory pressure that in turn is driving demand for RNG.

RNG is seen as a way to lower carbon intensity without spending more capital on infrastructure.

“They can utilize the equipment they have in place. Yes it does cost more than geologic but it does allow to pass on that lower carbon intensity score to the customers” he said.

On energy realities Holcomb added as more renewables try to penetrate the grid it will cause more intermittency increasing demand for dispatchable power.

Citing 2021 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration he said “we consume right at 70 quadrillion Btu; 80% of that is fossil fuels.” Industrial consumption was 25 quadrillion Btu of which 12% came from electricity.

“We cannot electrify everything. ... Without massive transformative technological changes it can’t happen” Holcombe said. “So when you think about the future of energy renewable fuels specifically [RNG] that can actually leverage infrastructure in place are very important. … We do believe it is a solution that is attainable it’s affordable and is actionable today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb3R0c2RhbGVhei5nb3Yvc29saWQtd2FzdGUvcmVjeWNsaW5nLWFsbGV5LXJlZnJlc2gtY2FtcGFpZ27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Town Alley Refresh Campaign,"Program Overview

The Scottsdale City Council recently initiated the Old Town Scottsdale Recycling and Alley Refresh Campaign. The goal of the program is to provide recycling options beautify the alleys and increase sustainability.

There are two major components to the program The Alley Refresh Program and a Pilot Recycling Program. A questionnaire is available for all downtown business owners and residents to help determine interest in participating in the recycling program what roadblocks currently exist to recycling and what factors would make the program most successful.

Take the Old Town Recycling Questionnaire

Alley Refresh Program

Four Alleys in the Old Town Area were identified to participate in the Alley Refresh Program. Scottsdale Code Enforcement and Solid Waste Teams worked in tandem with business and property owners to take steps to clean and improve Old Town Alleys with the goal of keeping them clean and welcoming.

The team worked in alleys on a rotating schedule to assess needs and make improvements. Members of the city's code enforcement team performed inspections to assess the state of the alleyways and met with business owners to make improvements. Solid Waste Services cleaned around trash enclosures and painted or replaced trash bins as needed. All businesses along the alley were invited to participate in a one-time free business bulk trash pickup at the end of the clean up period.

The alley refresh will also addressed the following concerns:

Outside storage of materials equipment and business-related items

Encroachment into sidewalks and walking paths

Graffiti

Litter trash shopping carts and debris

Blight and deteriorated surfaces of buildings

Grass and weeds

Clean cared for alleys not only improve the aesthetics of downtown but also deter crime and improve the health of the community all of which is good for business.

As a final step in the program alleys were repaved in mid-January. The new surface will enhance curb appeal for businesses and provide a smoother and safer driving experience for employees and customers. Utility adjustments will take place in the newly paved alleys in March. The adjustments should take one day to complete and the alleys will remain open.

Pilot Recycling Program

The city has recently identified two alleys to use as a pilot for the program. One alley has 100 percent city accounts trash and recycling accounts and the other has public and private service providers. Council members and city staff will soon begin reaching out to businesses and property owners in those alleys.

The recycling program may look different in each alley based on the service providers that pick-up trash and recycling. The city has had initial discussions with Waste Management and Republic Services who have both indicated they are interested in participating in the program.

How You Can Help Now

Did you know?

Moving your recyclables out of the trash and into a recycling bin has the potential to reduce your solid waste bill. Breaking down cardboard and recycling it makes more space in your trash containers resulting in less clutter in the alleys. All garbage belongs in the trash bin not in the alleyways. Trash not placed in a container attracts animals and makes alleyways unsanitary.

We Want to Hear from You

Please take the time to fill out the recycling questionnaire to help determine what factors would make the program most successful.

This program will only work with your participation. If you have ideas about how to make recycling in Old Town alley successful or would like to be involved in the program please send us an email and let us know.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2hhbm5lbDUuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2NoYW5uZWwtNS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMvbWlkZGxlLXBvaW50LWxhbmRmaWxsLWNhbGxzLWxhd3N1aXQtZnJpdm9sb3VzLWFuZC1iYXNlbGVzcy1hcy10aGV5LWZpbGUtbW90aW9ucy10by1kaXNtaXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Middle Point Landfill: Lawsuit is 'frivolous' and 'baseless',"MURFREESBORO Tenn. (WTVF) — Republic Services filed two motions to dismiss the lawsuit they call “frivolous” filed against them by the city of Murfreesboro back in August.

The lawsuit against the operators of Middle Point Landfill alleged they were responsible for toxic chemicals leaking into the East Fork Stones River and the Walter Hill Recreation Area.

Murfreesboro city attorneys said the landfill accepted all types of waste for years ranging from industrial and paint sludges soils with low radiation metal shavings and soil contaminated with diesel waste.

They say the material has seeped into local waterways and produced a foul odor resulting in more than 2000 complaints since the city first opened its complaint portal last year.

The city is seeking an injunction against the defendants where they would be required to halt operations until they can fix the smell and discharge into the river.

Middle Point says they denounce “the frivolous and baseless claims” made against them.

“BFI condemns Plaintiff’s blatant disregard for the use of judicial resources and the legal process by bringing forth a legal claim displaying a clear lack of legal precedent facts or merit in a cheap ploy to generate media attention and scapegoat the Defendants.”

Middle Point goes on to say they deny each allegation made by the City of Murfreesboro but they also suggest others could be to blame for any groundwater runoff.

Their first motion to dismiss names Rutherford County as an “indispensable party” because their landfill operates adjacent to Middle Point Landfill.

They suggest that it’s “more than likely based on proximity and direction of the groundwater flow that the Rutherford County Landfill is the functional source of any alleged discharge to the East Fork Stones River.”

""The City has made baseless allegations about a so-called “spring discharge” of contaminants into the East Fork Stones River. However the location of this discharge is upgradient of the Middle Point Landfill. Groundwater flow at the Middle Point Landfill is not toward this discharge. The more likely source of this discharge is the adjacent Rutherford County Landfill which is directly next to the alleged contamination and has historically failed to sufficiently collect leachate from their unlined landfill.""

Middle Point officials say the county has for decades discharged their leachate material free of charge into the Middle Point Landfill on-site treatment plant. They say by forcing Middle Point to stop discharging leachate they are in effect telling the county to do the same.

If a judge agrees to the motions the City of Murfreesboro would be in the position of suing Rutherford County in the same lawsuit.

In a statement from Middle Point they say they've invested $7.5 million in their gas collection and control system ""including the installation of 84 new gas wells and nearly 4000 linear feet of horizontal collectors. Additionally the site invested $2.5M into the onsite pre-treatment plant to treat leachate from the Middle Point and Rutherford County landfills.""

Mike Classen General Manager for Post Collection Operations said “We are doing everything in our power to continue responsible site management. We are proud of the improvements we’ve made here at Middle Point Landfill and look forward to continuing to invest in our community.”

Before the lawsuit NewsChannel5 Investigates obtained an exclusive video that showed how gases escaped the landfill. Some said those same gases only made the odor worse. The footage showed flare stacks meant to burn off harmful gas that some said was hardly doing the job.

In total the landfill expanded to 207 acres of fill space located inside a total 803-acre parcel with support facilities according to the lawsuit. Earlier in 2021 the expansion of the landfill was voted down after pushback from neighbors and city leaders. In 2022 Rutherford County officials proposed no longer accepting any kind of waste to the landfill.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8va2p6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9nYXJiYWdlLXRydWNrLWNyYXNoZXMtc3BhbmlzaC1mb3JrLWhvdXNlLW5laWdoYm9yaG9vZC11dGFoLWNvdW50eS1wb3NzaWJsZS1maXJlLW5lYXJiedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garbage truck crashes into Spanish Fork house; driver transported,"Law enforcement in Spanish Fork responded to a neighborhood Tuesday where a garbage truck crashed into a house.

The crash happened in the area of 200 East and 300 North just after 7:30 a.m.

The driver of the truck suffered an apparent medical incident police said which may have lead to the crash. An investigation is underway. When authorities arrived the driver was unconscious in the cab of the truck which had driven through the garage and into the wall separating the exterior from the interior.

Images shared by the department show the hopper of a Republic Services truck -- the company the city uses for trash collection -- protruding from the garage area of the corner home where it had crashed into the corner area after apparently driving over and dragging a chain-link fence.

The crash caused structural damage according to a media statement from SFPD Lt. Crory Slaymaker and responding officers apparently had to go into the house to access the cab and extricate the driver.

The man who police said is in his 50s was transported to the hospital.

RELATED REPORTS













Three adults were inside the home at the time of the crash police said. None of them were injured.



Slaymaker told 2News that the Spanish Fork Fire Department assisted in ventilating a large amount of dust generated inside the house by the crash. The dust was apparently mistaken for smoke and dispatchers fielded at least one call of a fire in the neighborhood.

He said there was not a fire at any time during the incident.

It wasn't clear if there was anyone else in the truck at the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndicmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTIvY2hhbmdlcy1nYXJiYWdlLXBpY2t1cC1zaGVsYnktY291bnR5LWNhdXNlcy1kZWxheXMv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2JyYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8xMi9jaGFuZ2VzLWdhcmJhZ2UtcGlja3VwLXNoZWxieS1jb3VudHktY2F1c2VzLWRlbGF5cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Changes to garbage pickup in Shelby County causes delays,"SHELBY CO. Ala. (WBRC) - Some Shelby County neighbors say they haven’t had their garbage picked up in the last two weeks.

Effective at the beginning of this month the garbage collection service provider changed from Republic Services to Waste Management.

Waste Management said they are sending extra personnel to help during this transition.

Shelby County facility manager Trey Gauntt said some of their drivers were new to the routes and new to the area.

“It has taken them a little while we are a little over a week in now into their contract so it has taken them a bit to learn the route and get familiar with those routes” Gauntt said.

Residents from Columbiana Vincent Highway 49 and Highway 61 are currently without garbage pickup.

Those homeowners told me they received a card notifying them of the change in garbage pickup services however as of today they have not seen a truck.

“We just ask the customers to please be patient with our contractor and allow them to some time to get through this learning curve” Gauntt said.

Gauntt said Waste Management is working to get all caught up by next week.

Keep in mind that recycling services have also been discontinued.

While talks have been ongoing for some time an agreement isn’t likely for a few weeks and the deal still may fall through according to the report.

Spokespersons at both companies weren’t immediately available to comment when contacted by MedTech Dive.

Hercules Calif.-based Bio-Rad makes various products for the life science research and clinical diagnostic markets. It has a market capitalization of just under $12 billion. Qiagen is a Germany-based diagnostics company with a market capitalization of about $10 billion.

Thermo Fisher attempted to buy Qiagen in 2020 in a deal that was initially valued at $11.5 billion. That transaction fell apart after failing to secure support from Qiagen’s shareholders. Thermo Fisher went on to acquire research contractor PPD last year for $17.4 billion.

The report of a Bio-Rad tie up with Qiagen comes amid a lull of medtech mergers and acquisitions following a spending spree last year. Notable acquisitions this year include Stryker’s $3 billion purchase of Vocera Communications ResMed’s approximately $1 billion pickup of MediFox Dan and Becton Dickinson’s $1.53 billion purchase of Parata Systems.

(Part 2 Randstad),"Next up in our preview of accounting salaries for 2023 is the latest Finance & Accounting Salary Guide from staffing agency Randstad. Randstad Robert Half and Accounting Principals are probably the “big 3” when it comes to publishing accounting and finance salary prognostications for the coming year. We wrapped up analyzing Robert Half’s 2023 Accounting & Finance Salary Guide last week and we’ll take a look at the new one from Accounting Principals later this week.

Randstad has 2023 salary projections for 23 roles under the Accounting category 13 under Banking eight under Executive eight under Finance four under Internal Audit two under Procurement/Purchasing three under Tax and three under Treasury. For this post we’re highlighting projected 2023 salaries for four accounting jobs and three tax jobs and comparing them to what Randstad thought the salaries for those seven roles would be in 2022 to see if pay is expected to go up or down next year.

Pay data is presented under three ranges—low mid and high (last year it was entry-level mid-level and senior-level)—to accommodate employees’ varying experience expertise time in a specific role and market demand according to Randstad.

Randstad’s PR machine put out a press release promoting the salary guide with the headline of “Salaries in Finance & Accounting on the Rise.” Are they tho? For almost all of the seven jobs we highlighted below yes salaries are expected to increase next year. The only holdouts are for junior accountant (all three pay ranges are projected to be lower in 2023 than 2022) and staff accountant (2023 projections are lower in the “mid” and “high” pay ranges than in 2022).

Note: Robert Half’s salary guide predicts starting salaries in accounting and finance for 2023; Randstad projects non-starting pay ranges for employees in those roles. Another difference between the two guides: Bob includes pay data for eight roles specifically for public accounting (four in audit and four in tax). Randstad doesn’t have a Public Accounting category so we had to pick and choose the seven roles we wanted to spotlight in this post. The 2023 salary data for these seven jobs might be helpful to those of you working in PA now who are planning to make the jump to industry next year or for accounting students who are curious about the salary expectations for these roles.

A quarter (25 per cent) of businesses say they cannot continue to raise pay because of instability new research has revealed.

The data analysis from Robert Half found that the majority (70 per cent) of employers recognised their employees were struggling to manage increasing costs and could seek higher wages elsewhere but only a quarter (26 per cent) could commit to permanently raising pay.

Additionally a quarter (25 per cent) also believed poor pay and heavy workloads would affect their ability to retain valued employees.

Two-thirds of businesses seeing more requests for pay rises research finds

Employers urged to prioritise fair pay as real living wage increases

Four-day week could help alleviate cost of living crisis think tank says

Vickie Graham business development director at the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals (CIPP) said it was only natural for employees to look at their take-home pay when the economy bites but that it was not always “feasible” for businesses to increase wages. ""The CIPP recommends that employers look to other incentives to attract and retain talent” said Graham adding that flexible working was currently “among the most valued benefits offered especially if it provides employees the ability to work around childcare arrangements and/or second jobs to help boost income”.

The data also highlighted that a third (33 per cent) of firms were currently extending remote working opportunities to help reduce travel costs. This correlates with recent CIPD research which found that almost a third (30 per cent) of businesses that had recruited in the last 12 months found flexible working was the most effective way to attract candidates.

Nicola Kleinmann HR and talent consultant at Your People Associates said employers should embrace flexible working to combat any talent and retention worries. “Increased flexibility and allowing workers to be partly or fully remote is key to help them cut down on travel costs which will also help to increase productivity and retain talent” she said adding that organisations with profit at the end of the year could share the wealth and give employees a “one off” bonus.

Daniel Lucy principal researcher and consultant at the Institute for Employment Studies (IES) said travel costs were a growing issue for many but noted that people leaving for higher pay was often a “consequence of the decision to leave rather than the initial driver of intention to leave”.

“While pay is clearly important in the current context employers should not let pay become the sole explanation” he added.

Meanwhile Duncan Brown principal associate at the IES said he would ask why businesses could not afford increases when profit levels were still “holding up” and pay levels had been held back by employers over the past decade. “Average executive pay levels in our large companies increased by 39 per cent in the past 12 months. Not much sign of a cost crunch there” said Brown.

“Our advice to employers is to pay as much as you can afford and at least the real living wage to all making lump sum one-off payments especially to lower-paid staff if you can't afford to escalate base pay.”

But HR consultant Kunjan Zaveri argued that organisations should be wary of raising salaries or giving bonuses as it would inflate the internal equity. “The next two years are going to be difficult for the economy so it’s imperative for businesses to preserve their cash” he cautioned.

“Employers should consider enhancing their existing benefits package either through their EAP or [by engaging] financial advisory services to help employees gain valuable insight on managing their finances.”

For those who cannot afford to raise their pay Zoe Denny-Thomas senior equity consultant and equity communications practice leader for EMEA at Aon pointed out that businesses were increasingly utilising employee share plans to “encourage saving habits and long-term employee retention”.

“Employers looking to help employees through this tricky time are thinking outside the box in terms of support” said Denny-Thomas adding that companies are also “refocusing communications toward financial education and wellbeing and looking at the flexibility of programmes”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXRsYW50YWFnZW50bWFnYXppbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTEvdG9sbC1icm90aGVycy1jby1mb3VuZGVyLXJvYmVydC10b2xsLWRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toll Brothers co-founder Robert Toll dies,"by John Yellig

Robert Toll the co-founder and former chairman and CEO of national homebuilding giant Toll Brothers Inc. died of Parkinson’s disease at 81.

Toll served as chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers from its founding in 1967 until 2010 after which he remained on the company’s board of directors until recently stepping back to become chairman emeritus.

“We are heartbroken by the passing of our founder mentor and dear friend” Chairman and CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said in a news release. “All of us who were lucky enough to spend time with Bob have been forever impacted by his huge heart unique sense of humor zest for life and profound intelligence. Bob was a brilliant strategist and an incredible teacher and advisor.

Toll was born in 1940 and raised in the Philadelphia suburb of Elkins Park. After graduating from Cornell University and The University of Pennsylvania Law School he practiced law for one year before founding Toll Brothers with his younger brother Bruce Toll in 1967.

I went live on our YouTube channel (2nd City Gridiron) last night to walk through the film from the Bears-Vikings game! A link to the stream is available below.

In this stream I’m continuing a new format — I know many here have mentioned that 5 hours is (understandably) way too long to watch on a replay. With that in mind I’m going to try and spend the first 30-45 minutes talking through 10-15 key plays from the game before pivoting into the standard livestream.

After the stream I’ll take that chunk of video and cut it into its own release — my hope is that this will help create a “headline” review of the game while also allowing for the livestream to keep its audience-focused identity. Let me know if it works!

Throughout the stream I plan to talk through...

What changed for Justin Fields?

Where did the Bears’ running game go?

How should we expect this offense to perform moving forward?

Are there any other offensive things worth worrying about?

What happened on the Bears’ first 3 drives of the game?

How did the Bears adjust in the 2nd half?

What this game means for the rest of the season

And much much more...

Check it out and let me know what you think!

Under her leadership the team has expanded Rockwell’s portfolio of data-driven services in areas such as sustainability safety and productivity. Conrad also oversees cybersecurity services.

Conrad joined Rockwell’s leadership development program in 1997. She is an industrial engineer and was recognized as a 2017 STEP Ahead award recipient by the Manufacturing Institute. She is active in Rockwell’s Professional Women’s Council and the Society of Women Engineers.

“Rachael represents the leader that I myself and all who interact with her aspire to be” said Angela Rapko who reports to Conrad as North America vice president for lifecycle services. “She has driven significant change across a very mature organization by putting her people first developing and communicating a clear strategy and empowering the organization to execute on it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZHVvLmNvbS9kZWNpcGhlci9oYXJkY29kZWQtcHJpdmF0ZS1rZXktbGVhZHMtdG8tZnVsbC1jb250cm9sLW9mLXNvbWUtc2llbWVucy1wbGNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hardcoded Private Key Leads to Full Control of Some Siemens PLCs,"Many versions of the Siemens Simatic PLCs and the portal that communicates with the controllers contain hard coded cryptographic keys that an attacker can extract by exploiting a separate vulnerability and use to bypass the controllers’ other security protections and take complete control of the devices.

The weaknesses (CVE-2022-38465) affect the CPUs in the Simatic S7-1200 and S7-1500 PLCs as well as the TIA Portal which operators use to communicate with the controllers. Siemens has released updates to fix the vulnerabilities and has overhauled the cryptographic scheme in the firmware to use dynamic rather than static TLS encryption keys. The attack path for these vulnerabilities is complex and an attacker would need a deep knowledge of the way the Siemens portal and PLCs cooperate in order to be successful. But the potential effects of a successful attack could be quite serious.

“This is not trivial to exploit. You need an understanding of PLC architectures and security and a significant investment to understand how the encryption schemes work how to extract the key and other secret information. However once an attacker has the private key and related cryptographic knowledge they could create a malicious client replace the original engineering workstation program—TIA Portal in this case—and use it to execute multiple attacks such as (a malicious) upload/download of program logic perform man-in-the-middle attacks and more” said Sharon Brizinov director of security research at Claroty the security firm that discovered the flaws and developed the attack.

The affected PLCs are used in a wide range of industrial and manufacturing settings and the researchers said that while the vulnerabilities were difficult to find and exploit the consequences of an attacker doing so may be significant. For example an attacker who has knowledge of the way the Simatic PLCs work and how the firmware is built could execute remote code extract the private key and even implement a new malicious protocol stack.

""Executing the overwritten function gave us the full private key of the PLC.""

“PLCs are deterministic controllers and outputs are supposed to be always the same and on time. Any programmatic disruption to this can put physical safety at risk and also disrupt whatever automation process the PLC oversees. For example in a water treatment facility a valve controlling chemicals is supposed to open within a certain number of seconds and any deviation could affect drinking water safety” Brizinov said.

Claroty’s research team began by reverse engineering the firmware for a S7-1200 PLC and discovered that the private key was not contained in the firmware so they needed to gain access to the memory of the PLC itself. After some more work they discovered a remote code execution flaw (CVE-2022-15782) in the PLCs which enabled them to get read/write access to the controller.

“Using the DA read permission we obtained we were able to extract the entire encrypted PLC firmware (SIMATIC S7-1500) and map its functions. During the mapping process we found a function that read the private key on the PLC. Once we had the function address we rewrote the functionality of specific MC7+ opcodes with our shell code forcing them to call the native function that reads the private key. We then copied the key to a known memory address and read it from there. Executing the overwritten function gave us the full private key of the PLC” the researchers said in a blog post.

That private key was the same across the entire Siemens S7 product line. The researchers were then able to use their same methodology to extract the configuration key from the controller’s CPU which gave them the ability to implement their own protocol stack encrypt and decrypt communications and configurations.

“Siemens recommends to update both the affected products as well as the corresponding TIA Portal project to the latest versions. TIA Portal V17 and related CPU firmware versions introduced protection of confidential configuration data based on individual passwords per device and TLS-protected PG/PC and HMI communication” Siemens said in its advisory.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbWlsd2F1a2Vlbm5zLm9yZy8yMDIyLzEwLzExL2VybmVzdG8tY2hhY29uLXRvLWJlLWhvbm9yZWQtZm9yLXJvbGUtaW4tZmlnaHRpbmctZm9yLWNpdmlsLXJpZ2h0cy1mb3ItbWlsd2F1a2Vlcy1sYXRpbm9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ernesto Chacon to be honored for role in fighting for civil rights for Milwaukee's Latinos,"Ernesto Chacon 84 now spends his free time working on a book about his experiences. “A downside of being an organizer is that you’re never satisfied” he says. “But we did our part in getting the resources to the community. Now it’s this generation’s job to protect them.” (Photo by PrincessSafiya Byers)



Ernesto Chacon will be honored Friday by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Roberto Hernández Center for his role in winning civil rights for Latinos in Milwaukee and at the university.

Chacon 84 played a key part in the Latino community’s fight for change and justice in Wisconsin.

“Awarding Ernesto is just the right thing to do” said Alberto Maldonado the director of the Roberto Hernández Center at UWM. “Ernesto is a part of that small group of individuals from the community that helped Roberto (Hernández) organize stage protests and advocate for these services to exist.”

The Roberto Hernández Center provides Latino students at UWM with academic financial aid and other services. Hernández who died in 1994 was instrumental in getting such services to Latino students.

Do you have feedback on Milwaukee NNS's reporting? Take our survey to let us know how we're doing! I'll take the survey!

According to Maldonado Chacon’s impact is still felt today.

He was a part of a series of protests against Milwaukee’s Allen-Bradley Co. to get the manufacturer now owned by Rockwell Automation to hire Black and Latino workers. He spent years rallying for welfare reform or advocating for Latino rights.

And in the years that followed Chacon took on leadership roles in some of the groups and organizations that grew out of the protests.

He served as president of the Federation for Civic Action and worked as the deputy director of the Milwaukee office of former Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle.

Born in Pearsall Texas Chacon is the seventh of 12 children.

As a child he joined the Catholic Youth Organization for which he traveled with migrant farmworkers while they labored in the fields.

“It was like a project to learn about conditions in the field and that kind of a life” Chacon said. “Then we would go back and report to our priest and leaders of the project.”

In his junior year of high school he traveled to the Midwest with the migrant farmworkers who he had been studying.

Chacon said his job with the migrant workers involved writing letters back home for the workers cleaning houses and picking up mail.

“The workers would talk about how much they loved their families and how much of the work they did were for them and it made me feel like my family loved me like that even though they never said it directly” he said.

While with the workers Chacon got a firsthand look at injustice.

“I learned a lot about life in terms of how people struggled to survive and what they had to do to support their families” he said. “It was an interesting point for me because I didn’t understand why people had to travel so far to earn a living for their families and from there I began to see what I would do once I finished high school.”

Though not a migrant worker himself Chacon worked with La Raza Unida a former Hispanic political party early in the Chicano movement. He also was involved with the Wisconsin part of the 1965 United Farm Workers grape boycott.

Right out of high school he took a job with UMOS the United Migrant Opportunities Services in Milwaukee working with migrant farm workers who were going through the state of Wisconsin.

Through his work he met Jesús Salas another key figure in the Chicano movement.

Also from Texas Salas said he’d heard about Chacon before they met because Chacon was a high school athlete.

“In ’68-69 he (Chacon) joined our picket lines and I was able to learn from him as an organizer” Salas said. “He’s fully dedicated to his work and the community.”

In 1970 Chacon was arrested at a welfare rally after a scuffle with a police officer.

“It ended up being over a year-long thing before me and José (another organizer) were sentenced to six months in the house of corrections” Chacon said. “Then those same people that I was marching with started protesting for my release.”

Chacon said he was eventually pardoned by the governor under the stipulation that he would not be involved in any more demonstrations. He was pictured a few months later at a protest in the UWM chancellor’s office in Milwaukee.

“I just felt like no one was going to tell me what to do with my life” he said. “MLK and Cesar Chavez had been to jail who am I? If the people were there I was there too.”

Salas who later served on the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents said one of Chacon’s biggest contributions was his ability to unite Latinos.

“Latinos are very diverse and don’t always get along” Salas said. “But Chacon was intentional about uniting everyone and that has allowed us to move forward without the tensions you might see in other communities.”

“A lot of our work was with (Father) James Groppi and the commandos” Chacon added. “After the Allen-Bradley marches Latino people and Black people realized we had a lot of the same struggles and started working together more.”

Groppi was also a civil rights activist in Milwaukee.

Chacon said he is proud of the work he has done but it doesn’t feel like enough.

“A downside of being an organizer is that you’re never satisfied” he said. “But we did our part in getting the resources to the community. Now it’s this generation’s job to protect them.”

These days Chacon is living a quieter life on Milwaukee’s South Side and is working on a book about his experiences.

“If I could do it all again it’d be fewer marches and more seminars and workshops” he said. “The streets can give us victory but education is key.”

Image credit: Shutterstock/HappyBall3692

Before the days of computers data analysis was done with teams of low-skilled labor punching away at mechanical calculators and filling up large handwritten ledgers with results. The team was typically led by a data scientist looking to find quantitative results. In the 1980s computer technology had entered homes and businesses and the electronic spreadsheet quickly took over. Software-based data analysis now replaced those teams of calculator punchers. More recently data analysis software is beginning to even replace the data scientist – allowing decision-makers instant access to useful high-level information.

Types of Data Analysis Software Suppliers

Data analysis software can be divided up into three major categories: optimization software phenomenon analysis and predictive modeling. Data analysis for optimization is useful for tasks such as managing a supply chain directing traffic on web pages solving complex engineering problems or budgeting.

The prize is the Money in the Bank contract enclosed in a briefcase which guarantees its holder a one-time shot at any championship within a year's time. The contract has allowed new stars to jumpstart their careers and established stars to add to their list of accomplishments. It has also provided some of the most memorable ladder match moments in wrestling history as superstars have cashed in their contracts at opportune and often unexpected times.

Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins was crowned the new WWE United States Champion on the season premiere of ""WWE Raw"" this week.

Shortly before Bobby Lashley prepared to defend his title he was attacked by the returning Brock Lesnar who proceeded to drop The All Mighty with two F5s a German Suplex and eventually locked in the Kimura Lock.

With Lashley grimacing in pain his title defense against Rollins was put in doubt with the announcers questioning the reasons for Lesnar's actions. As the referees continued to check on Lashley at ringside Rollins made his way to the ring with his ribs taped up following his Fight Pit bout against Matt Riddle at Extreme Rules. Rollins then demanded that Lashley get in the ring and fight him even as the referees convinced Lashley to retreat to the back.

Rollins then got on the microphone and mentioned how Lashley is supposed to be a fighter a champion and a soldier but is actually a disgrace to the United States Title and a disgrace to his country! An infuriated Lashley then limped down to the ring with his left arm dangling as he continued to ignore calls from WWE officials to not wrestle.

Once the bell rang Lashley immediately attempted a Spear but Rollins countered with a Pedigree. However Lashley kicked out at two following which Rollins hit a top rope frog splash followed by a Stomp attempt which Lashley evaded. Eventually Rollins targeted Lashley's injured left arm and finished off Lashley with a Stomp.

While the era of ROH under Silkin's watch was highly praised it wasn't exactly a financial success. During an interview with Wrestling Inc. Senior News Editor Nick Hausman Silkin said he thought the deal with HDNet thanks to Mark Cuban was going to be a breakthrough.

""The problem was and I didn't know at the time I should have done some more research but I wouldn't have turned them down no matter what but they only had... five percent of the country could see them.""

Silkin revealed that ROH lost ""a lot"" of money when he ran the company. He confirmed that ROH lost millions of dollars but not tens of millions.

""No but here's the thing Nick I knew we had a good thing. I knew it I knew it I knew it. I'd been watching wrestling since the late '60s and I'm not an expert about anything but I knew we had a good thing. I also knew that we're not going to be able to compete with WWE.

""I always thought it was a work when I was [watching] when they were on. But I liked those a lot even though I thought they were fake. Once I found out it was real it just brought a whole different level of magic to it so I would love to see something like that come back again.""

Since Levesque took over as head of creative he's brought concepts he utilized in ""NXT"" to the main roster such as the the Fight Pit match between Seth Rollins and Matt Riddle at Extreme Rules and the WarGames matches scheduled for Survivor Series this November. Prinze Jr. hopes Levesque continues this trend and also adds some vintage flair to WWE programming.

""I think they'll start bringing some old school stuff back"" Prinze said. ""I mean Triple H is a true student of the game. He's a historian; he knows everything there is to know about wrestling.""

Bobby Lashley knows what it's like to perform at the highest level in WWE but he hasn't lost sight of his WWE run being a dream come true. Lashley the now-former WWE United States Champion has just about done it all in the industry. At the age of 46 he remains a top star in WWE but he stays humble.

During an appearance on SiriusXM's ""Busted Open Radio"" Lashley was asked how he feels about being viewed as the top babyface on the ""WWE RAW"" brand. Lashley said that the slew of hungry performers in WWE actually makes him take a step back and realize that he's living the dream. ""I love our roster right now and that's what made me excited about winning the United States Title"" Lashley said. ""I had Ali last week. Ali's a guy that's kind of been overlooked a little bit but he is phenomenal. Great wrestler great mind for the business. So you have him you have [Matt] Riddle that's on fire right now you have Seth Rollins he's Seth Freaking Rollins. He's great across the board.""

Lashley went on to talk about his close friends MVP Shelton Benjamin and Cedric Alexander. The four men were a part of The Hurt Business and Lashley wants the faction to reunite down the road. ""Some of my closest friends even favorites The Hurt Business MVP's there with Omos and Shelton Benjamin's still doing his stuff Cedric's there"" Lashley said. ""I'd like to bring that group back together at some point in time."" Despite dropping the US Title to Rollins on ""Raw"" Lashley now seems likely to take on Brock Lesnar in a high-profile rematch at Crown Jewel on November 5.

The fast-fashion retailer will open 14 new stores across the country including a new location at the Gran Plaza Outlets in Calexico Calif. which opened in August 2022. The Calexico store is the first in a series of Forever 21 openings scheduled to roll out across America through June 2023. (See complete list of the upcoming new stores at end of article.)

You’re long overdue for a vacation but there are so many options for how to spend your precious PTO! With getaways ranging from unique vacation home rentals across the country cruises across the globe and even luxurious all-inclusive resorts the decision can be tough but let’s be honest here - nothing quite rivals the care-free thrilling experience that you can only get on a cruise ship.

Once that you’ve decided you’re ready to hit the high seas the next decision you have to make is a tricky one – choosing the right cruise.

While any cruise is better than no cruise you can’t go wrong with the cruise industry’s two prominent leaders – Royal Caribbean and Disney Cruise Line. While Disney is a brand that everyone knows and loves renowned for world-class guest service and creating magical family-friendly memories Royal Caribbean has become synonymous with epic adventures and mind-blowing experiences.

Earlier this summer I sailed on the Disney Wish and Mariner of the Seas the same week which gave me the opportunity to compare and contrast the two lines in quick succession.

To help you figure out which cruise is best for you here are five major things to consider when picking your cruise line.

Wallet economics

For most budget is the big deciding factor when making most of your vacation decisions.

If you’ve ever been to one of the Disney parks it should come as no surprise that Disney cruises often come at a premium cost. Until the most recent Disney+ subscriber promotion discounted rates are extremely limited almost exclusively to military members and Florida residents.

With that in mind once you’ve locked in your Disney Cruise Line stateroom if you do manage to see a better rate you have to cancel and rebook in most cases. Luckily you can save money on your Disney cruise with Disney Visa rewards dollars using your Disney Visa credit card or by purchasing discounted Disney gift cards from places like Sam’s Club or Costco.

Alternatively Royal Caribbean is known for offering great sales during the year ranging from $550 off + 30% off guests kids sail free and more. With that in mind Royal Caribbean also runs sales on their cruise add-ons like drink packages wi-fi and more.

Often cruisers get the option to bid on upgrading to a better category room close to the departure date with Royal Caribbean’s Royal Up program. Just like Disney Royal Caribbean has their own Visa card that offers rewards ranging from onboard credits and stateroom upgrades to cruises.

To put this in full perspective looking at two similar cruises out of Miami Royal Caribbean offers a 4-night cruise starting at $896 for two adults whereas Disney is offering a 3-night cruise for two adults starting at $1734.

When it comes to counting dollars and cents the undeniable winner is Royal Caribbean.

Sleeping arrangements

One major consideration that often goes overlooked is your stateroom.

The common misconception is that all cruise staterooms are tiny hole-in-the-walls akin to a can of sardines where you all pack in just to sleep.

Wrong!

With the right stateroom you can create a home on the high seas that keeps everyone happy and most importantly comfy!

Cruise staterooms range from budget-friendly space-efficient inside staterooms some with virtual portholes to create a faux window to the seas outside to luxurious suites like the fun-tastic Royal Caribbean Ultimate Family Suite or the extra-magical Disney Cruise Line Funnel Tower Suite.

While actual staterooms available vary ship to ship on average Disney Cruise Line takes the win when comparing the size of the most common stateroom types.

For example an inside stateroom on most Royal Caribbean ships is around 150 square feet while on most Disney ships inside staterooms are closer to 170 square feet.

Similarly ocean view rooms on Royal Caribbean start at 180 square feet compared to Disney’s 204 square feet with ocean view balcony rooms on Royal Caribbean starting at 188 square feet and Disney’s verandah rooms starting at a stunning 246 square feet.

Although Disney Cruise Line undisputedly boasts the larger rooms Royal Caribbean is not to be overlooked with its wide variety of room types including staterooms with a view of their Promenade or Boardwalk area (perfect for people-watching and observing onboard fun right from your interior balcony) a variety of suite class staterooms with upgraded amenities and the favorite for larger groups – the ultra spacious rooms.

On many Royal Caribbean ships the ultra spacious ocean view or ocean view balcony staterooms offer a larger stateroom with a separated bunk bed area that’s ideal for adding some privacy and extra space when you’re traveling with a larger crew. The closest option to this on Disney Cruise Line is the deluxe family staterooms. These rooms are slightly larger to accommodate up to five and have a curtain you can pull out to create a partition.

Another great accommodation for bigger parties is the connecting balcony stateroom category on Royal Caribbean which allows two staterooms to share a balcony and even a connecting door inside as well if you’d like. This creates a spacious option for larger parties. With this in mind both cruise lines offer swanky one- and two- bedroom suites that come with concierge service and extra perks for when you want both space and to treat yourself to luxury on the high seas.

Obviously your options for staterooms are plentiful on both cruise lines and any stateroom is better than being stuck on dry land. That said there’s no clear winner in this category so it’s up to you to pick which one better suits your sailing needs.

Forktastic dining options

The food on a cruise is truly the best part. Did you know the average cruiser gains upwards of seven pounds on a cruise? If you go hungry while cruising that’s truly your own fault. That said there are some big differences between the dining experience on Royal Caribbean and that of Disney Cruise Line.

Dinner is where Disney Cruise Line truly shines as they bring the magic and performance art you’re used to seeing at the parks straight into the main dining room.

Once onboard you’ll receive a dining rotation to let you know which dining room to report to each night for your decadent dinner show. Disney Cruise Line’s dinner is an event in itself as each dining room and menu is heavily themed along with some form of entertainment you’ll enjoy while you please your tastebuds.

These shows range anywhere from musical performances like New Orleans-style jazz to singing along with the your favorite Frozen moments to interactive conversations with digital Disney characters like Crush from Finding Nemo and Olaf or watching Ant-Man and The Wasp showcase their latest and greatest technology.

While Disney truly does dinner like no one else at sea Royal Caribbean still satisfies your palette with a diverse list of specialty options that varies from ship to ship.

Each night you can choose to enjoy your evening meal at the Windjammer buffet sit down to a divine three-course meal in one of the main dining halls or you can take it up a notch with the heat of hibachi of Izumi or the mind-boggling wonders of molecular gastronomy found in Wonderland among a myriad of other options depending on the ship you’re on.

However when considering dietary options like vegan and gluten-free for instance Royal Caribbean doesn’t quite keep up with Disney in this category. All of Disney’s destinations cruise ships included truly shine when it comes to special dietary needs. They don’t just give you a few run-of-the-mill dietary friendly options they craft delicious culinary creations that are on par with everything else they serve.

That’s not to say that you can’t have your dietary needs met on Royal Caribbean as they also do a great job making sure all diners eat incredibly well but there truly isn’t a major cruise line that offers the specialty food options that Disney does.

For this particular category it’s a close call as Disney wins in the dinner and dietary needs arena but Royal Caribbean takes the cake for overall dining variety across the ship.

Entertain me!

When choosing a cruise it’s important to think about what you ideally would like to actually do once you get on the ship.

Are you in need of some intensive rest and relaxation? Maybe you need some dedicated time to really burn some calories or you want to release your inner dare devil? Have you always wanted to try your hand at a blackjack table? Has it been too long since your last live theater show?

With so many things to experience on cruise ships and with the vast array of options you can find on different ships knowing what activities and entertainment options you would like can help solidify which cruise line and even which specific ships are perfect for you.

If you’re looking for rest and relaxation Disney Cruise Line surprisingly boasts one of the most unique spa experiences at sea – the Rain Forest Room by Senses Spa.

This is a private area with a limited number entries (purchased separately) offering guests a number of ways to unwind from steam rooms to hot tubs (on most ships) heated tile loungers rain showers and more. This is also the most quiet zen space you’ll ever find on a cruise ship.

If you don’t want to pay extra for the Rain Forest Room but are still looking for a kid-free place to relax have no fear there are adult-only pool and hot tub areas across all Disney ships.

While Disney ships do specialize in rest and relaxation they also have a lot to do on their ships. Every ship has a gym with great equipment including treadmills overlooking the water and a variety of fitness classes (some included some cost extra). There are also sports courts jogging tracks pools and hot tubs water slides and so much more.

There’s also incredible entertainment for all ages ranging from first run movies in a relaxed movie theater setting to stellar entertainment akin to the amazing shows you see in the parks. Depending on the ship there are classics like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid as well as unique shows like The Golden Mickeys and Seas the Adventure.

Of course don’t forget about the character experiences across the ship and the infamous Pirate Night on select cruises where you’ll celebrate your inner scalawag with pirate activities and even fireworks at sea.

If you’re ready for some blood-pumping thrills at sea Royal Caribbean has dedicated their entire fleet to creating a bolder experience at sea that you’d never even think was possible.

Over the past few years Royal Caribbean has taken cruising to a whole new level by “amplifying” their fleet of ships with a bevy of new experiences from dining and Broadway-style entertainment to never-before-seen activities. For those who can’t sit still this ranges from ice skating rock climbing Flow Rider simulated surfing and laser tag to RipCord by iFly simulated skydiving SkyPad bungee trampoline escape rooms and so much more.

If you’re looking to be entertained the unique Aqua Theater brings you water shows with spectacular stunts and incredible feats of athleticism like you’ve never seen. Once you’ve dried off you can head to the indoor theater for classic performances like Grease and Mama Mia! many ships also feature ice skating shows or you can check out any number of musical acts at venues across the ship. If you’re looking to test your luck with cards or slots each ship also boasts a casino with your choice of games to try.

If you’ve never gambled before don’t worry at the start of each cruise there are classes to teach you how to play.

While there might be a ton of things on the itinerary there are also great ways to unwind from adult pool and hot tub areas to booking your very own spa mani/pedi or hair appointment at the Senses Spa which is the exact same spa you’ll find on Disney Cruise Line as well.

This particular category is tough one to choose a winner for depending on what kind of cruise you’re really looking for but ultimately if you’re looking to find some zen Disney Cruise Line takes the gold but if you’re in the market for thrills and shenanigans Royal Caribbean is the undisputed champion in that arena.

Private islands & destinations

While a big part of what makes a cruise special is what happens on the ship the destination ports are a hugely important consideration as this is a great way to get a bite-sized taste of places and cultures you’ve never experienced.

Disney Cruise Line boasts 5 very lovely ships with itineraries heavy in the Caribbean as well as Alaska the Mexican Riviera the Mediterranean and a few other locations depending on the time of year with new itineraries being added on a regular basis.

The tricky part for Disney Cruise Line is that with such a small fleet in comparison to other cruise lines they are mildly limited on the variety of available ports and destination options. That said there are still plenty of options to choose from including their magical private island Disney’s Castaway Cay.

Castaway Cay is an intimate Bahamian escape with some really special unique experiences you won’t find anywhere else. For the runners and walkers looking to get some extra steps in there’s a complimentary steamy hot 5k course complete with a finisher’s medal upon crossing the finish line.

There’s also a beautiful bike route that cruises by a lookout tower multiple cabana areas (including the adults-only Serenity Bay) and a massive snorkeling area with special sunken treasures ready for you to come and find them. In the works for 2024 is a brand new Bahamian private island Disney’s Lighthouse Point. Little has been released about what should be expected at this new location but it’s sure to be spectacular.

On the other side Royal Caribbean boasts an astonishing fleet of 25 ships in varying sizes that offer itineraries visiting over 240 destinations in 61 countries ranging from the Caribbean and Alaska to Asia and Australia even the upcoming 274-night Ultimate World Cruise as well as two fabulous private islands – Labadee Haiti and Perfect Day at Coco Cay Bahamas.

Labadee is absolutely picturesque with lush green mountains overlooking a crystalline sea. The coastline is dotted with experiences of all types from relaxing private cabanas to epic water slides and aquatic fun even a roller coaster that will take you on a scenic journey across this totally Instagram-able escape.

Not too far away is the new Perfect Day at Coco Cay which is no lie there’s a perfect day awaiting for everyone no matter your interests. If you’re into high-speed water park fun there’s Thrill Waterpark featuring Daredevil’s Peak – the tallest water slide in North America. Looking for to soak up some rays in your own private cabana?

Hickey declined to disclose the amount of the bid but said it was viewed as 'satisfactory' (not rejected).

Now the Disney prospect has surfaced.

Disney expected to get the ship

While Hickey thinks Disney likely will get Global Dream and operate it in the US — not Asia as has been speculated — he still hopes his group will be able to acquire another former Genting Hong Kong ship World Dream at auction in Singapore. And they even have their eyes on Genting Dream currently sailing for Resorts World Cruises on lease from a consortium of Chinese banks as well as two new (existing) expedition ships.

The four ships would operate in Asia with Hickey envisioning World Dream and Genting Dream potentially under one brand and the two expedition ships another.

Hickey was SVP international for Princess Cruises and Carnival plc chief representative officer of Carnival China and president of Carnival Japan. He sits on the board of Blue World Acquisition Corp. a SPAC that raised $100m and is pursuing opportunities in the cruise industry but is separate from this strategy he outlined at length to Seatrade Cruise News.

Current Asia backdrop

Hickey sees Asia as particularly ripe for cruise development now because there's a void of operators.

Genting Hong Kong collapsed and Resorts World Cruises currently sails just the one leased ship.

Carnival Corp. & plc has its joint venture with CSSC CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping to build for the Chinese market. But Costa Cruises and Princess Cruises formerly prominent regional players have exited for now.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings came and went.

Hickey sees Royal Caribbean International and MSC Cruises as committed to Asia where he predicts they'll field very large ships — leaving a window for an operator with slightly smaller vessels viable for wider deployment with more itinerary options and multinational sourcing.

'A wholesale withdrawal from Asia will take at least five years to wind back up. For those who elect to stay there will be five years of limited competition and a very healthy commercial environment' Hickey said.

Disney reportedly has two-month option for Global Dream

Hickey's group was among those bidding for the 9000-passenger 208000gt Global Dream that sits unfinished at MV Werften.

According to Hickey KfW IPEX-Bank and export credit agency Euler Hermes have given Disney a two-month exclusive option and he expects the German authorities will choose Disney as the operator in a plan where Meyer Werft — which builds for DCL at Papenburg — would manage the completion of that vessel at MV Werften Wismar.

Disney has not commented about Global Dream and MV Werften insolvency administrator Christoph Morgen told Seatrade Cruise News he's working on 'various options' for Global One and in negotiations with 'various interested parties.' No binding contracts have been concluded.

Morgen confirmed completion in Wismar is the preferred solution.

Ship's configuration would work for Disney

Many parties reportedly looked at Global Dream but opted out in part due to its special configuration of quad cabins many connecting a design suited to Asian family travelers. Pointing to Disney's family market and ships with many connecting rooms Hickey thinks Global Dream would work well for Disney.

And he'd expect the ship to be based in the US since in Asia 'the only place you could put that ship and expect to fill it with 9000 people is Shanghai.' There are many 'unknown risks deploying ships in China now' he added. Disney lacks a distribution structure there and he's not sure about synergies with Shanghai Disney Resort.

While Disney also has theme parks in Hong Kong and Tokyo deployment from Tokyo would mean a longer cruise itinerary not feasible for such a large vessel and he doesn't see Hong Kong working either.

'Political football' in Germany

Whether all the issues with Global Dream's completion for any operator can be worked out remains to be seen. The ship has been described as a 'political football' in Germany.

The pressure for a solution is buildng since MV Werften's Wismar yard with its gigantic covered building dock was acquired by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems in June with plans to convert the facility for submarine production and perhaps naval surface vessels.

World Dream

As for Hickey's group though they'd hoped to secure Global Dream and World Dream in a joint deal even if Global is off the table they're still keen on World Dream. This former Genting HK ship operated for Dream Cruises until its arrest in Singapore by KfW IPEX-Bank in March.

Hickey doubts Disney is interested in World Dream and he sees few other viable suitors for the 150695gt ship delivered in 2017.

It remains anchored off Singapore with auction pending. In Hickey's view something will happen with World Dream before year's end as it's scheduled for drydock maintenance in late December. A new owner/operator could take advantage of that to make any changes needed to bring World Dream into service in early 2023.

Genting Dream

KT Lim's new company Resorts World Cruises began operating Genting Dream from Singapore in June. That 2016-built ship has been owned by a group of Chinese banks since 2020 and previously was leased to Dream Cruises so it was not part of the Genting HK insolvency.

According to Hickey Resorts World is committed to two years of operations from Singapore with Genting Dream.

However he thinks the owning Chinese banks are open to other potential operating scenarios for the ship.

China potential

Hickey believes oversupply crushed the nascent Chinese cruise market prior to the pandemic shutdown.

'It's not that that market is inherently flawed ... It was oversupplied and overhyped' he said. 'Supply crushed it. There was never a demand problem.'

When China reopens he thinks Royal Caribbean and MSC Cruises will do well operating their biggest and best new ships — one each — from Shanghai. The destinations for very big ships on shorter cruises from there though are limited: Cheju South Korea and Fukuoka Japan.

Hickey called Royal Caribbean a 'very experienced stable healthy competitor. They're not disruptive they're constructive. Other brands can compete with them and do well' adding: 'MSC will come in with new hardware and I believe they'd be a rational competitor in that market.'

Multifacted sourcing deployment plan

Hickey's group if it can secure slightly smaller ships like World Dream envisions richer more varied itineraries and multifacted customer sourcing including North Asia markets like China Taiwan and Japan.

Hickey said Taiwan generated impressive yields when Majestic Princess operated there and it was a good market for Star Cruises and more recently Dream Cruises.

He was instrumental in developing the Princess and Carnival plc market in Japan so he knows it well.

Expedition ships

Pre-pandemic Chinese were the fastest growing source market for Antarctica. Yet expedition lines have not created products specifically/exclusively for Chinese travelers or for Japanese.

Hickey said two new expedition ships are available and his group is considering the possibilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9zcG90dGVkLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1yYWlzZXMtYmFzZS1wcmljZS1jb2NrdGFpbHMtYW5kLWRyaW5rLXBhY2thZ2UtYmVuZWZpdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spotted: Royal Caribbean raises base price for cocktails and drink package benefit,"The cost of a cocktail on your cruise will probably be a bit higher on your next sailing.

Guests sailing on a variety of ships are reporting seeing the average price of a signature cocktail up from $13 to $14 per drink before gratuity.

The exact cost of a cocktail depends on a few factors such as the type of liquor but Royal Caribbean had priced many of its drinks on its menu at $13 per drink for a few years.

For years some ships had cocktails priced at $12 while others had them at $13. Since cruises restarted in 2021 the price stabilized across the fleet at $13.

Certain drink menus are now showing a $14 drink cost on sailings that have departed over the last few days. An automatic 18% gratuity will be added to that cost for drinks purchased a la carte.

In case you're wondering the price of a beer is listed at $7.49 for domestic beers and $7.99 for imports. Red Stripe will cost you $8.25.

Many wines by the glass are still around $10-14 per glass.

While the individual Royal Caribbean drink prices have gone up by a dollar your Royal Caribbean drink package benefits have also gone up to match it.

Guests who have gotten letters from Crown and Anchor Society with their Diamond benefits noted their vouchers now cover drinks in value up to $14.

Many cruisers opt to purchase an unlimited drink package to help control drink prices while onboard. For a flat fee you can enjoy all the beers cocktails juices sodas premium coffees and teas and bottled water you want.

The cost of a Royal Caribbean drink package will vary from sailing to sailing and ship to ship.

On average the Deluxe Beverage Package (unlimited alcohol package) will cost somewhere between $65.00 - $90.00 per person per day for a drink package when purchased onboard.

Read more: How much is the drink package on Royal Caribbean?

While the overall cost a drink package isn't necessarily cheap a lot of people like the fact a drink package offers fixed costs and convenience of being able to order drinks anytime they see fit without concern of running up a big bill or being stuck with a drink they do not like.

Still cheaper than a lot of places on land

If paying $14 for your next pina colada sounds like a lot you may feel a little bit better knowing a cocktail on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship is likely cheaper than a lot of other tourist destinations.

Walt Disney World charges anywhere from $17 - $20 for a margarita at its La Cava del Tequila bar in Epcot. A Star Wars-inspired specialty cocktail at Oga’s Cantina in Hollywood Studios will run you $17 or $18 (not counting the Yub Nub $45 cocktail).

If you visit the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City you'll pay $14.75 for a Classic Caribbean Mojito and $15 for a Cosmopolitan.

At the Super Bowl earlier this year the signature cocktail ""Monday Morning Quarterback"" cost $16.

How to save money on drinks during your cruise

While Royal Caribbean's drink packages are quite popular with guests they do require a moderate amount of drinking every day of your cruise to make the investment worthwhile financially. For those that do not want to drink quite that much every day there are a number of alternative strategies to the drink package that can still save you some money.

Bring wine

Did you know that Royal Caribbean allows guests to bring up to two bottles of wine per stateroom on their Royal Caribbean cruise?

Each bottle of wine may be up to 750ml in size and should be brought on in your carry-on luggage. Do not put the wine in your checked luggage.

Wine lovers will be able to bring a couple of bottles of their favorite wine on their cruise at a savings compared to purchasing the wine onboard. Moreover bringing your own wine means you will save money on your total bar tab during your cruise.

My favorite aspect of bringing your own wine is if you do not finish the bottle of wine Royal Caribbean can store the wine for you and deliver it another restaurant at that time.

Look for drink specials onboard

One of the best ways to get a deal on a cocktail is to order the drink of the day. The drink of the day is a select cocktail that changes every day which has about a 20% discount on it and is available from most bars onboard.

You can just ask the bartender or waiter what the drink of the day is and take advantage of those savings.

To find drink specials consult the Cruise Compass for some advertised deals as well as walk around bars and look for posted signs.

Get free drinks

Free drinks on Royal Caribbean? Yes. Seriously!

Believe it or not there are ways to get free drinks on your Royal Caribbean cruise. Granted there is no way to effectively drink all day like this but any free drinks you can get are less drinks you have to buy!

One of the best ways to get free drinks is by being a Crown and Anchor Society member. Diamond level and above members are eligible for free beverages each day.

All Crown and Anchor Society members will have special coupons pre-loaded on their SeaPass account that provide deals like Buy One Get one beer wine or soda by the glass. In addition Royal Caribbean holds Crown and Anchor Society events onboard for members with complimentary cocktails served.

Free champagne can also be found at select events including art auctions Captain's Welcome and during holiday celebrations.

Drink in port

There is no question you will save money by drinking at the ports of call you visit compared to onboard.

Bars and restaurants at the ports your Royal Caribbean ship will visit regularly offer cheaper drink prices for beers and cocktails and that can mean big savings if you can wait to enjoy some drinks when on land compared to on your ship.

Depending on your itinerary this strategy may be more lucrative than others but it is a good way to indulge in your favorite mixed drink or cerveza for a lower cost."

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed. Abbe Lowell his lead defense lawyer said in a statement that the team will appeal the panel’s decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2Z1bGwtY291cnQtcHJlc3Mtd25iYS10di5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caitlin Clark Hype Will Test the W.N.B.A.'s Television Limits,"The decision makers for the docuseries “Full Court Press” chose wisely when selecting which women’s college basketball players they would follow for an entire season.

Kiki Rice from the University of California Los Angeles would be the talented but reserved young prospect.

Those selections proved fortuitous when each player advanced deep into the N.C.A.A. tournament. Clark and Cardoso competed in the most-watched women’s championship game in history before becoming two of the top three picks in the W.N.B.A. draft.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The 5.4 acre LEED Gold Salesforce Transit Center Park sits atop the new state-of-the-art Salesforce (previously known as Transbay) Terminal Center. The Transbay Terminal Center and Tower stand 70 feet-tall and stretch from Beale Street to Second Street. The structure houses commuter buses from around the area and provides the region with 5.4 acres of green space.

“Salesforce Transit Center is a landmark for the San Francisco Bay Area. A sociable open space for people to gather it’s grand and bold in design yet built for simply having a good time. This striking innovative and sustainable building transforms a transportation hub into an urban experience complete with a gondola and topped off by a 5.4-acre rooftop park open to the sky. The Transbay Transit Center was designed to centralize the region’s transportation network by conveniently connecting all points in the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 100000 passengers per day. The TJPA built a state-of-the-art bus and rail station – the “Grand Central Station of the West” – that will accommodate eleven transit systems from the Bay Area and Southern California. The new Transit Center will make world-class public transit options accessible seamless safe and efficient.” ~ Salesforce Transit Center

Salesforce paid $110 million to have its name on the Transbay Transit Center and an estimated $1.5 million per year will be spent on maintaining the park’s tranquility in the heart of San Francisco.

“The new Transit Center stretches for five blocks along Mission Street one block south of the city’s Financial District. A gently undulating wall floating above the street on angled steel columns is visible from afar creating a graceful luminous and welcoming image. At street level shops and cafes draw visitors and energize the surrounding neighborhood while high above the trees and flowers of the rooftop park invite people to visit for longer periods transforming the Transit Center from a commuter hub to an urban destination. The heart of the Transit Center’s design is the rooftop park. Dense with nature and activities it has over a dozen entry points potentially including bridges to surrounding buildings. Active and passive uses are woven into the landscape including a 1000-person amphitheater cafes and a children’s playground as well as quiet areas for reading picnicking or simply taking a break. The park presents a wide variety of Bay Area ecologies from oak trees to a wetland marsh.” ~ Pelli Clark Pelli Architects

The major project elements include:

• Two-block-long bus deck with direct freeway access for AC Transit WestCAT Amtrak Thruway and Greyhound buses and Muni service to Treasure Island (25)

• A ground level bus plaza serving six major Muni lines (5/5R 7 and 38/38R)

• A three-platform 6-track train station underground

• A Grand Hall entrance lobby and a rooftop park

Arup’s unique combination of consulting services provided the architectural team and the owner with real-world guidance and engineering inspiration.

“Arup’s involvement dates back to 1998 when we as part of the Richard Rogers Architecture/SMWM team were selected by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to prepare the Transbay Terminal Improvement Plan. We began work on concept validation in June 2008 and provided complete engineering design as well as bid phase and construction administration services though project completion. In total Arup provided complete civil geotechnical and bridge/highway engineering design services as well as transport and pedestrian planning extreme events evaluation pedestrian modelling fire and life-safety review tunnel ventilation design and rail coordination for this landmark addition to San Francisco’s mass transit infrastructure.” ~ Arup

The first phase of the Transbay Transit Center Project commenced in December 2008 with the groundbreaking of the Temporary Terminal. Demolition of the Transbay Terminal commenced in August 2010; the first phase was completed in August 2018.

“In September 2018 workers discovered two fissures in steel beams on the bus deck above Fremont Street. After several inspections and out of an abundance of caution the Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA) temporarily closed the Transit Center. This is a localized issue within the transit center. The TJPA’s contractor installed a multi-level shoring system at Fremont and First streets as an independent review and monitoring continue. No additional fissures have been found.” ~ TJPA Press Release 2019

PWP Landscape Architecture states “Salesforce Park was conceived of as a multifunctional space providing respite activity and education for transit users office workers and local residents alike.”

“The park design is composed of curving paths that lead visitors through different experiential settings both contemplative and social. In order to create a topography that blurs the distinction between roof and ground the park integrates mounded vegetated hills with domed architectural skylights that allow daylight into the terminal below. Feature gardens and special plantings highlight the plant communities that thrive in San Francisco’s Mediterranean climate and the relative warmth of this rooftop location. Public art punctuates the entire facility including the rooftop park with a dynamic Bus Jet Fountain by environmental artist Ned Kahn that expresses the movement of buses within the building below.” ~ PWP Landscape Architecture

Rana Creek the California-based company specializing in habitat restoration and regenerative design was selected the Lead Ecologist for the 5.4 acre Salesforce Transit Center Park in late September 2007. Paul Kephart Executive Director of Rana Creek stated “Rana Creek’s design will promote extensive energy savings for the Transbay Terminal Center as well as provide thriving habitats for Bay Area native plant and wildlife populations threatened by urban development. Not only will this green roof provide the people of San Francisco with a much needed public park it will protect the endangered species such as the Bay checkerspot butterfly that have all but disappeared from this urban area.”

Home to 600 trees and 16000 plants arranged in 13 different botanical feature areas see the Salesforce Transit Center Garden Guide for details.

Initially the name of the 5.4-acre rooftop park on top of the Transit Center was to be “City Park” but has been renamed Salesforce Transit Center Park. The massive rooftop park includes an open air amphitheatre gardens a trail for running/walking open grass areas for picnics lily ponds and more. Designed to house more than six native plant communities the Salesforce Terminal Center’s green roof features bodies of water statuesque trees and an urban park dedicated to sustainability.

The project treats all water from the neighboring 82-story Salesforce Tower as well as filters and processes the exhaust from the below railways. Kinetic fountains powered by the bus movement aerate the water for the rooftop wetlands. In order to create the most ecologically functional green roof Rana Creek used native plant communities such as grasslands that survive in similar bioregional conditions. The green roof build-up system consists of a root barrier and water drainage system.

Salesforce Transit Center has Gold certification under the LEED 2009 rating system. The building’s annual energy consumption is projected to be up to 25 percent lower than the 2008 Title 24 Energy Efficiency Standards in standing with Salesforce Transit Center’s commitment to environmental quality and sustainability.

Barrett’s RamTough 250 Hot Rubberized Asphalt was chosen for the two-block long bus deck to handle extensive vehicular and pedestrian traffic on a daily basis.

San Francisco City Guides: Created in partnership with the Transbay Joint Powers Authority which operates and manages the Transit Center the Salesforce Transit Center tour offers walkers the opportunity for a leisurely stroll of the stunning public spaces in this tour-de-force of post-modernist design to learn about its features both functional and fantastic. Led by trained and experienced volunteers from San Francisco City Guides walkers will tour the soaring Grand Hall experience the Center’s multimedia public art and a “secret garden” visit the renowned rooftop park of lush gardens and take in unmatched skyline views from among the tallest buildings in the West.

Announcements around data seemed to center around three common themes: Salesforce Genie Slack and the current economy. Going into more technical detail around each we’ll ensure you’re better prepared for the changes and advancements to come.

What’s next for Salesforce Genie

The term “Genie Magic” has created a lot of buzz (and questions) around the new data tool. Genie can seemingly take all of your data from multiple sources and combine it into one with the click of a button (live for CRM Analytics coming soon to Tableau). That’s data magic but the business use case is even better. Once all of your data is connected Genie can:

Make live predictions

Create data stories

Optimize decision making

Live data source predictions

Live data source predictions are a game-changer. Being able to see Einstein Predictions on a Salesforce record based on live external data (Snowflake Tableau and marketing sources — to name a few) creates more accurate predictions for your users fueling trust and adoption.

Genie can also take that live data and create data stories in plain language so that the user better understands what a dashboard is showing whether that user is a seasoned data analyst or someone new to data insights. This is a feature currently available in Tableau and making its debut in CRMA soon.

Decision Optimization

Decision Optimization is another great feature of Genie. Currently Einstein Discovery Recommended Actions are at the individual record level. These recommendations can be confusing if the end user is getting the same recommended actions on multiple records. Genie’s Decision Optimization takes these recommendations and aggregates them to provide a holistic view of what actions a user should take as well as the impact each action will have.

There may be ten accounts that recommend a new quote be created but one account will have a much greater impact on your pipeline versus the others. Taking an action recommended by Genie’s Decision Optimization also means that you’ll get real-time updated predictions so you can see how your actions are impacting your business immediately! Magic.

Genie promises a lot but if this new tool does what it says and does it as easily as it claims we’re in for a whole new world of data analysis.

Slack and CRM Analytics integration in action

While Slack integrations were not a new announcement at Dreamforce 2022 I was happy to see the analytics integrations in action. The analytics keynote session told a great story about how using Slack along with CRM Analytics allows users the insights they need without disrupting their workflow. The following are key features of the Slack-CRM Analytics integration:

Dashboard notifications

Collaboration

Actionable insights

You can currently set up dashboard notifications to get an email alert when data meets a set criteria (ex: an Opportunity has been in the pipeline for over six months). From the email you can open up the full dashboard in Salesforce to dive deeper. With the Slack integration you can now get these notifications in a Slack channel and expand the notification to see the full dashboard view without having to open Salesforce.

Using the example above the user is alerted that one of their team member’s Opportunities has been sitting in the pipeline for over six months. This person can now send this dashboard via Slack to their team members to start collaboration on how best to remedy this issue. As a part of collaboration Einstein is there to help make recommended actions on the Opportunity being discussed. If everyone decides that Einstein’s recommendation is the right path forward they can perform that action straight from Slack. The team has been alerted has collaborated and taken action on an Opportunity without leaving Slack. While Slack may not be the best place to house all of your work processes it seems like a great place for high-priority actionable insights.

How the current economy fits in — and data’s role in it

The metaphorical dark cloud over this year’s Dreamforce was the current state of our economy. Companies are looking for ways to cut costs and improve performance and Salesforce made it clear that data is the only way to do that.

There were many success stories from manufacturing to media showing how data can make a company more efficient and bring in more sales. Salesforce acknowledged that implementing a data culture can be a daunting task but showed what happens if you don’t have a data-centric company and some steps anyone can take to start their data journey. If your Salesforce architecture isn’t modeled around data outputs you risk tech debt poor analytics dependence on spreadsheets scope creep and overturn.

However if you can architect Salesforce around data and not just process you save money and time in the long run — two things that everyone could use a little more of right now. I was so happy to hear this messaging throughout Dreamforce 2022 because it’s always been the core philosophy here at Atrium: a data-driven approach will give you the greatest ROI on your Salesforce investment. So in the current economy it’s more important than ever to invest in your data.

Data-driven insights are your best bet for increased efficiency

It’s obvious that Salesforce is determined to bring analytics to everyone everywhere. Genie and Slack integrations with CRM Analytics and Tableau are making it possible for everyone to be a data master. And in times of uncertainty data-driven insights are going to help businesses be more efficient. I can’t wait to start implementing some of the new features I learned about and enhancing data insights for our customers.

We’re continuing to explore ways to bring teams together and facilitate employee connection from afar through technology. That’s why last year we announced Project Starline a technology project that enables coworkers to feel like they are together even when they are cities apart.

The technology works like a magic window where users can talk gesture and make eye contact with another person life-size and in three dimensions. It is made possible through major research advances across machine learning computer vision spatial audio and light field display systems.

Today Project Starline prototypes are found in Google offices across the U.S. with employees using the technology every day for meetings employee onboarding and building rapport between colleagues. Results show Project Starline can increase employee presence attentiveness and productivity compared to traditional video calling solutions. People have described the experience as a natural interaction — expressing how connected they felt to the other person sitting across from them.

Beyond Google employees we’ve also invited more than 100 enterprise partners in areas like media healthcare and retail to participate in demos at Google’s offices and provide us with feedback on the experience and applications to their businesses. We see many ways Project Starline can add business value across a number of industries and we remain focused on making it more accessible.

“The proliferation of hybrid work models is creating new opportunities to fundamentally rethink how we collaborate in the workplace” says Scott Morey president of technology & innovation at WeWork. “Project Starline is at the forefront of this shift providing an incredible user experience that bridges the gap between our physical and virtual worlds. At WeWork we believe this technology has the potential to enrich the employee experience – making connections more intentional and meaningful.""

Today we are expanding our testing efforts through an early access program with enterprise partners such as Salesforce WeWork T-Mobile and Hackensack Meridian Health . Starting this year we'll begin installing prototypes in select partner offices for regular testing."

Climate change activists broke all the front windows of Schlumberger’s Gould research centre on the University’s West Cambridge site in the early hours of Monday (10/10).

The activists said the destruction was in response to flooding in Pakistan which they attributed to climate change.

The direct action website This Is Not a Drill broke the news revealing the centre was chosen for its alleged significance to the fossil fuel industry.

Schlumberger is the world’s largest offshore drilling company and a top provider of oil and gas technology to fossil fuel companies around the world.

One activist said that Schlumberger does “untold harm to us” and claimed that their Cambridge centre featured a “test oil drill connected to huge tanks of mud to simulate drilling the seabed”.

“We’re so tired from the anger and despair we feel towards the University of Cambridge our government and other institutions that are supposed to be doing good but constantly and by default do the opposite” they said.

The activists also made it clear that they intended to escalate their direct action: “We’re done blocking roads and we’re done chanting. We’ve come to disarm fossil fuel companies wherever we find them and we call anyone else who can’t stand death and indifference any longer to join us.”

This event is the latest in a string of disruptions caused by climate change activists in Cambridge.

On a previous occasion activists protested the University’s alleged research links and sponsorship deals with BP Shell and Schlumberger by throwing black paint at buildings belonging to the Chemistry and Maths departments.

Similarly in January climate activists threw fake oil at Senate House also to protest against the University’s links to Schlumberger.

More dramatically at the end of Lent term last year Extinction Rebellion blockaded Schlumberger's research centre using a pink boat and a fake oil rig.

That protest resulted in several arrests before the activists eventually ended their blockade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL2J1c2luZXNzLWJ1enotbGFmYXlldHRlLWZpcm0tY291bGQtYmUtbGFyZ2VzdC13ZWItZGV2ZWxvcGVyLWluLWxvdWlzaWFuYS82OTU0NzI3OTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Buzz: Lafayette firm could be largest web developer in Louisiana,"Each week we’ll offer insights into new businesses developments and closings in the area.

Two Lafayette web firms are partnering to create one of the largest web development companies in the state Comit Developers announced this week.

Comit Developers is acquiring the web hosting development maintenance and security of Bizzuka’s web clients and its web development team — a partnership that would allow the Lafayette-based companies to have a larger footprint across the state.

“This acquisition will allow us to provide greater services to more companies across the country” Comit Developers co-founder Spencer Hoyt said in a release.

The two companies have more than 20 years of experience with web design digital marketing and customer service. The two firms have worked together before with Hoyt partnering with Bizzuka CEO John Munsell to provide search engine optimization support to Bizzuka clients in 2003.

Oilfield services company making Lafayette its hub for northern Gulf of Mexico operations

Around 113 new jobs could be coming to Acadiana after an oilfield services company announced it would be investing $11.5 million to centralize its North Gulf Coast divisions in Lafayette according to a release from Louisiana Economic Development.

More:Oil and gas company to invest $11.5 million in Lafayette 113 jobs coming to Acadiana

Schlumberger announced plans to consolidate the divisions at a newly-renovated hub in Lafayette which is expected to bring 44 new direct jobs and 69 indirect jobs to the Acadiana region while also retaining nearly 1400 existing jobs in Louisiana.

“Schlumberger has been an economic driver in Louisiana for more than half a century and the company remains a vital contributor to our state’s ""all of the above"" approach to energy” Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a release. “This investment not only creates dozens of high-paying jobs in Lafayette it demonstrates a commitment to the future of more than 1000 existing energy jobs around the state. In the midst of a historic transition Louisiana’s energy sector remains strong.”

The hub will be in the company's former Pathfinder office building in Lafayette Parish which is currently unoccupied. The building is undergoing extensive renovations that will result in 195 construction jobs at the peak of construction. The renovation is expected to be finished in 2025.

Schlumberger is one of the largest employers in Lafayette Parish ranking 19th with around 508 employees according to the Lafayette Economic Development Authority. The company also has operations in Morgan City New Iberia Berwick and Broussard.

Waitr delaying vote on reverse stock-split

Waitr Holdings the company that owns ASAP (formerly called Waitr) announced it is postponing its special stockholders meeting that was originally supposed to be held Oct. 6 until Oct. 20 saying the company did not have enough favorable votes to pass a reverse stock split.

The company is at risk of being delisted from the NASDAQ if its share price does not climb north of $1 and the reverse stock split has been the favored approach by the company’s leadership.

More:US could face a recession in 2023. Lafayette could still get more jobs

The reverse split would take between five and 20 of the company’s existing shares and combine them into a single share which would likely raise the price per share. The company had a vote earlier in the year on a similar measure but it failed to get a favorable vote from the majority of the shareholders.

Waitr Holdings said in a release that there is “significant support based on the shares that were voted by stockholders” but it still did not have a majority of all shareholders.

The company’s leaders have maintained that the reverse split is “necessary to ensure a share price high enough to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market.” Though the company has also made it clear that there is no guarantee that the price will hold at that level.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyYWxkaWFtb25kcy5jb20vaW4vZXBpYy1kaWFtb25kcy1pbi9yZS1lbnZpc2lvbmluZy1mbG9yYWxzLXdpdGgtdGlmZmFueS1jby1uZXctaGlnaC1qZXdlbGxlcnktY29sbGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tiffany & Co.'s BOTANICA Floral High jewellery Collection,"One of the most recognized names in diamonds Tiffany & Co. unveiled their latest High Jewellery creations and Only Natural Diamonds spoke with Tiffany’s Chief Gemologist Victoria Reynolds in an exclusive interview about some of the most stunning pieces from the new collection.

The jewellery is the third and final expression of BOTANICA: Blue Book 2022. BOTANICA released in three waves beginning in Spring 2022 with the second this Summer all with floral-inspired designs from The Tiffany Archives as well as Jean Schlumberger masterpieces. The pieces reimagine floral motifs that have long been a part of Tiffany’s heritage but for a new generation. Wisteria magnolia and orchid are inspirations for the floral designs and we learned why orchid was among the most technically challenging to bring to life.

Nature has long been an inspiration for jewellery design. Precious metals and natural diamonds are from the earth so what better to use as design inspiration than flowers? Reynolds explains “Re-envisioning nature is something that has been deeply ingrained in Tiffany’s heritage and identity from the beginning of our nearly two-century history. In creating the BOTANICA collection we knew it was critical to find the right balance between honoring our heritage and maintaining a sense of modernity. We were able to achieve this by reimagining some of our most important floral themes that our designers have dreamt up over many years.

We’ve revisited motifs from our heritage. Everything from orchid brooches and Louis Comfort Tiffany’s dandelion hair ornaments to wisteria glass lampshades re-emerge as innovative and transformable jewels. Additionally Jean Schlumberger’s floral themes are uplifted with special gemstone combinations giving new life to his most remarkable creations.

A floral design and a design inspired by florals are two very different articles. A floral design is a much more literal interpretation directly resembling the flower while a design inspired by florals if done well captures the essence of the flower without directly resembling it. Tiffany’s new creations offer many aha moments as you continue to look each piece’s inspiration comes to you. According to Reynolds “Honoring the botanical splendor and organic curves of an orchid flower our designers and master craftspeople collaborated to re-envision the flower’s distinctive profile. This theme’s intriguing silhouettes and rhythmic pattern of diamonds modernize the orchid motif while honoring its significance to our heritage making the two indelibly intertwined.”

Perhaps the sexiest flower in nature the orchid is the perfect muse for fine diamond jewellery. “This theme highlights an orchid’s most unique element: its fluid curves. Tiffany & Co. artisans captured the sensual organic curves yet unique symmetry elevating its elegant silhouette.”

The Orchid Curve sub-collection is a study of the sensual organic forms and the unique symmetry of an orchid’s petals. The Orchid Curve necklace is a pendant in platinum with an unenhanced sapphire of over 38 carats and diamonds. It is transformable into two looks and can be a diamond necklace with a sapphire pendant and a diamond necklace without a pendant.

Diamond High jewellery is often an investment as well as a piece of art. Pieces like these frequently appear at auction years later with sale prices dwarfing their original purchase price. This can mean that these breathtaking pieces sit in a vault unseen by the world; however Tiffany wants you to wear them. Reynolds says “The ability to wear a design multiple ways—such as our Orchid Curve necklaces from the BOTANICA: Blue Book 2022 collection—adds versatility desirability and of course wearability to these exceptional pieces.”

The rarity and value of the diamonds and the beauty of the design are usually what put one in awe of High jewellery of this caliber. However the complexity of crafting many of the pieces if understood is awe-inspiring on its own. Reynolds explains “The Orchid Curve necklace is one of the most exceptional designs of the BOTANICA: Blue Book 2022 collection. The process of handcrafting it was perhaps the most technically challenging however and the result is an incredibly innovative work of art. This necklace is sculptural with its organic curves and clean folds. As a necklace it needs to have flexibility and movement; it needs to be both beautiful and comfortable. We achieved this by custom-cutting hundreds of diamonds to fit each setting. Each diamond has its own movement and the artisan must conceal the mechanisms that facilitate the organic motion of the diamonds.”

The earrings are set in platinum with pear-shaped diamonds of over 3 total carats and baguette and round brilliant diamonds of over 2 carats.

The designation of “High Jewellery” is reserved for the best of the best in terms of design rarity workmanship and value. The natural origin of diamonds and gemstones is essential for jewellery to have rarity and ever be considered High Jewellery. Reynolds says “Sourcing gemstones for our collections is a quest to find the rarest most beautiful and unusual gemstones in the world. My team and I travel extensively in search of these miracles of nature and every single diamond and colored gemstone is selected by hand. As we searched for the perfect colored gemstone for the Orchid Curve necklace we were fortunate to find a rare unenhanced sapphire of substantial size with exceptional color and clarity. Its beauty cannot be overstated.”"

RALEIGH N.C. (October 10 2022) – 321 Coffee Raleigh’s first coffee shop that employs people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is proud to partner with technology giant Lenovo and Engage NC a non-profit providing venture financing to make the workforce an inclusive space for people with all abilities. As part of this new partnership 321 Coffee will open a fully accessible roasting facility filled with Lenovo technology helping them scale the company’s roasting capacity and enabling them to create new jobs and hire additional staff.

321 Coffee employs more than 40 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. These staff members show up every day excited to work and ready to contribute by roasting coffee taking orders making drinks and interacting with customers.

Currently 321 Coffee has a waiting list of more than 100 people with disabilities who want to work for the company. With the addition of the roasting facility job capacity at 321 will grow to support an estimated 200 new work hours per week for people with disabilities.

“There are many physical barriers that make roasting coffee with standard equipment difficult for our staff – those bags weigh upwards of 30lbs and you typically have to raise them above your head to pour them into the roaster” said Lindsay Wrege co-founder and CEO 321 Coffee. “With the help of our community partners Lenovo and EngageNC 321 Coffee will be able to address this challenge and remove similar barriers through innovative design and technology to make the process more accessible.”

As part of this partnership Lenovo is providing $150000 and EngageNC is providing $50000 to support the build and operation of the roasting facility during its first three years of operation. Lenovo is also providing $15000 worth of technology to make the facility accessible for all 321 staff members.

“At Lenovo our mission is to provide smarter technology for all and we are proud to partner with organizations like 321 Coffee that are committed to fostering a more inclusive community here in Raleigh” said Gerald Youngblood chief marketing officer Lenovo North America. “Technology has the ability to open doors for the future of a more accessible workforce and we are grateful for this opportunity to implement Lenovo technology in a space where it will make a lasting impact.”

This technology partnership will help enable workplace independence so that 321 staff are empowered and confident in performing their job tasks without concern of ability. 321 staff will undergo individualized training on how to use this equipment and accommodations will be made as needed to achieve job independence throughout the various roles.

The additional financial support from EngageNC will help bring these plans to life. EngageNC has been working with 321 Coffee since its early days of operating pop-up coffee shops providing early financing and mentoring.

Bruce Kirschenbaum President of EngageNC said: “Our mission is to create employment opportunities for adults with Autism and other developmental disabilities. When we first heard about the plans of 321 Coffee to employ this population we reached out and were very impressed with the vision and drive of their founders Lindsay Wrege and Michael Evans. Their goals were perfectly aligned with our vision and we wanted to support their business to increase the local job creation for this underserved population”.

To bring more public awareness to this innovative workplace 321 will host tours and workshops at the roasting facility welcoming other companies and individuals inside to showcase this new accessible technology in action and demonstrate how others can be more inclusive in their practices.

321 Coffee plans to start building out the roasting facility in October 2022 as part of National Disability Awareness Month.

Find out more about how we test .

Comparison Products

We’re comparing these two drives against a diverse selection of hard drives including the 6TB WD Black WD6003FZBX a gaming HDD the Seagate IronWolf Pro NAS 8TB Toshiba’s DT01ACA300 at 3TB and the helium-filled 8TB HGST UltraStar He8. These drives as tested are 7200RPM which indicates an average latency of around 4.17ms. We're building out a more diverse set of comparables for future HDD reviews but this selection provides a solid comparison of drives aimed at different types of applications.

Trace Testing - 3DMark Storage Benchmark

Built for gamers 3DMark’s Storage Benchmark focuses on real-world gaming performance. Each round in this benchmark stresses storage based on gaming activities including loading games saving progress installing game files and recording gameplay video streams.

Hard drives are far from ideal for gaming these days — SSDs have become more affordable and they load games far faster. Games are only getting larger and technologies like DirectStorage ensure that future titles could require SSDs for the best performance.

Current-gen consoles already use these technologies and those games will be ported to personal computers (PCs). That is to say the ability to leverage performance characteristics of SSDs rather than HDDs is the way forward for gaming although capacity remains an issue. QLC- and PLC-based drives of the future may alter this equation particularly with the assistance of compression.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Benchmark

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

As we expected Seagate’s 20TB drives are on top here: Functionally the two drives are very similar. HGST’s UltraStar falls behind while the other three contenders perform roughly the same and land in the middle of the pack.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom 50GB dataset. We copy 31227 files of various types such as pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We see HGST’s drive fall behind again. Otherwise ranks correlate to capacity except for the WD Black which holds up well.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / CrystalDiskMark

ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how each device handles different file sizes.

Image 1 of 14 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Here we see results that align with what we saw in DiskBench: the WD Black is hanging with the 20TB drives while the alternatives are slower roughly stratifying along capacity lines. The He8 is again a stand-out — in a bad way — with particularly poor sequential write performance. We can see that HDDs prefer larger block sizes and of course we know they cannot compete with SSDs with smaller I/O especially the random I/O we see in some CrystalDiskMark (CDM) tests.

Of course higher capacity is not always better as we see there with 4KB QD1 random reads that tend to dictate how fast a drive feels in an operating system environment. However the He8 finally shows up for those two tests and the WD Black continues to do well.



However we can see the Exos X20 in particular does well with random writes. Here the drive is better than its IronWolf Pro sibling suggesting the possibility of firmware optimization.

Sustained Write Performance

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most HDDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of volatile memory like DRAM. Sustained write speeds hit the platters directly and tend to be consistent. There are exceptions to both of these statements as there are SSHDs (flash-containing hybrid HDDs) OptiNAND drives and SMR drives that deviate from the traditional configuration. We use Iometer to detect the maximum sustained write speed of the HDD.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

One area HDDs can be consistent is with sustained sequential writes. SSD performance in this space is much more variable. Performance consistency is always valued in non-consumer markets and products are often selected to match anticipated workloads. In this case there’s a general trend towards better write performance with higher capacity although again the WD Black outperforms this expectation while the He8 underperforms. HDDs in the future may be faster here for example by using multiple actuators and there is a trend towards unifying mechanical storage with flash vis-a-vis the NVMe Specification 2.0.

While SSDs rely on SLC caching (native flash in a single-bit pseudo-SLC mode) and have some small write combining in volatile memory hard drives traditionally rely on substantial volatile DRAM to act as a cache to mitigate physical performance pitfalls. As such speaking of cache recovery here is unnecessary particularly given that the cache is small relative to the capacity of the drives.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are important aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly ultimately saving energy.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Efficiency is the name of the game with hyper-scaled systems and here we see that the 20TB Seagate drives deliver on a watts-per-TB of capacity measure pulling less power than some drives with less capacity. The WD Black again matches up but it’s worth considering that it provides less than one-third of the capacity in the same space.



Physical space is often a premium in enterprise and further NAS systems may have a limited number of bays — not to mention that cost can scale with the bay count. There are secondary effects here such as with efficiency and cooling but the idea is that one is considering these drives predominately for their high capacities within a given power footprint.

We use a Rocket Lake platform with most background applications such as indexing windows updates and anti-virus disabled in the OS to reduce run-to-run variability.

Conclusion

If you’re looking for 20TB of capacity in a conventional hard drive these two options from Seagate are spot-on. It will be interesting to see what the competition can do although WD’s OptiNAND will fundamentally operate a bit differently. Ultimately there is more than one way to increase the limits of HDD capacity with various trade-offs to consider with performance a secondary concern. Sometimes you just want a lot of reliable capacity that matches your performance threshold and these drives fit the bill with solid performance and reliability metrics.

While the Exos X20 and IronWolf Pro 20TB are nearly the same drives there are some differences in how they are both tuned and marketed. It’s worth looking at Seagate’s datasheets to determine what you need. We give these drives high marks because they do exactly what they should do — but with the caveat that you’ll be paying a hefty premium to push the limits of capacity. Naturally lower capacity points are more forgiving on a dollar-per-TB basis.

These drives do not seem well-suited for the general consumer since there are smaller drives that perform as well or better at a significantly lower cost per gigabyte. On the other hand those who really need this kind of capacity and reliability in the smallest amount of physical space possible have some solid options.

The cause of the drop is weaker demand from cloud providers inflation the conflict between Ukraine and Russia war and supply chain difficulties says TrendFocus.

One area bucking the trend is nearline (high-capacity) disk drives where capacity is forecast to be flat as fewer high-cap drive shipments are offset by increased capacity per drive.

According to Wells Fargo analyst Aaon Rakers TrendFocus estimates that planned HDD unit volumes in for Q3 and Q4 will be in the region of 35 million which compares to the Q2’s 44.7 million and Q1’s 52.8 million. Total 2022 disk drive unit ships could be 170 million equating to a 34 percent decline on 2021.

TrendForce thinks that demand will start to rise in Q2 of 2023 as cloud buyers use existing inventories however that is subject to imporvements in the overall economy. The analyst also thinks per-drive capacity increases will come from adding platters with 11-platter nearline drives using the existing 10-platter drives’ 0.5mm thick aluminum-based substrates.

A 10-platter conventionally recorded 20TB drive would then become an 11-platter 22TB drive and a 22TB shingled would transition to a 24.2TB drive.

TrendFocus says thinner platters would enable 12-platter drives to be built. How this would play out with high-capacity recording methods such as Western Digital and Toshiba’s MAMR and Seagate’s HAMR is an interesting question. It could mean that less aggressive MAMR/HAMR technology would be needed to reach a capacity point such as 30TB.

A 12-platter version of an existing 10-platter 20TB drive would reach 24TB leaving 6TB to be made up by MAMR or HAMR tech.

The research group suggests Seagate may need to improve HAMR disk drive production quality to reduce scrap rates and increase profitability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmlibS5jb20vMjAyMi0xMC0xMS1EYWxsYXMtRm9ydC1Xb3J0aC1JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLUFpcnBvcnQtQ29udGludWVzLUNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24td2l0aC1Tb3VsLU1hY2hpbmVzLXRvLUltcHJvdmUtdGhlLVRyYXZlbGVycy1FeHBlcmllbmNlLXdpdGgtQUnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dallas Fort Worth International Airport Continues Collaboration with Soul Machines to Improve the Traveler's ...,"SAN FRANCISCO – October 11 2022 – Soul Machines the company pioneering the use of autonomously animated AI-powered customer care solutions to help improve the traveler experience today announced significant progress made at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).

Topics of discussion ranged from updates on market dynamics to supply concerns and the need for critical new investments to establish a cleaner and more secure global energy system. Also at the conference a keynote leadership dialogue was held with Jeffrey Martin chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra who outlined the growing role of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in helping to meet the energy security needs of trading partners in Europe and Asia.

U.S. LNG: security and sustainability

Martin expressed optimism that the U.S. could out-compete global peers in offering lower-emission LNG exports in the coming decades. Current LNG operators including Sempra Infrastructure are already pursuing cleaner technologies such as electric drives carbon capture and hydrogen. Martin also noted that the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act provides further incentives for these investments while advancing the broader policy goal of reducing U.S. emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.

“We think hydrogen certainly will have a big role to play as the LNG space evolves” he said. “As we build new export facilities we are planning ahead with a view toward leveraging common areas in development to allow us to more cost-effectively bring hydrogen into the mix further down the line.”

Additionally Sempra is a founding partner of a methane emissions measurement and tracking initiative called Veritas to certificate emissions. Working with upstream producers to certify feed gas and cargoes as low-emission creates another opportunity for the U.S. to further demonstrate its position as a sustainability leader to countries importing U.S. LNG.

“Innovation and developing new technologies should be framed as a leadership opportunity” said Martin. “Between now and 2030 and in the decades that follow we expect America to compete aggressively to deliver a lower emissions profile across the LNG value chain compared to other international alternatives.”

Green electrons and green molecules

Sempra is the owner of one of the largest energy networks in North America with roughly 300000 miles of transmission and distribution assets. Although Sempra’s operating companies do not produce energy in any significant way the company’s networks deliver energy to more American consumers than any other utility. “In many ways that is why we have such a relentless focus on continuing to decarbonize the energy we deliver” Martin shared.

California which is the 5th largest economy in the world is a prime example of how certain regions are already making significant progress toward a decarbonized future. San Diego Gas & Electric Company owned by Sempra is a recognized leader in providing energy from renewable sources. Also by 2030 California is expected to be well on its way to phasing out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars which would advance the electrification of the transportation sector with the associated build out of charging infrastructure and vehicle-to-grid power systems.

“At Sempra we are going to try to electrify as many aspects of the communities we serve as we can but we also recognize there will be some areas that are hard to electrify like heavy-duty transportation as well as certain commercial and industrial processes” said Martin.

This gap could be served through clean molecules such as green hydrogen. Martin shared with the audience that Sempra’s subsidiary Southern California Gas Company has developed plans to establish a major hydrogen hub to serve the greater Los Angeles region. Today Los Angeles is home to the nation’s largest manufacturing base and two of the busiest container ports in America. Serving manufacturing and heavy-duty trucking needs through cleaner fuel sources is increasingly recognized as a critical success factor in delivering a low carbon future.

Building energy networks for the future

By 2030 Martin expects exports of American LNG will more than double with the principal benefit of reducing the market’s reliance on coal for power production. Combined with an aggressive expansion of renewable power and electric battery storage the global energy mix has the potential to be reformed significantly by the end of the decade.

“It’s exciting to see the United States has made a decision to take an affirmative leadership role in transitioning to a lower carbon and more sustainable society” said Martin. “At Sempra we are committed to doing our part.”

‘Era [Software] is the expert in log management. With this acquisition we are creating something better than the sum of the parts’ says Ben Sigelman co-founder and general manager of Lightstep by ServiceNow.

Digital workflow technology developer ServiceNow’s Lightstep observability business has signed an agreement to acquire Era Software a provider of log management technology that ServiceNow expects to help strengthen its observability capabilities.

Once the acquisition closes Era Software will become part of Lightstep. ServiceNow in 2021 acquired Lightstep a developer of next-generation application monitoring and observability tools used by DevOps engineers to build deploy run and monitor cloud-native applications.

“Lightstep was acquired by ServiceNow last summer” Ben Sigelman co-founder and general manager of Lightstep by ServiceNow told CRN. “And now it’s acquiring Era Software.”

Observability is a way to look at the outputs of an application to understand its internal state and from there look at how to troubleshoot it.

Lightstep is focused on helping enterprises simplify observability Sigelman said.

“Large enterprises are concerned about the number of tools they use and about fragmented and siloed tools” he said. “And log management is very fragmented. Era [Software] is the expert in log management. With this acquisition we are creating something better than the sum of the parts. Lightstep’s long-term vision is to be a unified observability solution.”

Era Software is focused on storing and retrieving logs at scale said Todd Persen co-founder and CEO of Era Software.

“We’re taking that focus we have and putting it together with Lightstep in a unified whole” Persen said.

ServiceNow’s Lightstep business unit has for years been able to ingest log data but customers are really looking for dedicated log management capabilities and its technology was designed cloud-native Sigelman said.

This is important because the amount of log data generated by the cloud is an order of magnitude greater than when done on-premises and Era Software provides Lightstep with a big shortcut to meet customers’ core use cases he said.

“For us to offer that kind of log management on our own would take years” he said. “Lightstep supports log data but doesn’t check all the boxes for management of that data. We plan to build a unified solution up and down the stack.”

Once the acquisition closes the initial goal is to integrate Era Software into Lightstep and be available to Lightstep customers some time next year Persen said.

“Also there are a lot of things Era [Software] hasn’t had the opportunity to do in the past but could do as part of a larger platform” he said. “We have a ton of engineers and with Lightstep can do those things. We really want to build a best-of-breed platform so that observability can do what it was designed to do: make sure humans have less management toil.”

Sigelman declined to discuss the dollar value of the acquisition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYWNjZWxlcmF0aW9uZWNvbm9teS5jb20vY2xvdWQtd2Fycy9zZXJ2aWNlbm93cy1uZXctc3VwZXJzdGFyLXRvcC0yMC1xMi1kZWFscy1hbGwtaW5jbHVkZS1sb3ctY29kZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ServiceNow's New Superstar: Top-20 Q2 Deals All Include Low-Code,"In a striking example of how the low-code revolution is one of the most powerful forces shaping the business-technology landscape today low-code solutions were included in 20 out of 20 of ServiceNow’s largest Q2 deals CEO Bill McDermott said recently.

That anecdote underscores a tectonic shift in which businesses are becoming not only consumers of software made by the tech industry but also creators of their own unique technology to meet the new and digital-first demands of the acceleration economy.

Speaking at a Goldman Sachs investors conference last month McDermott highlighted the inclusion of low-code technology in all of those top Q2 deals as an extension of ServiceNow’s founding principles.

“ServiceNow actually was a low-code platform to begin with” McDermott said during his Q&A session with Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan. “That’s what it was. It just so happened that IT people saw the magic in it and that’s where we made our fastest advancements.

“But it could have easily been in the employee experience the customer service experience or you could have just put it out there as a platform that people could build on. What’s interesting now is all those things have come together at once.

“And if you think about business and you think about digital transformation 80% of the digital transformation efforts out there don’t pay off—and you might ask ‘Why is that?’

“And the answer is integration. One system doesn’t integrate well with another system and ultimately these integration challenges of clunky 20th-century architectures get in the way of a good digital transformation idea.”

Flipping from that complex past into the future McDermott sees low-code technology as an essential component for companies making the transition to digital businesses.

In May we offered this perspective from McDermott in a piece called Bill McDermott’s 10-Step Plan for High-Flying ServiceNow to Reach $15 Billion:

“In the digital-business era differentiation can’t be bought—instead it must be built. IDC has forecasted that 750 million net new applications will be created between 2023 and 2025. With that kind of unprecedented demand for net new innovation together with a global shortage of professional developers low-code application development is a massive market opportunity…. And ultimately this creative workflow is massive because the number of applications that will be developed in the next three years supersedes the number that has been built in the last half-century. And there are not enough engineers in the world to do that and they’re doing that in record numbers on ServiceNow.”

Final Thoughts

So that would equate to somewhere around 650000 new apps being built every single day for the next three years — and by any measure that’s a massive challenge for companies to handle in terms of not only the low-code tech that’s required but also hiring the right type of talent to deliver all those real-time apps and fostering the culture of creation not just consumption.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxlMmUuY29tL25ld3MvZXktYWNxdWlyZXMtc2VydmljZW5vdy1yZWQtbW9radIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ernst & Young (EY) Acquires ServiceNow Workflow Automation Partner Red Moki -,"Ernst & Young Limited has acquired New Zealand-based Red Moki.

Al Sharpton protest regarding Cleveland headquarters construction,"Sherwin-Williams has responded to a protest being held on Tuesday regarding the construction of its new headquarters.

CLEVELAND — Just before Rev. Al Sharpton began to speak at a rally outside of Cleveland City Hall calling for a Black-owned firm to be a key partner in the construction of Sherwin-Williams' global headquarters project on Tuesday the Cleveland-based company released a statement responding to the protest.

“Sherwin-Williams has been meeting with Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb since he was elected. His support of our Company over that time has been and continues to be steadfast"" Sherwin-Williams Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John G. Morikis said in a statement. ""While we received many attractive offers to relocate our new headquarters from several cities nationally Mayor Bibb’s strong leadership and clear vision for Cleveland have only solidified our choice to stay and invest here. Working together with Mayor Bibb and his administration we are focused on the right things we are excited by what we have already accomplished and we are confident that our continued partnership will achieve our shared goals of helping Cleveland the region and Sherwin-Williams thrive for decades to come.""

Sherwin-Williams also noted that it was hosted by the Urban League of Cleveland on Monday ""to provide a joint update on the Building our Future project and the positive impact the project is having on the local community."" Attendees at the event included:

Justin Bibb Cleveland Mayor

Blaine Griffin Cleveland City Council President

Marsha Mockabee President and CEO Urban League of Cleveland

Ron Todd Minority Affairs Liaison to Office of the Ohio State Governor

Pernel Jones Cuyahoga County Council District 8

Shakorie Davis Urban League CAP Program Facilitator

Rev. Dr. Stephen Rowan Cleveland Bethany Baptist Church

Pastor Anthony L. Small Sr. Cleveland Starlight Missionary Baptist Church

Pastor Jimmy L. Gates Sr. Cleveland Zion Hill Baptist Church

Sherwin-Williams also said that its ""deliberate and intentional process of ensuring diverse firms are included in the Building Our Future project"" has resulted in $122 million in contracts to diverse firms with a commitment that is expected to exceed $180 million and engagement with 57 diverse firms on the project to date.

""It is unfortunate that some are using their personal agendas and animosities to drive a false narrative and cloud the positive impact the Building Our Future project is making on the Cleveland community now and for years to come"" the company said.

According to a flyer for Tuesday's protest the rally aimed to ""urge the Mayor and the City Council to show the public where taxpayer dollars are being spent on the construction of The Sherwin-Williams Company's new global headquarters. Black-owned firm should be named key partner with major managerial responsibilities and higher earning potential.""

Sherwin-Williams has broken ground on both their new downtown Cleveland headquarters and the Brecksville research and development center. Both facilities are slated to be completed in late 2024.

The Urban League of Greater Cleveland says it plans to continue its partnership with Sherwin-Williams.

“There are three criteria that we consider when engaging in public-private partnerships” said Marsha A. Mockabee President and Chief Executive Officer of the Urban League of Greater Cleveland in a statement. “There must be an authentic commitment to diversity and inclusion a demonstrated accountability to achieving the metrics and the willingness to develop long-term strategies that empower communities and change lives. The Urban League is pleased to partner with Sherwin-Williams to bring its community impact commitment to fruition.”

3News sat down with Mockabee who added that while she understands aspirational goals there are certain processes and policies that should go in place first.

""You first have to create policy because without policy there's no teeth to hold people accountable so that's the first step"" Mockabee said. ""I think the second step is you have to make sure that there is a pipeline of the kind of talent that you're talking about that you want in those positions and that's what the Urban League is doing in helping Sherwin-Williams with their commitment.""

Mockabee said developing policy can allow people in the African American community to benefit from contracts and the ""opportunities to work and grow and develop wealth.""

She added that conversations with civil rights colleagues and with partners involved in the project have informed the Urban League's decision to stay aligned with local leadership and work with Sherwin-Williams.

""Our job the Urban League is we feel to extend the benefit from that building into our communities in ways that even Sherwin-Williams doesn't necessarily see immediately"" she said. ""So we're that sort of broker in between to help Sherwin-Williams see how they can bring benefit into the communities and the communities can benefit from them staying here as a headquartered organization.""

The headquarters campus will consist of three buildings: a two-story pavilion acting as the front porch to Public Square a 36-floor office tower and an attached multi-level parking garage.

Once completed more than 3000 Sherwin-Williams employees will move into the new headquarters.

They’re calling on the company to name a Black contractor as a key partner in the project.

“No more Sherwin Williams. No more"" protestors chanted.

Black contractors and community leaders called on Mayor Justin Bibb and City Council to withhold tax dollars set aside for Sherwin William’s $600 million project. The company has awarded $122 million in contracts to minority firms but has not named a Black-owned firm as a key partner.

The rally featured civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton who founded the New York-based National Action Network.

“We are the children of Dr. King demanding economic justice"" Sharpton said.

Sharpton said the project should benefit the entire community.

""If you invest tax dollars from the public then the whole public ought to benefit from the investment"" Sharpton said.

Abigail Bottar / Ideastream Public Media Norm Edwards has been leading the effort to have Sherwin Williams name a Black contractor as a key partner.

Norm Edwards leads the Black Contractors Group (BCG) of Cleveland. Talks stalled between his group and Sherwin Williams he said and he said the company has refused to come back to the table. Edwards said the contracts Sherwin Williams have awarded to minority firms are not enough.

“We want a Black partner in there. They’re going to hire Black contractors. They’re going to hire Black workers"" Edwards said. ""They’re not giving us the opportunity because we don’t count. And we deserve better we demand better and we’re going to get better.”

Along with BCG the Cleveland Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) has been involved in talks with Sherwin Williams. Charles Steele Jr. president and CEO of the national branch of SCLC said he has been to Cleveland numerous time for protests and attempts to talk with the company.

Abigail Bottar / Ideastream Public Media Charles Steele Jr. is the president and CEO of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He's been to Cleveland numerous times to try to talk to Sherwin Williams.

""I never had a president or CEO of any organization or institution like Sherwin Williams to deny me a meeting"" Steele said. ""Never had it done.""

Protesters threatened to stop the construction project and to boycott Sherwin Williams but no clear plan was confirmed.

""On any job that has public tax dollars if we are not at the table it's not going to get built"" Edwards said.

In a statement Sherwin Williams said the company is working with 57 minority-owned woman-owned and small business firms and expect to work with more. The new global headquarters is part of the company's Building Our Future project which Sherwin Williams said aims to drive inclusion and equity for underrepresented groups.

Recently Sherwin Williams partnered with the Urban League of Greater Cleveland to launch a Construction Accelerator Program which will support minority businesses in construction. The company has also partnered with members of Cleveland's interdenominational clergy to offer the HomeWork program in underserved areas in the city. The program trains participants to begin careers as professional painters and 70% of HomeWork graduates are employed as professional painters.

""It is unfortunate that some are using their personal agendas and animosities to drive a false narrative and cloud the positive impact the Building Our Future project is making on the Cleveland Community now and for years to come"" the statement said.

In a statement Mayor Bibb said he’s working to create inclusive economic opportunities for all residents.

""We have engaged partners throughout the city to ensure that equity is at the forefront of broad economic growth"" the statement said. ""For too long minority contractors have been left out of opportunities in our city. It is our responsibility to change that.""

Bibb said he met with Sharpton last week and provided him with an update on the project. The headquarters are expected to open by the end of 2024.

But the merger is less of a takeover and more of a partnership according to leaders of both firms who framed the deal Tuesday as mutually beneficial.

“We have been impressed with Jamestown’s combination of sector expertise dedication to driving creative placemaking and reputation in the fund management business” David Simon chairman president and CEO of Simon Property Group said in a statement. “Their strong leadership team and track record align with our focus on investing in best-in-class partners. Jamestown is well positioned for future growth.”

Jamestown will continue to operate independently under the leadership of CEO Matt Bronfman and President Michael Phillips according to a joint press release while Christoph Kahl will transition to Jamestown’s board of directors for daily involvement in that company’s operations.

“At Jamestown our goal is to be the best mixed-use investor globally focusing on creating innovation hubs and community centers” Phillips said in a statement. “The partnership with Simon will help us achieve that goal and position us for our next chapter as we scale our differentiated products in an increasingly global world.”

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but it is expected to close near the end of the quarter according to Simon Property Group.

Jamestown has $13 billion in assets under management. Its investments such as One Times Square Chelsea Market and Industry City in New York City Ponce City Market in Atlanta and Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco are expected to diversify Simon’s mall-centric portfolio.

Simon Property Group’s (SPG) stock price seems to have had a reaction to the news having risen 0.82 percent between when the markets opened and 11:09 a.m. Eastern Time. But the price per share is still down 29 percent compared to this time last year.

The Indianapolis-based real estate investment trust is among a number of U.S. retail property owners adding new types of tenants such as hospitality office multifamily and coworking firms to unused space at their malls in large surface parking lots vacant anchor stores and other sites. The additions aim to help revitalize and increase foot traffic at existing stores as brick-and-mortar retailers compete with online shopping which has accelerated in the pandemic.

Simon said on Tuesday its strategic deal with Jamestown a global firm headquartered in Atlanta will enable it to accelerate its ""future densification projects.""

Jamestown which describes itself as a design-focused real estate investment and management company has been involved in landmark projects such as Chelsea Market in New York City; Industry City in Brooklyn New York; Ponce City Market in Atlanta where it has its headquarters; Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco; and the Innovation and Design Building in Boston.

Upon closing Simon plans to acquire a 50% interest in Jamestown from founding partners Christoph and Ute Kahl who will continue to be Jamestown shareholders. Simon and Jamestown didn't disclose further terms of their deal which is expected to close before the end of the year.

Jamestown began in 1983 in Atlanta and in Cologne Germany home to co-founder and Chairman Christoph Kahl. Once the deal is complete Jamestown plans to operate independently and continue to be led by CEO Matt Bronfman and President Michael Phillips who will retain their existing ownership. Christoph is set to transition from day-to-day involvement as the company's chairman to a member of the new Jamestown board.

Capitalizing on Assets

""The partnership will unlock new value-creation opportunities and create a platform for future growth in the investment management sector"" Simon and Jamestown said in a joint statement. ""With Simon Jamestown will gain a partner with a deep platform of resources and operational tools that will enhance the firm's ability to scale and grow. With Jamestown Simon will gain an opportunity to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses with an experienced fund manager and mixed-use operator and developer.""

Simon's pending transaction with Jamestown will fortify the mall owner's foothold in Atlanta’s ritzy Buckhead shopping district where it already owns the Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square malls.

Jamestown’s Buckhead Village District is one of the city’s highest-end retail centers and at times competed directly with Simon for tenants.

A redevelopment and densification at Phipps Plaza was already undertaken by Simon involving the completed or in-process addition of a Nobu hotel and restaurant a 340000-square-foot office building a Life Time fitness facility as well as one of its coworking sites Life Time Work.

And Simon's strategic partnership in Jamestown will help in those kinds of endeavors according to analysts and company officials.

""The deal helps Simon diversify away from its traditional focus on shopping centers"" Neil Saunders a managing director of GlobalData said in an email to CoStar News. ""This is sensible from both a financial and market perspective as the center of gravity has shifted away from old-style malls to more mixed-use-style schemes which integrate residential and space for innovative businesses. Jamestown has expertise in creating destinations and this expertise will be valuable to Simon including as it tries to reinvent some of its own properties.""

Since its founding Jamestown has invested in and managed real estate on behalf of nearly 80000 entities. It has created and overseen more than 30 funds that own or have owned landmark properties such as One Times Square site of New York City's New Year's Eve ball drop and Chelsea Market the mixed-use project on Manhattan's West Side that it sold in 2018 to Google for $2.4 billion.

Admiring Jamestown’s Placemaking

David Simon president and chairman of Simon in the statement pointed to ""Jamestown's combination of sector expertise dedication to driving creative placemaking and reputation in the fund management business.""

Jamestown initially invested in trophy towers and at one time owned 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York. All told it has executed transactions totaling $40 billion.

The firm has started the transformation of Chelsea Market into a community hub where office tenants mingle with shoppers diners and tourists in the food hall and retail corridor.

Jamestown followed a similar playbook in 2011 in its hometown when Jamestown acquired a former 2.1 million-square-foot Sears warehouse and distribution center in midtown Atlanta and converted it into Ponce City Market one of Atlanta’s liveliest live-work-play developments.

""At Jamestown our goal is to be the best mixed-use investor globally focusing on creating innovation hubs and community centers"" Michael Phillips the company's president said in the statement.

He added that ""the partnership with Simon will help us achieve that goal and position us for our next chapter as we scale our differentiated products in an increasingly global world.""

The fast-fashion retailer will open 14 new stores across the country including a new location at the Gran Plaza Outlets in Calexico Calif. which opened in August 2022. The Calexico store is the first in a series of Forever 21 openings scheduled to roll out across America through June 2023. (See complete list of the upcoming new stores at end of article.)

“We’re seeing even more consumers returning to the in-store shopping experience” said Winnie Park who took the reins as CEO of Forever 21 in January. “While our online business remains strong and a key component of our growth strategy we love interacting with our consumers in-store.""

Forever 21 said it will celebrate the grand opening of each location with special events and special promotions including gift card giveaways gifts with purchase and food and beverages. The new stores will also be decorated with a variety of photo-op moments to help customers share the celebrations and their in-store experience via social media the company said.

“Consumers are once again enjoying the benefits of shopping in-store and are purchasing for a range of activities such as expanded social events or a wardrobe refresh as they return to the office” said Jacob Hawkins Forever 21 chief marketing digital and omni officer. “We’re also seeing even more customers choosing the buy online pick up in-store option and these 14 new stores reflect our commitment to ensuring we have the local inventory to meet demand for this increasingly popular omni shopping model.”

Forever 21 declared bankruptcy in 2019 and was subsequently acquired by Authentic Brands Group in a deal that also included Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners. (JCPenney declared bankruptcy in May 2020 and its retail operations were acquired in November 2020 by Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.)

The store expansion follows Forever 21's announcement in December that it would sell a curated mix fashions at 100 J.C. Penney stores and on the retailer's website.

Latin coffee brand Café Bustelo is ramping up its use of music and 3D animation to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with a character called Lina inspired by the wife of founder Gregorio Bustelo.

Two new spots from the Publicis agency focus on two passion points of the brand’s culture: arts and music.

In this spot titled “Salon” Lina sings the song “Honey”—declaring in Spanish “My flavor is one of a kind If you know how to play”—accompanied by other brightly colored animated characters getting hair and nail treatments.

“Each frame on its own feels like a nice piece of art that you could hang on the wall” Café Bustelo senior brand manager Edwardo Merino tells Marketing Daily.

In “Music Car” Lina sings the same song but from the back of a vehicle overflowing with speakers.

Argentine singer Mia Matahoney provides the voice of Lina.

Roughly 50% of households that purchase Café Bustelo are populated by people of Hispanic origin according to Merino. “Everything we design—from advertising to new product development—has to have that Hispanic/Latin angle.”

Café Bustelo considers itself a “can-centric” brand because of the way people have repurposed the red and yellow container with a triangular logo bearing the likeness of Angelina Bustelo—hence the character Lina according to Merino.

“We knew it way before social media but now through social listening we see that consumers use the can like a plant pot. When we go to Etsy we see people getting creative with uses of the cans.”

Likewise Andres Rivera the lead designer and illustrator of the new ads “used empty Café Bustelo cans to store his toys while growing up” adds Merino.

The idea was developed from PSOne Publicis Groupe’s Power of One agency solution for The J.M. Smucker Company.",,,,,,,,,
SNA,Snap-on,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vaXRzZm9zcy5jb20vaW5zdGFsbC1zbmFwLWFyY2gtbGludXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Enable Snap Support in Arch Linux,"Snap is a universal package format designed by Canonical the parent company of Ubuntu. Some people do not like Snap but it has some advantages.

Often some applications are only available in the Snap format. This gives you a good enough reason to enable snap in Arch Linux.

I know that AUR has a vast collection of applications but the snap apps often come directly from the developers.

If you want to be able to install Snap applications in Arch Linux you need to enable snap support first.

There are two ways to do it:

Enable Snap support using an AUR helper (easier)

Enable Snap support manually by getting the packages from AUR

Let’s see how to do it.

Method 1. Use an AUR helper to enable Snap

Snap is available in the Arch User Repository as the snapd package. You can install it easily using an AUR helper.

There are many AUR helpers out there but yay is what I prefer because it has syntax similar to the pacman command.

If you don’t have an AUR installed already install Yay using the command below (needs git beforehand):

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay cd yay makepkg -si

Installing yay

Now that yay is installed you can install snapd by:

yay -Sy snapd

Installing snapd from AUR using yay

Yay enables automatic updating of snapd whenever you update your Arch Linux system.

Verify that snap works

To test if snap works fine install and run the hello-world snap package.

sudo snap install hello-world hello-world (or) sudo snap run hello-world

The hello-world snap package executes

If it runs fine then you can install other snap packages easily.

Method 2. Manually build the snap package from AUR

If you do not want to use an AUR helper you can still get the snapd from the AUR. Let me show the detailed procedure.

You will need to install some build tools first.

sudo pacman -Sy git go go-tools python-docutils

Installing Dependencies for snap

Once you’re done with installing the dependencies now you can clone the AUR directory which goes as:

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd cd snapd

Cloning the repository

Then make the snapd package:

makepkg -si

Enter yes when it asks to install other dependency packages.

Making the snap package

You have installed the snapd daemon. However it needs to be enabled to auto start at boot time.

sudo systemctl enable snapd --now sudo systemctl enable snapd.apparmor --now #start snap applications sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap #optional: classic snap support

Enable Snap at startup

The major disadvantage of manually building a package is that you have to manually build every time a new update kicks in. Using an AUR helper solves that problem for us.

Conclusion

I prefer pacman and AUR in Arch Linux. It’s rare to see an application that is not in AUR but available in some other formats. Still using snap could be advantageous in some conditions where you want it directly from the source like installing Spotify on Arch for example.

When Daniel Jones sprained his ankle and Tyrod Taylor suffered a concussion in Week 4 against the Bears the Giants found themselves without a quarterback. Running back Saquon Barkley had to come in and receive several shotgun snaps just to keep the offense functioning before Jones returned to his traditional place on the field his mobility and his options severely limited.

Necessity and invention have a maternal relationship even in football and while some concepts take weeks months even years of polishing and grinding through film before they come together others are born in a flash of desperation.

Those few plays with Barkley seemed to get the Giants' coaches thinking. If they could snap the ball directly to their best player when they had no other options why couldn’t they do it when they did?

“I feel like the ball is in my hand and I can make the right decision” Barkley said Sunday of the simplicity of the plays in which the middle-man quarterback is eliminated from the transaction. “Just go for the keys and go through my rules and just play the game.”

Welcome to the latest wrinkle in the Giants’ playbook:

The WildQuon.

It’s not entirely new. The Giants ran a direct snap to Barkley once before Jones’ injury. In the first quarter of the Week 2 game against Carolina they called it on first-and-goal from the 5. Barkley gained 3 yards.

Since Jones limped off the field though (and perhaps more significantly since Taylor left with his the concussion) it has become something of a staple.

It was used three times to close out the game against the Bears for a total of 18 rushing yards 14 of them on two handoffs from Barkley to Matt Breida. Against the Packers the Giants used it three times for 45 yards and a touchdown. Barkley went for 40 on their first attempt at it Sunday and then scored the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter on a 2-yard run with backfield wingman Gary Brightwell leading the way.

“I kind of just tried to make a play to be honest” Barkley said of the touchdown and his options to run up the middle or outside. “I knew what we were doing and once I saw GB go out I knew it was only a corner there. GB is making a block and it's a foot race and I guessed right.”

The Giants have averaged 10.5 yards per play over the last two games in which the ball was snapped directly to Barkley. In those two full games the Giants are averaging 5.3 yards on the plays in which the quarterback receives the ball. It’s a very small sample size and probably won’t stay that way over a longer period of time or with more application but the direct snaps to Barkley are so far twice as effective as all the other offensive snaps combined.

It’s also significant the snaps to Barkley don’t necessarily wind up with Barkley running. Three of the six in the last two weeks have been handoffs to Breida. Some Barkley runs are up the middle others to the outside. There might even be a pass option out of it at some point.

“We feel like we can find a way to make some plays in that situation” Barkley said. “It's a different run and it's a different type of scheme where we dress up in a different way to get it going. Obviously the Packers came out with the mindset to try to stop the run and that’s probably what every team is going to do from now on. We've just got to continue to adjust.”

The Giants came upon this adjustment thanks to a stumble. It’s only helped steady their stride.

Notes & quotes: Rookie defensive lineman D.J. Davidson was placed on season-ending injured reserve with a torn ACL suffered on Sunday. The fifth-round selection was injured on a Packers punt in the third quarter of the game in London and was carted off the field. He is the third Giants draft choice to tear his ACL this season following offensive tackle Marcus McKethan (fifth round) and linebacker Darrian Beavers (sixth). The Giants did not make a corresponding move to replace Davidson on the active roster but undrafted rookie Ryder Anderson in on the practice squad along with Henry Mondeaux who appeared in two games this season but is dealing with an ankle injury.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0LzY0MTg1NDUvZGF2aWQtYmVja2hhbS1tYW4tdXRkLXRocm93YmFjay1waWMtcm9uYWxkby_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC82NDE4NTQ1L2RhdmlkLWJlY2toYW0tbWFuLXV0ZC10aHJvd2JhY2stcGljLXJvbmFsZG8vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Beckham shares incredible throwback snap of unrecognisable Man Utd star as a kid long before his Old...,"GLAD HAIR DAY David Beckham shares incredible throwback snap of unrecognisable Man Utd star as a kid long before his Old Trafford days

DAVID BECKHAM'S locks have chopped and changed over the years - but he's always been able to spot an hair-apparent.

The England legend has posted a throwback snap of a curly-haired kid whose own career has since weaved magic.

Even then the lad had a look of quiet belief that's been the hallmark of his days at Manchester United and beyond.

Fans might be surprised at how willowy the star appeared to be.

But he had a hunger that seemed to burn deep in his eyes.

Like Becks he's now something of a fashion figure.

And he too has varied his hairstyle but never his dedication.

Some supporters will recognise that focus on his face.

He's also one of the few players that 115-cap midfielder Beckham looked up to on the pitch.

But now back at Old Trafford he could get a parting - after a fringe role this season.

But Becks uncovered the photo on Instagram to help salute the striker's latest astonishing milestone.

And although the schoolboy snap might have been a mystery for some his record shows there's no puzzle over why he's regarded as a GOAT.

Ex-Sporting Lisbon starlet Cristiano Ronaldo (yes it's him) has been mainly a sub under Erik ten Hag.

But the Portugal hero 37 came off the bench on Sunday to hit his 700th club goal.

That helped the Red Devils sink Everton 2-1 at Goodison Park and go fifth.

And perhaps Becks' old pic of Ron on Instagram was another hint the Inter Miami owner wants to take him into the MLS.

The athlete shared a snap that showed him and his rumored new girlfriend Nicolette Dellanno posing together at a restaurant alongside his teammate Braxton Berrios and his partner Sophia Culpo in honor of Berrios' 27th birthday.

His post was soon flooded with a series of comments from online users who told him his new woman was 'too young' for him seemingly referring to the rumors that he had a romantic entanglement with one of his mom Lisa's friends. He is seen with his mom

In the pic the foursome all smiled from ear to ear around a table full of food as Wilson put his arm around Dellanno.

'Happy birthday to my guy!' he captioned it.

People quickly flooded the comment section with reminders of Gile's accusation with one writing 'She's too young Zach.'

'Way too young' agreed someone else while a third person asked 'Why isn't she at least 40?'

Some people even urged Zach to make a move on model Gisele Bündchen 42 who is reportedly speaking with divorce lawyers amid her rumored split from husband Tom Brady.

Soon after reports emerged on the web that she and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Brady 45 were ending their marriage a tweet made its way around social media which showed Wilson flirting with Bündchen - however it has now been debunked as fake.

'Don't worry Giselle I got you' Wilson had appeared to write in the tweet. But according to TheFocus.news he never actually posted it at all and it was photoshopped - but that didn't stop people from talking about it on his recent post.

Wilson and Dellanno have been linked since June - as they were photographed enjoying a Yankees game together at the time.

Their baseball date came just one month before Gile made the shocking allegation that Wilson had cheated on her with someone much older while hitting back at critics who had slammed her for moving on from the Jets player with his one of his friends.

Gile and Wilson split in January and she has reportedly since started dating the NFL star's roommate from college - Washington Commanders wide receiver Dax Milne.

But when Milne shared a photo of him and Gile together and someone branded her a 'homie hopper' in the comment section she fired back: '[Wilson] was sleeping with his mom's best friend... that's the real homie hopper.'

Gile did not share any further details or share his mom's friend's name; however another person appeared to back up her claims replying: 'Lol it's true. I know the best friend's mom and she freaked out about it for a while.'

Two weeks later when asked about Gile's allegation during a press conference the pro footballer dodged the question and said he wanted to focus on the sport instead.

When asked how he was doing after 'all the social media stuff that he's had to deal with' Wilson responded: 'Right... It's just focusing on football and that's really all I can do. It is what it is.

'I'm excited to be here with the boys... I'm excited to just try and get better every single day. That's all I've been focusing on.'

While Wilson stayed quiet about the scandal the Jets' assistant equipment manager Joe McMahon slammed Milne in a comment posted under the Instagram photos of him and Gile writing: 'Idk what's going to be the bigger joke this relationship or your NFL career.'

The exact reasons for Wilson and Gile's split in January was not made public by either party however the pair did scrub each other from their respective social media accounts. Since then Gile has removed her entire Instagram account.

According to a 2021 New York Post feature she and Wilson first began dating in high school.

Wilson's current girlfriend is an influencer who boasts over 250000 followers on TikTok and 41000 on Instagram

In a now-deleted tribute for his 20th birthday she gushed: 'He's the most selfless kind hardworking person I know. I'm the luckiest girl in the world and I have no idea what I did to deserve him.'

Wilson grew up in Draper Utah as one of his parents' six children. His father Mike played college ball for the University of Utah in the 1990s.

Wilson attended the Church of Latter Day Saints-sponsored Brigham Young University where he played for their football team the Cougars.

In a 2021 interview he told Deseret News 'I consider myself a really spiritual person' and 'I feel like I have always had a good relationship with God in my life.' He also said his time at BYU 'helped strengthen his relationship with God.'

As for Gile she is currently a student at Utah Valley University in Orem where she is a member of the school's dance troupe.

Though not an LDS-sponsored school the university offers an extensive Mormon studies curriculum and boasts 'the largest LDS Institute program in the world' according to its website.

Wilson suffered through a poor debut season for the Jets in 2021 with just three wins in 13 appearances throwing for only nine touchdowns in the process. His contract is worth $35 million per year.

In June he told the Post: 'I really do have a lot of confidence in myself. Obviously I think I can be one of the best and I think if anybody doesn't say that then they're not a true competitor.'

It turns out the rumors that he had slept with one of his mom's friends wasn't the isn't the first time that she made her way into headlines.

In the past few years Lisa Neeleman Wilson - who works as a personal trainer and has a burgeoning clothing line in the works - has posted rants on Instagram against mask mandates promoted Hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure and supported ex-President Donald Trump - earning her some attention.

In July 2021 she was even forced to deny rumors that she had an OnlyFans account stating: 'I don't have an OnlyFans account and I have no idea what it is. So if my name is one one it's fake. Some people need to get a life.'

On the day of the allegations about her son she posted a lengthy video in which she talked about how important it was to keep children away from social media.

She said in the clip: 'Satan has found a way to come right into your home and steal your child without you even noticing. The worst part? You let in and you even paid him to do it.'"

All of these found expression in the South and especially in Atlanta.

The history of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States has gained a certain cachet with organizers and policymakers. Divestment  pioneered and popularized by liberation activists to weaken the South African apartheid regime is now being applied to climate change and Israel. The South frequently gets left out of this history — yet in Georgia and elsewhere below the Mason-Dixon line anti-apartheid activism was a vital issue.

In 1985 Atlanta Georgia was one of the nerve centers of opposition to apartheid South Africa in the United States. The branch of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was coordinating a national boycott against Coca-Cola  led by Thandi Gcabashe the daughter of African National Congress (ANC) leader Albert Luthuli. Activists in the city and at Georgia’s universities were fighting for divestment while the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was working with mine unions to picket investor meetings. And progressive civil rights leaders like Georgia state legislator Julian Bond the founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee were locking horns over divestment with moderate counterparts like Andrew Young the mayor of Atlanta.

The Struggle in the South

The American South figures into some of the earliest episodes of anti-apartheid sentiment in the United States. In the mid-1950s when South Africa was unfamiliar to many Americans Martin Luther King Jr expressed admiration for the leader of the ANC Luthuli. By 1962 King endorsed a full boycott of South Africa and continued to speak out until his assassination in 1968. Members of the American Committee on Africa discussed Atlanta as a possible site to jump-start organizing in the South. Still organizing remained scattered and small scale.

That began to change in the 1970s when events like the 1976 Soweto uprising dispelled the myth that black South Africans accepted apartheid and starkly revealed the system’s brute violence. In Atlanta opposition to apartheid sprouted in several different places but it invariably converged around the issue of US businesses in South Africa. Faith-based activism came from the SCLC: it coordinated protests against the sale of South African krugerrands and with the United Mine Workers against the Southern Company importation of South African coal.

The AFSC had an office in Atlanta and it too assumed a leadership position in coordinating among different groups to support sanctions and boycotts. The participation of South African exiles like Gcabashe who led the office’s South Africa program gave the program dedicated and experienced leadership. It achieved fame nationally for launching a boycott of Coca-Cola Atlanta’s most well-known corporation. The Atlanta office also helped support AFSC’s “Peace Tours” — educational speaking tours that informed audiences about the connections between US militarism and the arms industry. The sojourns frequently covered the South in part because of the number of weapons manufacturers in the region.

But the central fight for anti-apartheid activists was over divestment and sanctions. Targeting individual companies was too slow and boycotts of South African goods while powerfully symbolic did little to damage the South African economy writ large. Convincing churches universities and public pension funds to divest from South African companies became one of the central campaigns for apartheid opponents. The fight was led by the Georgia Coalition for Divestment in South Africa and supported politically by Bond.

While conservatives around the United States opposed divestment and generally supported maintaining ties with South Africa in Atlanta disagreement over apartheid exposed divisions between veterans of the civil rights movement. Atlanta mayor Young who had been elected in 1981 and previously served as Jimmy Carter’s ambassador to the United Nations was strikingly moderate and deeply anti-communist.

Young opposed apartheid but did so from the perspective that the vicious system was driving South African toward Marxism. He saw US businesses as a force for good in South Africa. Under Carter Young had shared his fellow Georgian’s preference for enlisting multinational corporations to engage in charity in lieu of fighting for sanctions; he opposed them even in the wake of the Soweto uprising and the 1977 murder of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. In doing so Young drew on his own lessons from the civil rights movement — namely that winning over whites was key and had to be carried out cautiously.

As mayor Young supported divestment but always from the assumption that continuing to invest in South Africa was bad business. His preference was for symbolic action such as prohibiting South African Airways from using Atlanta’s airport; he continued to express support for voluntary corporate action and believed that South Africa’s business community was the best agent to end apartheid. Atlanta’s city council was the major driver behind the divestment of the city’s pension fund; Young played a hands-off role.

Bond’s approach was different. He used his office to fight for state-level divestment and lobbied Georgia’s Republican senator Mack Mattingly to vote for sanctions. Bond succeeded in the latter — Mattingly voted to override Ronald Reagan’s veto of the 1986 Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act — but was less successful in the statehouse. Despite putting up bills every year Bond never got his desired state-level divestment.

One likely reason was Coca-Cola. The powerful company kept the divestment campaign at bay by making African American businessman Carl Ware an executive vice president at the company its strategist and public face on South Africa. Ware played hardball going so far as to contact public institutions about employees who were speaking out on the issue. Gloria Gaines one of the cochairs of the Georgia Coalition for Divestment recalled that Ware reached out to her bosses at the Atlanta transit authority about her activity. Coca-Cola’s influence was so pervasive that SCLC prohibited its staffers from attending anti-Coke rallies.

By the mid-1980s Coke decided to announce a watered-down divestment solution: they agreed to sell their bottling operations in South Africa to black investors. Young and the city’s newspapers publicly applauded the decision but activists noted that Coca-Cola retained the right to sell syrup to the new bottling operations leaving them with the exact same market share. As AFSC and the Georgia Coalition maintained their boycott Coca-Cola continued to escalate its PR campaign — even persuading leading South African figures like Desmond Tutu to serve on the board of an “equal opportunity fund” to burnish company credentials.

The movement had made deep inroads and apartheid would fall less than a decade later with Nelson Mandela’s election. But Coke that all-American company showed how to resist demands for change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcmljdG9kYXkuNmFtY2l0eS5jb20vaGlzdG9yeS1jb29raWUtZmFjdG9yeS10b3dlci1yaWNobW9uZC12YdIBT2h0dHBzOi8vcmljdG9kYXkuNmFtY2l0eS5jb20vaGlzdG9yeS1jb29raWUtZmFjdG9yeS10b3dlci1yaWNobW9uZC12YT9fYW1wPXRydWU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The history of the cookie factory tower in Richmond VA,"The promise of fresh cookies + crackers still looms over West Broad Street near Scott’s Addition but the old Southern Biscuit Company plant has had cold ovens since 2006.

Built in 1927 the tower began producing baked goods out of its main building — six stories of reinforced concrete. The company expanded the plant four times over the next few decades.

Around the 1930s Southern Biscuit Company changed its branding to Famous Foods of Virginia and added a distinctive sign and water tower which still sit atop the building.

Inside the factory were two rotating rack ovens that were two stories high. Cookies baked as they rotated along circular racks winding through the oven to ensure an even bake.

The factory was well-known for its production of Girl Scout Cookies. Southern Biscuit Company became the first officially licensed baker for the scouts in 1939.

A few more mergers saw Southern Biscuit become part of George Weston Ltd. in 1946 + adopt the Interbake Foods name in 1967.

When Interbake moved its headquarters to a new facility in Front Royal in 2006 the Richmond factory closed. Most of the building was emptied during the move but the enormous ovens remained. The building was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register as well as the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

Now the iconic part of Richmond’s industrial skyline is home to the Cookie Factory Lofts an apartment complex. A developer bought the building in 2013 after years of vacancy.

The 150-year-old company which is based in the south of France and owned by the cookware company Emile Henry established a U.S. subsidiary roughly four years ago (it was previously distributed by Mottahedeh). Its American team which consists of Laurent Berp vice president of Jars USA; Patrick Lobo director of sales; Tara Steffen director of marketing; and Eric Jones director of hospitality is poised to share with American buyers its rich heritage artistic vision and sustainable credentials.

“It’s the perfect opportunity to present our full showcase of ceramics to the U.S. market” said Steffen.

Jars is introducing a range of dinnerware bowls and platters — with vases and other decorative pieces to come —to an American audience. Its biggest channel of distribution is independent specialty stores according to Steffen. It also currently has a special line with Williams Sonoma is carried at Bloomingdale’s and is popular with many Michelin chefs worldwide she added.

Steffen highlighted the company’s earth-friendly initiatives: it limits waste materials wherever possible. For example excess or broken raw materials are re-used and excess water used during the glazing process or to clean tools is recycled (the company has its own water treatment plant.) And all of its raw materials are sourced from certified quarries in France and Germany. What’s more “it’s truly handcrafted” Steffan said. “The average piece is touched 21 times by humans.”

Its best-selling dinnerware collection is Tourron which blends beautiful glazes in a mix and match color scheme. One of its most organic collections is Wabi artisan stoneware that features organic shapes and contrasting glazes. And two of its most coveted lines are Vuelta and Plume according to Steffen. Each makes use of contemporary lines and iridescent glazes.

New at this market are Cantine a modern interpretation of classic 1950’s dinnerware in the warm palette of the French Riviera. Also new is Dashi a range of bowls in irregular unique shapes and ash enamels.

All items will be showcased in the company’s 16th floor showroom at 41 Madison Avenue. Steffen said the company is taking a unique approach to its showroom design where it will demonstrate the steps of the manufacturing process from initial design to the casting and glazing process. “It’s a very cool concept” she said. “It will bring our brand vision to life.”"

Rodríguez also explained that the Costa Rican Institute of Tourism believes the country is on the right path to recovering the number of visitors it received pre-pandemic. The institution’s goal is to equal this number by 2023.

According to the Minister airlines will play a huge part in achieving this goal. He mentioned that they must increase the number of flights to the country.

DALLAS Texas -- One woman proved that it is never too late to return to something you love. After staying home to raise her kids Tamaron Nicklas accomplished her dream of being a pilot for Southwest Airlines after two decades out of the sky.

Nicklas talked to GMA3 on stepping away from her Air Force career and the steps she took to get back in the air after 20 years.

""I was in the Air Force for about seven and a half years. We were able to refuel all sorts of different types of aircraft"" Nicklas said. ""We went through Hawaii to Guam got to fly to Australia the Philippines Korea.""

When Nicklas began to start a family it became more of a challenge for her to work.

""I worked really hard to get back into flying. I found out I was pregnant with our third and at that point I just thought I don't think I can do this"" Nicklas said. ""I really actually struggled with it for a while after I'd walked away just in that you know that it's your identity.""

Things started to take a turn for Nicklas when she came across an opportunity to get back in the air.

""I saw in our grad magazine an article about the Air Force's initial flight training down in Pueblo and it just seemed like a really neat way for me to get back into flying and instructing"" Nicklas said."" Nicklas said.

After spending time with her young grandchildren a goal became very clear to Nicklas. She wanted to fly with her husband on Southwest Airlines.

""I asked myself a lot of times why am I doing this? How badly did I want it?I decided yes you know I really want to do this and it was worth the hard work"" Nicklas said.

Nicklas was able to arrange her first flight to be with her husband and they were able to share their special moment with their customers.

""Just the fact that I can encourage anybody inspire anybody in any career field it doesn't have to be flying you know?"" Nicklas said. ""If you've been away from it and think it's insurmountable not attainable take the first step. There's no reason you can't do it."""

Josie St. Martin was one of only two 2006-born players on the Team USA U18 roster — and was the youngest player on the team — but still put up two goals in five games during the tournament to help the team to a silver medal.

The Minnesota native returned home from the tournament in mid-June and the very next day started getting calls from Division I college hockey programs.

St. Martin took her time with her decision before announcing her verbal commitment to play for the Ohio State University in early October.

""I think I made the perfect decision for me"" St. Martin said. ""Ever since I committed last week it's just been the best feeling ever. I can't get the smile off my face.""

St. Martin will be in familiar company with the Buckeyes in the future as she has played with fellow Minnesotans Emma Peschel and Sloane Matthews  who both are freshman at OSU along with Joy Dunne (St. Louis Mo.)  Syd Morrow (Darien Conn.)  and Alaina Giampetro (Strongsville Ohio) .

A self-described playmaker the forward has the ability to put the puck in the net all by herself or set up teammates with the assist. Over three varsity season so far with Stillwater St. Martin has put up 127 points (75 goals 63 assists) in 78 games.

""I love scoring goals I think everyone does"" St. Martin said.

The 16-year-old grew up in a hockey environment with various family members who played the sport. Originally St. Martin thought about becoming a goaltender. She tried out the position once in a youth hockey game but she decided that that it wasn't for her after giving up a game-winning goal.

After playing well for Team USA this summer St. Martin is hopeful to make the U18 team again to compete in the 2023 World Championships which will be held in January in Sweden.

The 5-foot-3 forward had a fun time competing for the U.S. in June and vividly recalls seeing fans packed in the stands at LaBahn Arena hearing them all chanting 'USA' and doing the wave.

The Team USA U18 roster will be announced later this year but until then St. Martin will be competing in her junior year of high school with the Ponies.

Stillwater posted a 13-11-1 record in 2021-22 but the team feels confident heading into the fall.

""We didn't finish the way we wanted to and I think that's really motivating for the group"" St. Martin said. ""It's always been everyone's dream to win the state title ever since we were little kids we've always been talking about it.""

St. Martin has two seasons left of high school hockey before likely hitting the ice for the Buckeyes in 2024-25.

When she's not competing out on the ice you can find the Minnesota native enjoying the outdoors by biking or enjoying time out on the water.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL2dvbGYvMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9jb2x1bWJ1cy1vaGlvLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLWJveXMtZ29sZi1kaXN0cmljdC10b3VybmFtZW50LXN0LWNoYXJsZXMtdXBwZXItYXJsaW5ndG9uLWR1Ymxpbi1qZXJvbWUvNjk1NTY1NTEwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walling leads St. Charles golf to Division I district title,"Leo Walling stayed focused on the task at hand and it worked.

The St. Charles junior who started on the back nine in the Division I district tournament Oct. 11 at Apple Valley birdied five consecutive holes after the turn on his way to 5-under-par 67 to share medalist honors with Worthington Kilbourne’s Owen Cotterman.

Walling's performance led the Cardinals (300) to their first district title since 2016 and a berth to state Oct. 21 and 22 at Ohio State’s Scarlet Course.

“I was 1-over through seven and just trying to make something happen” said Walling who qualified for state as an individual in 2020. “I (knew) we could score on these holes. ...

“You’re so focused you just put everything in the process and the product is going to make itself. The thing I tried to focus on was trying not to want it too bad. When you want it too bad that’s when it falls down so you just put everything into the shot.”

St. Charles will make its first state appearance since 2018. The Cardinals won state championships in 2009 and 2010.

“I told the guys before we played it was going to be whoever made the fewest mistakes” St. Charles coach Brian Unk said. “It’s not going to be a birdie-fest out there and then Leo went out and made five in a row. It helps when you have a guy that can erase a few mistakes from the other guys.”

Upper Arlington and Dublin Jerome each shot 307 to earn the other two team berths to state edging Dublin Coffman (309) and Olentangy Liberty (309). The Golden Bears will make their record 56th appearance and first since 2014.

Cotterman who also started on the 10th hole surprised himself with three consecutive birdies on Nos. 11-13. He also birdied No. 16 and shot a 33 on the back nine clinching one of three individual berths to state.

“I didn’t expect to go this far honestly” he said. “I shocked myself I guess. I came out feeling OK and it just worked out.”

Cotterman became the first Kilbourne player to qualify for state since Doug Christopher in 1998.

“I putted really well” he said. “I had a couple of mistakes in the middle. That happens. Then I got it back towards the end.”

Jerome secured its eighth consecutive state appearance. The Celtics won state titles in 2017 2018 and 2019 and have captured nine overall.

“I think it’s a testament to the kids’ mental toughness – all five of them” Jerome coach Colin Seely said. “Every shot matters out here. Bad shots happen (so) erase it and keep going and that’s all that matters. It showed today.”

DeSales’ Vaughn Harber (70) and Mount Vernon’s Ben Bridges (73) earned the second and third individual-qualifying spots.

Harber gives DeSales its first representation at state since it advanced as a team in 2013. The Stallions who finished sixth (314) were in Division II until 2020.

Bridges became the first from Mount Vernon to qualify since Robert Williams in 2014. He edged Pickerington North’s Tyler Brockwell (74) in addition to Coffman’s Ryan Schiefferle and Liberty’s Jackson Harris and Carter Rutherford (each 75).

“The tees were back the pins were hard and the course was really firm” Unk said. “When it gets that firm around the greens it gets tougher. The scores don’t surprise me it was just firm and windy and that’s tough.”

The impetus for the new organization which boasts approximately 50 staff and two locations in Virginia and Tennessee was to consolidate a number of different directed energy projects being worked throughout the company according to Joe Shepherd HELworks president and chief executive officer.

“Now that we’ve been able to progress as we have with that tech maturation and we have real solutions and a product portfolio that addresses the warfighter’s needs this time was perfect for us to be able to position this segment of the business to deliver those capabilities separately through HELworks” he told Breaking Defense in an Oct. 6 interview ahead of the announcement.

HELworks will start out with three directed energy projects under its purview all at different stages of development according to Shepherd.

The Modular Compact High Energy Laser nicknamed MCHEL is a static 12 kw weapon designed for ground engagements and already delivered to “the customer.” (Booz Allen Hamilton declined to disclose the identity of said customer.) The company claims it is the “smallest lightest and most portable HEL weapon for its mission.”

The High Energy Laser Mission Equipment Package (HEL MEP) is a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic air defense capabilities designed to be outfitted on a US Army Stryker vehicle. Shepherd said Booz Allen is in the final stages of development and integration for that weapon system and it will be featured in a demonstration at Fort Sill in Oklahoma later this year.

The third initiative dubbed LightEngine is “essentially a powered and cooled laser that can be the common core infrastructure for a number of HEL systems” according to Shepherd.

Booz Allen’s endeavor to stand up HELworks comes as the Pentagon continues to push directed energy weapons out of the research and development holes of the past decade and into operations. The Army Navy and Air Force have all been advancing various high energy laser projects this year.

For the military directed energy — if it can be mastered — offers both methods of destroying adversarial unmanned aerial systems or munitions at a cheaper cost than traditional kinetic weapons as well as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities through the powerful optics required to use laser weapon systems.

Asked what has been the biggest stumbling block for industry to move the technology forward Shepherd said it has come down to packaging the weapons in a way that the Pentagon can integrate them onto different platforms.

“Getting this capability on the right platforms for the operational mission has been a challenge” he said. “These HEL systems and DE systems generally tend to be large and clunky because a lot of the systems that have been materialized and… [from a] prototyping perspective operationalized in the last number of years have been exactly that: operational prototypes.

“There hasn’t been a big focus on the packaging of those [lasers] onto relevant platforms or mission applicability. So that’s been the big challenge. And I think that’s where HELworks is really focused” he continued.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLXVudmVpbHMtZHJvbmUta2lsbGluZy1taWNyb3dhdmUtd2VhcG9uL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLXVudmVpbHMtZHJvbmUta2lsbGluZy1taWNyb3dhdmUtd2VhcG9uLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Dynamics unveils drone-killing microwave weapon,"General Dynamics Land Systems a business unit of General Dynamics global aerospace and defense company has unveiled a prototype high-power microwave weapons system on Stryker chassis at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual convention.

Couple give up $3.5 million property for a life on the road with their four kids

A family have described how they gave up a luxury lifestyle and sold their $5million home and farm to hit the road and homeschool their four kids while living in a motorhome.

Landon Jones 41 and his wife Kami 33 quit their jobs and sold everything they owned - including their $3.5 million home - for a life on the road.

Landon who was national sales director at a Fortune 500 company said they sold up and bought themselves a 400-square-foot motorhome to travel around the United States to spend more time as a family.

The couple felt that their lifestyle didn't line up with their priorities and decided to reevaluate their situation.

Besides their home in Columbine valley Colorado USA the couple also sold several vehicles and farming property worth $2.1 million.

The family of six who were used to the high life now live on the road in the motor home they bought for $500000.

Landon was a national sales director at Stryker a medical tech company while Kami was a stay-at-home mum.

His job had afforded him the dream home farming property and every luxury that a position at a Fortune 500 company can offer even so the grind was too much.

For the couple it was a no brainer they had to focus on spending more time with their family and living a simpler lifestyle.

Landon said: ""When we looked at our calendars we saw that they didn't mimic what our priorities where.""

""We as a family decided that we really wanted to prioritise what mattered most to us and at the top of that list was faith and right under that was family.

""Part of that is giving up some of our earthly possessions.""

In the summer of 2021 they decided to give it all up and Landon gave the firm his six-month notice.

In April 2022 their dream finally came true and they moved into their 400-square-foot motor home.

Their new home is fully equipped with a kitchenette a bathroom washing and drying machines and bunks to house all six family members.

According to Landon the decision was a no brainer.

He added: ""At the end of the day we were so convicted. We have this small window of time to raise these boys that god gave us to raise them the right way.""

Once the family hit the road they knew they had made the right decision.

Landon and Kami began homeschooling their sons and they felt absolute freedom for the first time.

He added: ""It was extremely liberating knowing that every single day what we did how we did it and who we did it with was at our discretion.""

""For the first time the calendar was out the window and we were completely present and we were able to be completely present with our children.""

The boys Arlo two Otis three Winston five and Julius seven are homeschooled for a couple of hours-a-day and have their learning supplemented by their travels.

Landon added: ""Learning has become so fun and we're doing it together.

""There is an amazing community of people that live similar lifestyles to us.

""So when we arrive at a campsite there's an abundance of children that can relate to our boys.""

The family has received criticism for how extravagant their life appears with a 400sq-ft RV but Landon acknowledges this with good-naturedly.

He said: ""To put it in perspective. It is a very nice RV. But this is our everything and the median cost of a home in Denver was six-hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

""We did not exceed that and the RV was less than a tenth the cost of out old home."""

RALEIGH N.C. (October 10 2022) – 321 Coffee Raleigh’s first coffee shop that employs people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is proud to partner with technology giant Lenovo and Engage NC a non-profit providing venture financing to make the workforce an inclusive space for people with all abilities. As part of this new partnership 321 Coffee will open a fully accessible roasting facility filled with Lenovo technology helping them scale the company’s roasting capacity and enabling them to create new jobs and hire additional staff.

321 Coffee employs more than 40 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. These staff members show up every day excited to work and ready to contribute by roasting coffee taking orders making drinks and interacting with customers.

Currently 321 Coffee has a waiting list of more than 100 people with disabilities who want to work for the company. With the addition of the roasting facility job capacity at 321 will grow to support an estimated 200 new work hours per week for people with disabilities.

“There are many physical barriers that make roasting coffee with standard equipment difficult for our staff – those bags weigh upwards of 30lbs and you typically have to raise them above your head to pour them into the roaster” said Lindsay Wrege co-founder and CEO 321 Coffee. “With the help of our community partners Lenovo and EngageNC 321 Coffee will be able to address this challenge and remove similar barriers through innovative design and technology to make the process more accessible.”

As part of this partnership Lenovo is providing $150000 and EngageNC is providing $50000 to support the build and operation of the roasting facility during its first three years of operation. Lenovo is also providing $15000 worth of technology to make the facility accessible for all 321 staff members.

“At Lenovo our mission is to provide smarter technology for all and we are proud to partner with organizations like 321 Coffee that are committed to fostering a more inclusive community here in Raleigh” said Gerald Youngblood chief marketing officer Lenovo North America. “Technology has the ability to open doors for the future of a more accessible workforce and we are grateful for this opportunity to implement Lenovo technology in a space where it will make a lasting impact.”

This technology partnership will help enable workplace independence so that 321 staff are empowered and confident in performing their job tasks without concern of ability. 321 staff will undergo individualized training on how to use this equipment and accommodations will be made as needed to achieve job independence throughout the various roles.

The additional financial support from EngageNC will help bring these plans to life. EngageNC has been working with 321 Coffee since its early days of operating pop-up coffee shops providing early financing and mentoring.

Bruce Kirschenbaum President of EngageNC said: “Our mission is to create employment opportunities for adults with Autism and other developmental disabilities. When we first heard about the plans of 321 Coffee to employ this population we reached out and were very impressed with the vision and drive of their founders Lindsay Wrege and Michael Evans. Their goals were perfectly aligned with our vision and we wanted to support their business to increase the local job creation for this underserved population”.

To bring more public awareness to this innovative workplace 321 will host tours and workshops at the roasting facility welcoming other companies and individuals inside to showcase this new accessible technology in action and demonstrate how others can be more inclusive in their practices.

321 Coffee plans to start building out the roasting facility in October 2022 as part of National Disability Awareness Month. For more information about 321’s locations visit here.",,,,,,,,,

Synchrony which operated a call center and took up the entire 150000 square-foot building it was using at 4500 Munson St. just north of Canton and west of I-77 went remote last year after polling its workers. It found they overwhelmingly preferred working from home.

""During the pandemic obviously everyone went to work from home. In September of 2020 we looked at a survey of our employees and 86% said they'd like to work from home permanently"" said Synchrony senior vice president of communications Lisa Lanspery.

By the end of 2021 Synchrony had decided to do as its employees requested and went to a flexible work structure under which people would work from home which meant it no longer needed that big building.

The building's owner Envision USA a real estate investment firm in Great Neck New York is now looking to sell or lease the entire site but is also considering converting it to apartments said Envision founder principal and CEO David Monassebian.

""We're looking to lease it or sell it"" Monassebian said. ""Synchrony has decided to vacate and they've basically already vacated.""

Monassebian said Synchrony had been a good tenant and fulfilled its lease but losing a tenant is never easy let alone one that took a whole large building.

""It's not really positive for us because we own the building and we're looking for an office tenant"" Monassebian said.

But at least Synchrony left him with a nice space to market. The company had just finished updating its space when it decided to go remote Monassebian said so its former offices are in brand-new condition.

""I would say it's a Class A building — it's in excellent condition"" Monassebian said. ""They put in a lot of new furniture and equipment before COVID then when the pandemic started people started working from home — and before people went back to work they decided to work from home full time. ... This is a really unique opportunity for a tenant because someone built it all out for a call center and then walked away.""

The building was constructed in 2000 and Monassebian said his firm purchased it in 2015. His first choice now is to lease or sell the entire building but he's also considering other options.

One such option is converting the building to residential.

""We're actually exploring that possibility"" Monassebian said. ""We've just started looking into the possibility of converting the building to residential. I spoke with a representative of Stark County and they said there is a demand for housing in Stark County so based on that need we're exploring the possibility of converting it to residential. It depends on whether the economics make sense.""

But Monassebian points out he's neither a local owner nor a developer so he would need a local partner to proceed with a conversion.

""One of the things I'm looking for is a developer or general contractor who would be interested in partnering with us on a conversion"" he said.

The property itself is a good one said Dan Spring president of NAI Spring a North Canton real estate firm. Spring is not involved with the building but specializes in industrial and office space in the region and has seen the former Synchrony building since it was vacated.

""He's exactly right"" Spring said of Monassebian's glowing description of the building. ""Truthfully it looks brand-new on the inside; it's incredible. It's a nice space and well laid out.""

Spring said that while the office market has softened nationally and across most of Ohio it's held up better in Canton than most other places.

""Around here our office (sector) has still been pretty good. I haven't seen that market change too much"" Spring said.

""But the big spaces are tougher"" Spring added and 150000 square feet is a huge space for Canton and Jackson Township.

""The difficulty with a space like that is there are not a lot of 150000-square-foot users. It's a matter of splitting it up or finding a big user"" Spring said. ""If he goes down to the 30000-square-foot size there are some people looking at that size.""

As for a residential conversion Spring said that's an interesting idea and one he's seen employed elsewhere around Canton — and it's been a big part of development in Akron and Cleveland.

But those developments have mostly been in downtowns while the Munson Street building is in a suburban location. But it's a location where a lot of people want to live.

""I haven't seen as much (residential conversion) in the suburbs … but he's got a phenomenal location"" Spring said. ""There's no city income tax there which a lot of companies like. There's an airport highways lots of restaurants — it's in a great place.""

Perhaps a Synchrony employee could live there. The company says it's leaving the building but not the market.

Synchrony has not only kept the employees who were working at its Canton office as well as another near Dayton that also went to remote work it has told state officials it plans to add 300 new employees in Ohio over the next four years said Lanspery.

The company does not disclose how many people it employs by state or location but when it closed its location in Kettering near Dayton — which has since sold for $7.5 million — it reportedly had 1900 employees there and Lanspery did not dispute that figure. In total the company employs more than 18000 people nearly all of them in the U.S. she said.

Instead of two much larger facilities near Cleveland and Dayton Synchrony in Ohio is centered around a new 50000-square-foot office in Columbus. While its employees mostly work from home that central ""hub"" serves as an office for any workers who want to use one and also provides space for meetings and other collaborative efforts Lanspery said.

Allowing its employees to work from home has made it easier for Synchrony to attract new employees in an environment where workers were hard to find and also to keep them she said. The company also raised its own minimum wage to $20 an hour but it's the remote work she cites first as a reason applications are up 30% from where they were before employees were allowed to work from home.

""Employees are seeking flexibility and choice when it comes to work. So by Synchrony offering this option we are seeing an increase in applications across the board"" Lanspery said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHliaXouY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMzI2NDMvc3luY2hyb255LXByb21vdGVzLW5ldy1leGVjdXRpdmUtbGVhZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Synchrony Promotes New Executive Leaders,"Synchrony (NYSE: SYF) a leading consumer finance company today announced the promotion of three leaders to its executive leadership team effective January 1 2023.

We had seen that before the pandemic the work hours were limited to the 9 to 5 routine but during and post-pandemic we found that employees have gotten increasingly used to the flexible ways of working. Flexibility also allowed them the opportunity to put more of their life into the work they do as they got to spend more time with their families. So inevitably employee flexibility and choice became two driving factors and we had to incorporate that into the business strategy as well. After all we attempted to balance meeting employee needs while ensuring the business continues to be successful.

As a result post this transition we have declared ‘New Way of Working’ which was all about ensuring a set-up where everyone had the freedom to work from home. Now we’re also setting up our regional engagement hubs across India which we have divided into five regions: north south east west and central. The intention is to try and get people to meet wherever they are and get the flavour of the work culture of Synchrony.

As employee experience becomes synonymous with talent management today what are your key focus areas when redesigning employee experience for the new world of work?

We started to change a lot of our employee policies since the onset of the pandemic and one of the things we focused a lot on is our employee wellbeing both mentally and physically. Even though we did lose some of our team members to the pandemic what I loved about our company was how driven we were to go out of our way to help our people in need be it through giving off-days financial support or strengthening our connections with them as we all went through this challenging time experiencing several difficult situations. In other countries we have seen salaries cut and we never did any of that because our focus was always the well-being of our people.

But a burning question today is ‘How do we stay in touch with the employee experience?’ We have had to ensure that a new joiner who has never experienced our work culture can do so virtually. We have an in-house app that has facilitated this in some ways by offering support to our people. However we’re still figuring out how to showcase our values and empower employees to experience moments of truth to see what is written on paper come to light. We as individuals are trying to emulate and distribute value and we are assessing employee feedback to continuously improve and reinvent our strategies; it is indeed a constant state of evolution.

To extend the conversation around employee experience and zero in on diversity and inclusion how is Synchrony setting out on its DEI agenda?

For me the proof of the pudding when it comes to the DEI policies are the stories I come across and the real impact on the ground. At Synchrony we want to welcome people regardless of where they come from; some of the interesting work we have done is in hiring veterans and empowering them to support their families even after their years of service.

Another successful tangent has been in the arena of women's diversity. Reports have shown how the participation of the women workforce in India is even lower than that in Bangladesh. As part of our DE&I agenda we are currently at a 49% women diversity with over 105 PwD employees and 40+ veterans and family members of veterans. Increasing access to opportunities for marginalised communities is imperative and so much of that starts with our hiring strategies.

As workplaces become more hybrid what will be the role of coworking spaces in building and sustaining employee connections and engagement?

After listening to our employees we initiated these regional engagement hubs where they can connect and engage with each other. This is truly a test to see how it will work and what will be its impact on strengthening the work culture of Synchrony. We cannot really underestimate the impact these engagement hubs have on building connections and driving engagement in a set-up that is primarily remote. By taking the initiative to make these facilities available and accessible to our people we’re also aligning with the need to ensure employee choice and flexibility in our talent strategies.

Finally what would be a word of advice or lessons you learned in leading talent management that you would like to share with our community?

As leaders we need to be ready to align and manage new employee expectations by listening to what they have to say. Again technology allows us plenty of opportunities to pick up on critical insights that can form the bedrock of creating and testing policies. We are always on the lookout for implementing best practices which is possible when we pay attention to the employee voice and see the impact on the work culture and the workforce.",,,

And the number of connections continues to grow. Even with supply chain disruptions and the overarching effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on chip manufacturing the number of global IoT connections grew by 8% in 2021 to 12.2 billion active endpoints according to IoT Analytics Spring 2022 report. With each connected device comes more data to process store connect and ultimately secure through various interfaces and systems all the way to the cloud.

The required solutions must not only support new innovations in high-speed interfaces such as PCI Express CXL and Ethernet for acceleration and new compute architectures but also provide the necessary high-grade security mechanisms without compromising throughput and latencies. By 2025 Statista projects that 79 zettabytes of data will be generated globally per year (for reference one zettabyte alone can hold 30 billion movies!). This overwhelming amount of data that can be corrupted replaced modified or stolen contains everything from entertainment confidential and sensitive consumer information to operational information that is critical to a business’s success and our general infrastructure. All of this directly correlates to increased threat risk and is pushing the industry to look at security as an integral part of design architecture not an afterthought. The addition of laws regulations and various privacy policies are also driving companies to bring SoC security to the forefront.

Today we are thrilled to announce that Synopsys is launching the industry’s broadest secure interfaces built specifically for high-performance computing (HPC) mobile automotive and IoT systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). The secure interfaces offer pre-verified solutions integrated with controllers for performance latency and area that are standards-compliant for the most widely used protocols. Ultimately these solutions allow SoC designers to quickly address and implement security with low risk and quick time-to-market.

Read on to learn about the fundamentals of securing interfaces and how Synopsys’ Secure Interfaces will help design teams achieve the highest levels of security for maximum data protection.

SoC design is critical for device security

It is important for design teams to get a comprehensive understanding of their threat environment to accurately protect data infrastructure and devices. From cloud API vulnerabilities and account hijacking to ransomware and man-in-the-middle attacks a preemptive approach to SoC design is critical to ensure security and protect against all kinds of threats. As shown in the figure below there are many interfaces in the SoC that need to be secured from physical attacks and tampering. Securing interfaces (e.g. DDR PCIe CXL Ethernet MIPI USB UFS eMMC HDMI and DisplayPort) and the data that moves across them starting in the design phase can prevent data from being accessed deleted or otherwise manipulated by bad actors.



SoCs have many interfaces that require security.

Securing interfaces at a hardware level and implementing zero-knowledge architecture so that the data is encrypted and can’t be used maliciously even if it’s accessed can make a world of difference.

The foundation of secure interfaces

There are two main components necessary for secure interfaces. The first is the authentication and key management component that is typically tied to the control plane and the second addresses the bulk integrity and data encryption between two endpoints that is tied to the data plane. The latter component is related to keeping up with bandwidth requirements ensuring low latency etc. How and where these are addressed in an SoC depends on the specific interface. For example PCIe and CXL interfaces have similar security schemes that house the authentication and key management and need to be run in a secure environment and Integrity and Data Encryption (IDE) for the data plane.

Beyond this SoC designers need to account for an added level of complexity when making many types of interfaces secure. There are a variety of standards bodies that are constantly changing requirements even as we write this blog post. These standards need to be added at different levels meaning that the protocols can be implemented at the system level within the controller within the PHY or within the PHY and controller.

Security is now taking center stage in the semiconductor industry and all interfaces and data that move across them need to be secure; after all an SoC is only as secure as its weakest entry point. Even if all the base-level protocols and standards are met designers need to be sure that the entire system is protected. Security goes beyond encryption and decryption; if important configuration registers or keys are compromised the security of the entire system is also compromised.

Secure interfaces

The beauty of the Synopsys secure interfaces is that they cover the entire spectrum of interfaces that designers need to consider for a variety of different applications such as HPC mobile IoT and automotive.

Synopsys offers complete and secured mobile storage IP solutions including controllers and PHYs for UFS and SD/eMMC.

The demand for secure interface solutions will only grow

Security will continue to be top of mind both for SoC designers and standards bodies. When security was added to the PCIe and CXL standards in 2020 the demand for security IP was very aggressive specifically for high-performance computing applications. Autonomous vehicles and the electrification of these vehicles introduce security risks that are being addressed by today’s specifications used in cars for networking ADAS camera/sensor connectivity and displays.

The security field is dynamic; as technology evolves so do the threats and ways to attack systems requiring increasingly reliable resilient security solutions across the board that will be required around the world (whether it be region-specific or truly global). Additionally as emerging technologies such as quantum computing become available they will have the ability to break all the public key infrastructure algorithms that are used today. This means that standards will need to adapt to include quantum-safe algorithms for new standards over the coming 5 to 10 years and beyond.

In conclusion baking security into SoCs is mandatory and continues to be influenced by the evolution of our connected world laws regulations and standards. Security is being adopted more aggressively across all interfaces including new initiatives for MIPI VESA and UCIe. Synopsys has its own experts who are participating in the top standards working groups to ensure that our entire secure interface products is at the forefront of compliance making security simple for customers across industries.

That makes them extremely hard to find.

Silent data errors (SDEs) are random defects produced in manufacturing not a design bug or software error. Those defects generate software failures which Meta and Google separately reported in papers last year. What makes these errors so concerning is their randomness the low number of defects and the difficulty in detecting the failing CPUs. That has raised a call for action in the semiconductor test community.

Simply put manufacturing testing needs to improve. But understanding the nature of the errors why they are hard to detect and why we are seeing them now underscores the rising compute intensity inside data centers the complex interactions between various components and software and the importance of getting this right.

“The growth of both the scale of data centers — millions of CPUs installed and managed by a single cloud service provider — and the increase in silicon integration with higher core count larger silicon area in a single SoC package has increased the visibility of all failure modes including SDE” said David Lerner senior principal engineer for product development quality and reliability at Intel. “In addition the development by Intel of DCDIAG and related tests along with increased focus monitoring and test writing by data centers has made the SDE phenomenon more apparent.”

But it hasn’t simplified the process of finding them. Different engineering teams have access to different levels of data which has led to a number of theories about the causes of these errors as well as the electrical stimulus and environmental conditions that would result in a better test. These manufacturing defect escapes are due to either missing test coverage at time zero or the latent nature of the defect. Some industry experts speculate the errors may also be due early degradation characteristics as a consequence of actual workloads.

Understanding the physical defects provides engineers guidance on screening methods. But first it’s essential to know the stimulus and environmental conditions that point to the errors.

What data centers see

Cloud service providers use millions of server chips that run 24 x 7 with various applications workloads and maintenance. In the past few years software engineers began to notice erroneous behavior traced to a specific to a small subset of server machines known as silent data corruption (SDC) corrupt execution errors (CEE) or silent data errors (SDE).

Google engineers described the mysterious behavior’s impact in their 2021 paper “Cores That Don’t Count” as follows:

“Imagine you are running a massive-scale data-analysis pipeline in production and one day it starts to give you wrong answers — somewhere in the pipeline a class of computations are yielding corrupt results. Investigation fingers a surprising cause: an innocuous change to a low-level library. The change itself was correct but it caused servers to make heavier use of otherwise rarely used instructions. Moreover only a small subset of the server machines are repeatedly responsible for the errors.”

CPUs are essential to managing operations and computations inside of data centers but incorrect computing can have huge consequences. In their 2021 paper “Silent Data Corruptions at Scale” Meta engineers explained as follows:

“It manages the devices schedules transactions to each of them efficiently and performs billions of computations every second. These computations power applications for image processing video processing database queries machine learning inferences ranking and recommendation systems. However it is our observation that computations are not always accurate. In some cases the CPU can perform computations incorrectly. For example when you perform 2 x 3 the CPU may give a result of 5 instead of 6 silently under certain microarchitectural conditions without an indication of the miscomputation in system event or error logs.”

In their respective papers both Meta and Google engineers listed examples of the consequences in applications they have seen SDEs. Among them:

Compression and decompression of files in which a file is lost because it is wrongly computed as have a size of zero;

Database index corruption leading to some queries being non-deterministically corrupted;

Wordcounts on files that result in inaccurate values for some words;

In a storage system data corruption affecting garbage collection resulting in the loss of live data; and

Encryption and decryption of files in which the decryption results in nonsense.

With silent data errors the faulty values pass on to the next computation and the consequences can be indirectly noted which makes it harder to debug. To determine the source engineering teams executed a diligent debug process and learned that errors were highly dependent upon the numerical values fed into the computation. These values differed for each defective core. Such behavior indicates a subtle failing behavior that requires very specific excitation.

The impact of the resulting faults eventually caused both companies to investigate the cause. Both papers noted that SDEs can be traced to a specific core on specific server chips. Still locating root causes for hardware defects in a huge software stack is a non-trivial effort which Meta engineers described in detail. The Meta infrastructure team initiated their investigation in 2018 to understand multiple detection strategies and the associated data center performance cost to support such detection. After three years of work they learned a lot and illustrated the data dependence upon errors. Root causing to Core 59 on a CPU specifically they noted that calculating the INT (1.153) = 0 and INT (1.152) = 142.

Computer engineers have long held the assumption that escaped defects will become fail-stop or fail-noise errors and hence trigger machine checks or generate wrong answers for many instructions. With these silent data errors this is no longer the case. They clearly are a cause for concern for both data center owners and IC suppliers.

Nature of the failures

To be successful with any detection strategy whether it’s inspection-based ATE test or system-level test engineers need to know much more about the nature of these failures. All investigations rule out overall circuit design marginality. These failures are due to processing defects. However because the ultimate tests involve customers exercising their systems in mission-mode thermal voltage and frequency conditions can exacerbate a localized defect that under other conditions would pass. Targeted experiments performed at data centers have shown that a small percentage of these SDEs only show up after a specific length of operating time.

To develop detection solutions full understanding of the failure mechanism is needed. The CSPs can narrow it down to code snippets but they don’t necessarily know all the other parameters. This is due both to the difficulty of tying a software code snippet to specific circuit faults environmental conditions and a process window localized with precision to the circuit defect.

“It’s very possible that we’re facing defects coupled with circuit design margin” said Adam Cron distinguished architect at Synopsys. “Just a little push in any one variable puts them over the edge. Those pushes are a little bit of heat a little bit of voltage droop a little bit more resistance in a contact. These small perturbations are not modeled in the models given to designers. And they’re not tested in that manner until they’re put into a customer’s system.”

The key is in the details of the various conditions and use cases. “If you understand how these conditions vary under different workloads and connect the various views in space and time you will be able to root cause issues more quickly” said Nitza Basoco vice president of business development at proteanTecs. “The root causes of silent data corruption effects are an important topic for our industry. If we could diagnose the physical and electrical causes we can come up with better detection methods. Right now there are many postulations on the causes of these time-zero escapes and reliability failures. Understanding the mix and contribution level for each is our industry’s next area of focus.”

For a 5nm CMOS ASIC product at a data center — not Google or Meta — one industry source said that product engineers shmooed the customer returns over temperature voltage and clock frequency with the ATE test content (Schmooing is sweeping a test condition parameter through a range). A vast majority of them failed at specific points in the shmoo. They also noted that a small percentage of the units failed the production level ATE test indicating reliability related failures.

With the transition from planar to finFET CMOS transistors it’s reasonable to expect the increased processing complexity to uncover defects that exhibit more subtle behaviors.

“There’s definitely some contribution from finFETs because if you have multiple fins and one of them is defective it causes parametric behavior” said Jansuz Rajski vice president of engineering for Tessent at Siemens EDA. “So depending on the test conditions and the path tested you may or may not detect it. With planar transistor defects there would be a higher probability that it will result in a more substantial faulty behavior that you would be able to detect.”

These problems are not new however. In a 2014 International Test Conference paper titled “Process Defect Trends and Strategic Test Gaps” Intel authors highlighted an emerging defect with a much more complex faulty behavior. Their description of defects with marginal behavior match with current knowledge of SDEs. In their abstract they summarized the situation as follows:

“Lithography challenges are beginning to replace `FAB dirt’ as the more challenging source of defects to detect and screen at test” Intel engineers wrote. “These new defects often cause marginal behaviors not gross failures with subtle signatures that differ significantly from both traditional defects and from parametric process variation. Testing for subtle marginalities in effectively random locations exposes important gaps in prevalent test strategies. The strongest marginality screens focus on fixed locations and the strongest random defect screens look for grosser signatures. These trends and gaps will drive critical new requirements for fault modeling test generation and test application and implementing them effectively will require a new level of collaboration between process and product developers.”

In investigating customer failing units with SDE behaviors Intel’s Lerner noted that even properly identifying a defect as an SDE can be a challenge. “From what we have observed the defects that may cause silent data errors (SDE) are generally no different than those defects that cause detectable errors both correctable and uncorrectable” Lerner said. “Whether a defect causes an SDE as opposed to a machine check error (MCE) is primarily a function of where the defect occurs.”

Why SDEs are hard to detect

Compared to consumer computers microprocessors bound for data centers have longer logic test patterns run at wafer and final test. In addition 100% of server chips are tested using a system-level test which runs functional test patterns with long test times — 40 to 60 minutes is typical. Yet despite the test content volume test flow parts exhibiting SDE behavior escaped.

To understand the challenges in creating test content for either traditional digital testing or functional test testing consider that the reported SDEs involved a computation addition subtraction division and multiplication. For 16-bit adder to functionally calculate all combinations it needs to run 232 unique combinations. Assuming a 1 GHz clock this represents 4.24 seconds. For just an ALU’s adding function this represents an inordinate amount of test time. Decades ago similar extremely long test times for simpler logic ASICs prompted IC suppliers to use fault models based upon manufacturing defects. While including more intelligence about the adder design at the transistor and interconnect level can reduce the functional combinations to something smaller this remains a non-trivial engineering task.

Structural tests based upon fault models can be graded. Within the universe of possible faults for a device under test (DUT) you can simulate structural tests to determine the coverage. At one time 98% stuck-at fault coverage was considered high coverage and sufficient. That’s no longer true. In addition defects impacting the circuit path timing need to be detected. Today multiple test coverage metrics exist for stuck-at faults transition faults and cell-aware faults.

Using functional test pattern coverage calculations and linking them to digital fault models has been an area of research and has yet to be solved.

“You can’t say ‘Well I booted the OS and determined what potential faults that covered'” said Peter Reichert system-level test system architect at Teradyne. “There’s not a path to get from one to the other. For traditional tests we have a way of identifying faults and a way of grading our test programs against the faults. With instruction tests performed at system-level test we don’t really have that ability. It’s very hard to map an action like running a specific program on a processor to what faults will it find.”

Functional test patterns run instructions within a CPU. Test engineers can detect unique defects because the patterns create conditions that differ from structural tests and thus activate the defective circuit in a way a faulty behavior can be detected. In effect a functional test pattern more closely mirrors the behavior in a customer system. Functional patterns can be applied during ATE test and system-level test. However the temperature controls and voltage levels are greater in an ATE tester than in a customer system. So while system-level testers look more like a customer system they also offer a more precise control of voltage levels and temperature.

So why doesn’t SLT detect these faulty server chips? Part of the answer is in the behavior. These are silent data errors. If you don’t specifically look for them you won’t find them.

“I work with high performance digital customers U.S. and worldwide and certainly this is a serious and frustrating topic for a lot of them” said Dave Armstrong principal test strategist at Advantest America. “Why is system-level test inadequate at finding these 100 to 1000 PPM defects? You’ve got to remember that any tester ATE or system-level or something else is a programmed general-purpose resource. If the resources exist on the tester which I believe they do then the software is not there or the test programming has not been performed to find the errors.”

While the resources probably do exist on the tester the right test conditions are required to find the problems. SDEs occur at very low defect rates and they occur randomly on any core inside a server chip or any single computational circuit block on that core. Running all possible computations takes a huge amount of time.

“Why doesn’t this system level test catch it? The only answer I have for you is because the test isn’t focused enough to capture it but I don’t know how to do this. This is the challenge of system level test that right now I don’t know how to improve upon. Like you said if I have to do every numeric computation possible that’s obviously not practical” said Teradyne’s Reichert.

It took Google and Meta engineers thousands of engineering hours to find SDEs. Recently a cloud service provider engineer reported that using a specific detection strategy it takes 15 days to screen the company’s fleet of 1 million servers.

Moving software applications failures to a system-level test content can be done.

“Historically testing specifically targeting failures that manifest solely as SDE was limited” said Intel’s Lerner. “While there was certainly some system-level test in place for detection of SDE failures the low rate of observance in the field did not suggest there was a high rate of SDE occurring due to defects. Recently Intel increased its investment in tests specifically targeted to detect SDE. Today these tests are screening defects that may have been missed previously.”

But SDEs remain difficult to find due to the need for randomness in the SLT patterns which impacts the length of time to detection. In addition the repeatability of tests can be low for some defects. In a 2022 ITC paper “Optimization of Tests for Managing Silicon Defects in Data Centers” Intel authors noted there are ‘easy-to-detect’ and ‘hard-to-detect’ defects using the cumulative DCDIAG time needed to detect them.

What else can IC suppliers do?

Cloud service providers have worked closely with their server SoC suppliers to provide system-level test content that contains SDE occurrences. To improve screening many industry experts believe more can be done during the manufacturing inspection and test processes.

“The screening has to be much better” said Andrzej Strojwas CTO at PDF Solutions. “Can the test quality be improved? Definitely. We actually see quite a bit of data that shows front end is a big contributor and front-end systematic defects can be translated into logic cells. Two things are absolutely necessary — cell-aware diagnosis and cell-aware fault models that take into account these front-end systematic defects”

Understanding circuit design margin for a range of test environment conditions (frequency voltage temperature) can provide additional insight. First you need to find the test content that duplicates in some manner the customer’s software code.

“Software-derived tests will allow us to focus in and find the problems and the margins more effectively” said Advantest’s Armstrong. “You need to know this upfront in pre-silicon validation first silicon and post-silicon. In addition you need to continuously learn from your RMAs. Also being able to rerun a test based on the new software whether it’s a new library or new code that identifies a certain problem is really important.”

Once you have this then you need to understand the test environment as localized as possible to the circuit block with the defect. “Creating arrays of sensors internal to the design and combining analytics enhances your understanding of device operation” said proteanTecs’ Basoco. “Information on power voltage droop timing margin and noise sensors can provide context on an application being run. Other meta data on when the activity occurs and measurement location is also necessary. If you understand how these conditions vary under different workloads and connect the various views in space and time you will be able root cause issues more quickly.”

Such data was not available to the data center engineers reporting out. “At a workshop I listened to a Google engineer present about these SDEs” said Synopsys’ Cron. “I typed a question ‘Do you have any SLM data that goes with your time of issue?’ The answer: ‘No they have got no such data. So we couldn’t even guess what’s going on in there.’ You know maybe there is a hot temperature issue.”

Engineers always appreciate more data. Detection and then diagnosing based on that data is essential.

“This is where SLM comes in because now if you’re monitoring all the various environmental conditions — process voltage temperature and path delays — and you’re doing this on a regular basis you can see what was going on in that system when that failure occurred” said Steve Pateras vice president of marketing at Synopsys. “And then you’re getting data to help you diagnose whether there was a temperature spike and/or a voltage droop.”

Conclusion

The intersection between CMOS nodes at 10/7/5 nm lower operating voltages billions of transistors in data center CPUs with a large number of cores and data center owners with a fleet of millions of cores creates the ultimate stress test for these complex devices. In addition while reports have been specific to CPUs there is no reason that accelerators (e.g. GPUs TPUs) are impervious to the defect mechanisms causing these silent data corruption errors during computation.

While there is every indication is that you can’t fully test your way out of SDEs in customer’s systems the test engineering teams will respond. An unprecedented collaboration between process product test and system development teams in along with end customers is needed.

BOW – Drivers for Sysco the Houston-based food service giant went on strike at three locations in New Hampshire on Oct. 1 when their union contract expired. Instead of spending up to 14 hours a day loading and unloading trucks and driving all over New England they’re picketing in Bow Manchester and Epping.

Indepth Your Inbox Get unbiased nonprofit watchdog news sent directly to your inbox.

The issues are pretty standard ones: pay insurance and retirement. But the conflict is about something more.

Daren Lones from Manchester was on picket duty Friday in Bow where Sysco trucks unload and reload behind Berube’s Truck Accessories on Route 3A. He’s been a Sysco driver for eleven years the last five of which he’s been driving shuttles. That means taking a tandem trailer from the company’s regional warehouse in Plympton Mass. to one of the yards where he meets up with the delivery drivers. Then he hauls two empty trailers back to Plympton. It’s back-breaking work he says and days can be 10 12 or even 14 hours long. It’s not just the pay that’s at issue he says “it’s the work.”

Dave Remick agrees. He’s a driver out of Manchester delivering all over New Hampshire. He’s also a union steward and a member of the union’s negotiating team. “The guys are working in the back of one of those trailers. You can’t believe how much work it is. They put it on pallets you gotta sweat through it. Pick through it. We’re working in every weather condition I mean snow sleet rain 95-degree weather we’re delivering. Upstairs downstairs we’re delivering to the beach delivering to boats we’re delivering in every possible place that you could think of” he said. “It’s tough. It’s very taxing on everybody.”

Sysco calls itself “the global leader in food distribution.” According to their website the company’s business is “selling marketing and distributing food products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home. Its family of products also includes equipment and supplies for the foodservice and hospitality industries.”

“We deliver to nursing homes all kinds of health care facilities we deliver to restaurants we deliver to schools colleges anybody pretty much that serves food” Remick said. Back when he started driving for Sysco nearly 23 years ago he said the company was “pretty good” to its workers. “But as time went on corporate out of Houston got more involved more involved. And as they did things started disappearing.” The things that were disappearing included a pension plan and some of their paid holidays.

When workers sought to organize a union the company brought in union busters (known more politely as “management consultants”) to stop them. “They fought us hard” Remick recalled. But the workers prevailed and are now members of Teamsters Local 653.

The first contract was good but not perfect. With every contract Remick said “you try to make it a little bit better a little bit better a little bit better.” You never get everything you want he said but it’s a negotiation. “It goes both ways you know the company still has to prosper and make money.”

Prosper they have. Sysco generated $68 billion in sales last year with net earnings of $1.4 billion more than double the previous year according to their 2022 annual report. The CEO’s compensation package topped $23 million last year. According to the AFL-CIO’s Executive Paywatch website that’s 309 times the median employee’s pay.

“It’s terrible that a company of that magnitude that makes that much money doesn’t care about their employees” Remick said. “We’re just really looking for a decent contract you know to care for our families and compensate us for being away from them.”

Sysco says it offered an excellent compensation package to those it calls its “associates.” In a statement released October 6 they said they’ve offered “industry-leading pay” with substantial raises over the life of the new contract plus a higher employer contribution to the health care plan. Instead of the union’s proposal to join the Teamster pension fund the company wants the “associates” to stick with the company-sponsored 401-K retirement plan.

“The Teamsters’ agenda” Sysco said “is aimed at gaining attention and promoting the interests of the union leadership.”

Remick rejects the company’s assertion that they were offering industry-leading pay. Apparently most other union members do too. When the proposal came up for a vote in late September members voted 175 to 5 to authorize a strike.

The strike involves about 300 drivers in New England. Another Teamsters local in upstate New York is on strike as well. The Food Management newsletter reported on October 7 that the company said it has “brought in third-party replacement drivers and is operating a 24/7 will call operation for customers.” We have also heard that non-union drivers from Maine are servicing New Hampshire routes.

The strike is Remick’s first and “it’s not fun” he said. To keep everyone’s spirits up the union members stay in regular contact with each other. “We’re all here for each other” he said “we try to keep everybody thinking positive.”

Remick is well aware that Sysco is not the only workplace in turmoil. Every week brings news of more organizing drives and strikes at college campuses fast food establishments distribution centers and retail chains. A nationwide rail strike is still a possibility.

“Right now I mean there’s a worker revolt I guess you’d call it you know what I mean? People are tired of corporate America” Remick said.

“At the end of the day” he added “we all want to go back to work. We don’t like this. But it’s necessary.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The momentum behind this direct-to-cell capability has shifted into a higher gear following early product launches big-name announcements and the progress startups are making for their dedicated cell-compatible constellations.

After years of rumors smartphone makers Apple and Huawei recently launched models capable of connecting to a partner’s satellites for emergency messaging services.

Apple’s iPhone 14 and Huawei’s new flagship Mate 50 series can facilitate limited SOS services beyond the reach of terrestrial cell towers — without a bulky handset antenna that usually accompanies satellite-compatible phones.

In August SpaceX unveiled plans to provide direct-to-cell services for emergency assistance and beyond in partnership with U.S. mobile operator T-Mobile.

These include text and picture messaging services available in the United States “as soon as late next year” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said during an Aug. 25 event at SpaceX Starbase in Texas. Voice video streaming and other high-bandwidth capabilities would come at an unspecified time after that.

While Apple is using Globalstar’s satellite spectrum and Huawei is leveraging China’s space-based Beidou navigation constellation SpaceX would use T-Mobile’s terrestrial wireless frequencies to connect phones outside cellular networks.

Instead of broadcasting from cell towers these frequencies would beam from upgraded Starlink satellites that SpaceX mostly uses to provide broadband services to fixed addresses.

U.S.-based startups Lynk Global and AST SpaceMobile have a similar direct-to-cell strategy.

They are busy forging alliances internationally to give their planned satellites access to mobile operator spectrum which would have more reach from space to serve a telco’s customers where its terrestrial infrastructure cannot.

There are five billion smartphones in circulation today and mobile dead zones are prevalent even in countries with widespread 5G networks. More than half a million square miles of the United States are untouched by terrestrial cell signals from any provider according to T-Mobile.

It is a compelling opportunity for satellite operators that can monetize these mobile dead zones and those looking to take advantage of the direct-to-cell hype.

Spanish startup Sateliot recently said satellite technology it is developing for small internet of things (IoT) devices could also be used to send and receive SMS messages from a regular handset.

While Sateliot CEO Jaume Sanpera says direct-to-cell was always part of its strategy he said the venture decided to go public with the plan following a spike in interest for the capability.

The startup has enough funding to deploy its first five operational satellites next year to connect other devices in remote areas Sanpera said but needs around $100 million for a full network of 250 satellites to provide direct-to-cell services.

“We really believe this will be a huge push for our Series B” he said “because there is real big business on the direct to phone connectivity.”

Sateliot’s approach also relies on convincing smartphone makers to add a compatible chip into their designs so their handsets can connect to its proposed satellites.

WAITING IN THE WINGS

Globalstar rival Iridium has been working on direct-to-cell technology for years but remains tight-lipped about its plans.

Iridium CEO Matt Desch told World Satellite Business Week in Paris Sept. 12 that it will “be involved in a big way” but declined to disclose details about a partner it is working with under a development contract.

Iridium said in July its deal with this unnamed company is contingent upon successful technology development and a service provider agreement it expected to finalize before the end of this year.

Other established satellite operators are closely following the growing momentum in the direct-to-cell market.

“It’s something we’ve had our eye on for a while” SES CEO Steve Collar said because it is one of the areas that could enable the satellite industry to play a role in a much broader ecosystem.

“Clearly there are big technical challenges” Collar cautioned “mainly just having a link that is powerful enough effectively to access a phone with a very poor performing antenna — relative to the antennas that we normally communicate with from space.”

It is also unclear whether the best strategy is to provide connectivity via mobile satellite spectrum (MSS) or terrestrial frequencies that have been assigned to mobile operators.

“As far as SES is concerned right now and today this is an opportunity rather than something that we’re concretely doing” he said.

“We’re still doing our homework and figuring out where we can play and where we can add value.”

In May SES obtained spectrum rights for 62 proposed satellites that were about to expire following a call for proposals from Luxembourg where SES is based.

These spectrum rights cover satellites operating between 8062 and 519 kilometers much closer to Earth than the 20 broadband satellites SES has in medium Earth-orbit (MEO) at 8063 kilometers.

SES also operates a fleet of satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) for broadband and broadcast services.

Collar noted that the major direct-to-cell projects announced to date are in low Earth orbit (LEO) below 2000 kilometers.

“One of the things that we’re looking at as we’re looking at possible architectures is does that have to be the case? Could you do this from some combination of GEO and LEO or LEO and MEO?”

Offering a direct-to-cell capability could also help SES play a part in Europe’s planned sovereign broadband constellation.

“We certainly haven’t made a decision that we would invest [in direct-to-cell services]” Collar said.

“It would be kind of a meaningful diversification for us moving into a different part of the value chain in the industry but we think there’s potential there and we’re working hard.”

Intelsat which operates a fleet of GEO satellites and has a distribution alliance with LEO broadband operator OneWeb also has satellite spectrum filings in MEO that could be used for a direct-to-cell service.

“We’re partnering right off the bat with OneWeb to get that [non-geostationary orbit] capability into our network but we’ve also been evaluating other opportunities internally” Intelsat chief commercial officer Michael DeMarco said.

Intelsat has not specified its plans for MEO and DeMarco said “anything that we come to market with would be complementary to the network that we have in place today.”

He said the operator is watching the direct-to-cell activity closely and “we’ll see how our multi-orbit architecture … can evolve to potentially capture share” as the market shakes out.

Inmarsat is also “very much in the investigative stage” said Barry French the operator’s chief marketing and communications officer.

“Some of the things you’ve seen announced so far are pretty far in the future” French said.

“There’s a lot of work to do between now and then — and the same is true for us” he added “but we do have this compelling L-band capability.”

While there are a lot of smartphones handset makers and connectivity providers he said there are few companies “who have the kind of global L-band spectrum coverage that we have. So we think we have a very clear asset that maybe others don’t.”

CAPABILITY EVOLUTION

While smartphone satellite connectivity first-movers Apple and Huawei are only planning basic services initially albeit seemingly for free they will likely add to the capability if the demand is there from consumers.

Apple has dedicated $450 million from its advanced manufacturing fund toward satellite infrastructure to support its SOS feature and is financing the majority of new Globalstar satellites that underpin the service.

Starting in November an app pre-installed on iPhone 14s will help users find and keep locked onto a Globalstar satellite to access Apple’s emergency service.

The feature would enable users outside a cellular network initially only in the United States and Canada to give emergency responders information by selecting from a series of short text messages.

Under ideal conditions Apple said these messages could take 15 seconds to send because of current bandwidth constraints and as long as three minutes in other cases.

Virginia-based Lynk which looks to be next in line to start providing initial direct-to-cell services aims to start by providing emergency alerts text messaging and connectivity for internet of things devices.

The startup secured regulatory approval Sept. 16 to operate its constellation globally after launching its first operational satellite in April.

Three more satellites are slated for deployment in December which would be enough to enable users to send and receive text messages about four to eight times a day depending on their latitude.

However Lynk has not yet secured landing rights in any country where it plans to provide services.

Charles Miller Lynk’s CEO said its next step is to secure a commercial contract with a mobile operator in the United States. The two companies would then jointly seek permission from the Federal Communications Commission to serve U.S. customers.

Lynk plans to deploy more than 50 satellites before the end of 2023 to increase satellite revisit times to every 15-30 minutes.

Texas-based AST expects to deploy its first operational satellites in late 2023. These will be much larger than Lynk’s pizza-boxed shaped satellites for providing higher-bandwidth 5G services.

At press time AST was weeks away from unfurling the antenna on its BlueWalker 3 prototype following its launch Sept. 10. At 64-square-meters it is the largest commercial antenna ever deployed to LEO.

AST Lynk and Starlink expect to connect phone users as seamlessly as they connect to cell towers through native device support.

Although T-Mobile’s Sievert said it is not ready to announce a product he expects to include satellite-enabled coverage in the United States under the telco’s most popular mobile plans for free.

T-Mobile will likely charge a monthly service fee for customers that want to add the coverage to some of its cheaper mobile plans.

SpaceX and T-Mobile are searching for mobile operators internationally with suitable frequencies to forge reciprocal roaming alliances.

T-Mobile is providing 1.9 GHz spectrum in the United States under their partnership.

Curiously SpaceX recently requested permission from the FCC to use the nearby 2 GHz spectrum band for MSS. This band is not used by terrestrial mobile operators suggesting SpaceX might be planning to avoid other providers altogether to sell services directly to consumers.

Lynk and AST envisage various types of partnerships with mobile operators.

“When you’re out of coverage you can receive a text from your mobile network operator and if you want to roam onto our network then you can click ‘yes’ and you can buy a day pass” AST chief strategy officer Scott Wisniewski said. “Or you can sign up to a recurring ‘add-on’ for your monthly plan.”

Wisniewski said AST intends to provide an invisible layer of connectivity for consumers leaving the consumer-facing business to the mobile operator.

“We bring the network and the mobile network operator brings the customers the spectrum and their marketing power” he said enabling AST “to leverage those things that they’ve already built.”

Miller said Lynk will also be a wholesale partner for mobile operators and will never go “direct to consumer.”

However he said Lynk is still deciding whether to be a consumer-facing brand or just a provider of white label-enabling technologies to mobile carriers. “We have some ideas on this that we are not ready to share” he said.

While customers would use the SMS texting platform already built into their phone for sending messages through Lynk’s network he said the startup has developed an app called LynkCast to collect data broadcast from space. “LynkCast will be a service that allows everybody to get critical local information (weather news) delivered directly to your phone no matter where you are” he said via email.

“For example you are in a remote area? What is the weather prediction for the next several hours? The next several days? Is there a hurricane coming? A blizzard? Tornado conditions? Your life might depend on getting weather predictions.”

Both startups welcome the interest and activity their emerging market is receiving.

They say it is a market that will be big enough to support multiple players giving mobile operators alternatives and differentiated services for their satellite-enabled needs.

Apple iPhone 14 users could still tap into AST’s planned network Wisniewski said.

“Technology-wise there’s not really a fundamental incompatibility” he added. “The phone looks [for our satellite] if they’re in certain locations instead of looking for a tower and if someone else has some other feature on a different frequency or a different app you can do that without conflicting.”

It is ultimately up to the mobile operator. Just like how telcos “use multiple ground-based tower networks” Miller said “nothing stops them from using multiple satellite networks.”

On its posh third floor in a room with a conference space so big that each chair had a microphone so we could hear other reporters got to ask questions of the company’s new chief technology officer the head of its consumer business and FirstNet leaders among others. Here are the top seven takeways from the conferences.

1 – AT&T’s 5G SA core is being distributed nationwide

Jeremy Legg AT&T’s chief technology officer said historically the wired networks of copper and fiber were operated separately from the wireless network but AT&T is converging wired and wireless in municipalities across the country. And it’s also in the process of deploying its 5G standalone core. Unlike previous generations of wireless core technology AT&T is going to distribute the core software at sites around the country. “We want to federate where those cores sit” said Legg. “Cores have historically only been in a very few locations. We’re trying to put them in a lot more locations.”

He said this is important for voice applications where it’s nice to keep calls geographically close. And it could be really important in the future for uses such as autonomous cars. The company isn’t quantifying how many locations it might ultimately put 5G SA core software. “It’s really a function of what the demand curve looks like” said Legg. “We could put a core in 1000 edges.”

The company has thousands of central offices all around the country. A select number of these central offices are already running its 5G SA core software.

2 – The AT&T Integrated Cloud saves tons of space

AT&T Labs was a forerunner in the software-defined networking movement. It built the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) which is now running the company’s network functions. AT&T gave a tour of its central office in Dallas where reporters got to see the entire evolution of central office technology. First we saw the old copper lines in the basement running out to the street through a manhole. And then we saw the migration of technology from copper to fiber and from old-fashioned telco switches to proprietary black boxes from vendors which run the switching function.

Finally we saw the location of the AIC servers. These are kept in a highly air-conditioned space which is almost deafeningly loud from all the fans. The AIC equipment is highly compact compared to the old switching gear. As a side note Chris Sambar AT&T’s executive vice president for Network said the company spends “well over a billion dollars per year on power.”

Sambar described how AT&T had moved from proprietary equipment for its central offices to off-the-shelf servers that run networking software which AT&T Labs developed. AT&T has since sold this software to Microsoft which is free to resell it to other telcos around the world.

For its part AT&T still keeps all its network functions on its own premises at central offices running with its version of its network software. The company has a few hundred of these AIC cloud pods around the country.

Sambar said “Now we have this disaggregated architecture where we can control everything in the box. There’s a lot more flexibility in the network to mix and match. And we continue to make iterations on top.

AT&T uses public cloud providers for its less-sensitive storage and compute functions.

3 – AT&T is keeping an eye on Verizon’s Concierge Service

T-Mobile has been charging customers a $35 Assisted Support charge for new account signups. And Verizon is testing a Concierge Service which would cost customers $30 or $35 for higher levels of assistance when setting up their new phones. Asked if AT&T would follow the trend of charging customers for phone set-up and provisioning Jen Robertson executive vice president and general manager of AT&T’s Mass Markets which covers the consumer phone business declined to comment. She did say that AT&T will be watching what Verizon does with its Concierge Service.

AT&T already has a program called “Right to You” where customers can have their new phone delivered and then work with a customer service rep to get the device set up. Currently it’s only available in select zip codes. “We’re testing several models as we go through it” said Robertson.

4 – Hurricane Ian proves the value of amphibious equipment

Scott Agnew assistant vice president for AT&T’s FirstNet talked about the real-world emergency of Hurricane Ian in Florida.

Agnew said FirstNet had 150 individuals staged and ready to go in advance of the hurricane. FirstNet has a variety of emergency vehicles and first responder equipment. One thing that became relevant was its amphibious units. First responders could not initially get to Sanibel Island with their vehicles because the causeway collapsed. But the amphibious units were able to bring support and connectivity to the island. There are three cell sites on Sanibel Island and as of last Friday two of them had been restored. Agnew said the experience on Sanibel “proved amphibious vehicles.”

5 – AT&T believes in climate change

AT&T is sometimes in the news for its support of political leaders both Republican and Democrat. So it’s not clear whether company leadership has a partisan preference or just likes to hedge its bets. But one thing is clear – AT&T believes the climate is changing and it’s trying to reduce its carbon footprint.

Shannon Carroll AT&T’s assistant vice president of Corporate Sustainability said the company is driving its operations to net-zero as much as possible through renewable energy a low-emissions fleet and energy efficiency. It has contracts that will bring its energy mix to more than 35% renewables. But the company doesn’t have a goal for 100% renewable energy because Carroll said it’s just not feasible right now. With the rise in energy costs many renewable companies are swamped with work and deals with them are not available. AT&T is pursuing renewables development “because utilities aren’t” said Carroll.

The company has also integrated climate data into its network planning tools. Gordon Mansfield vice president of Global Technology Planning said “It’s important for us to design our networks with resiliency in mind. We have a climate change tool that we developed with Argonne Labs. We actually have our own weather department. Having those assets on staff allows us to plan.”

6 – AT&T is keeping an eye on companies like Helium Mobile

Joe Mosele vice president for Mobility IoT and 5G said AT&T is the leader in IoT in the U.S. based on the number of its IoT connections. It has 95.9 million connected devices and more than 53.3 million connected cars on the AT&T network.

China is the IoT leader in the world.

Asked if AT&T is interested in distributed wireless networks from the likes of Helium Mobile Jason Inskeep assistant vice president for private cellular MEC and edge said “Our teams are looking at it.”

7 – AT&T gives away computers

A team at AT&T led by Mylanyna Albright assistant vice president of Citizenship & Sustainability focuses on helping children gain access to computers and the internet. It’s in the process of creating AT&T Connected Learning Centers. “We couldn’t afford to take fiber to everyone’s house” said Albright. “The next best thing was at community centers. We’re providing three years of fiber three years of Wi-Fi and Dell computers.” The group already has learning centers in several states and is planning to have 20 by the end of this year. Most of the learning centers are in places where AT&T has fiber.

In addition to setting up learning centers with computers and internet connections AT&T is also giving refurbished laptops to kids.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLXBpeGVsLTctYmVzdC1wcmUtb3JkZXItZGVhbHMtb2ZmZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Pixel 7 & Pixel 7 Pro Pre-Order Deals: Google Store AT&T & More,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLXBpeGVsLTctYmVzdC1wcmUtb3JkZXItZGVhbHMtb2ZmZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtyaXN0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NvcnB1cy1jaHJpc3RpLXB1YmxpYy1saWJyYXJpZXMtcmVjZWl2ZS1ncmFudC1mdW5kaW5nLWZvci01LTAwMC1mcmVlLXdpLWZpLWhvdHNwb3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corpus Christi Public Libraries receive grant funding for free Wi-Fi hotspots,"CORPUS CHRISTI Texas — Mayor Paulette Guajardo and the City Council approved $2.4 million in grant money from the Emergency Connectivity Fund (EFC) for the Corpus Christi Public Libraries (CCPL) to provide 5000 Wi-Fi hotspot devices for residents that qualify.

To take advantage of I95 BUSINESS’ reach to executives at all levels we thought it best to stay in our lane and focus on how Diversity Equity Inclusion (DEI) impacts the bottom line. Why incorporating it is good for business – and what happens if you don’t. Human Resources and DEI executives helped us understand the importance of adding “Belonging” to these core values hence DEIB.

There was consensus that we needed to develop a program that would invigorate and motivate the right people to attend – those with decision making power across multiple departments and those who are tasked with integration of DEIB strategies. And through a business lens we hope to illustrate how your company will prosper how it affects your bottom line and helps your community grow.

While many of our sessions overlap they will each provide attendees with concepts that can be integrated into your business. The opening keynote focuses on the big picture – discussing the relationship between growing your company and growing community wealth so that both prosper – and why that is important. Our experienced panelists will open the lens on how this critical piece fits into your DEIB strategy.

While many enterprise level businesses have had diversity programs in place for years in the two years since Black Lives Matter there has been a growing public consciousness. It begins with the CEO who listens and learns from his people. This has led to the addition of Diversity professionals at many companies or diversity and inclusion councils. While this step is transformational the responsibility to execute across all levels continues to fall on the CEO. Executives must take charge in implementing best practices and making DEIB a part of their bottom line.

We are all on a journey. The format has no lectures just great conversations and sharing of ideas. Let’s continue to listen and learn.

Amy Seto Brown Advisory Partner

Endowments & Foundations Senior Advisor

By Alex Keown

Society is changing through an increased focus on diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) and it is imperative that businesses and organizations change with it. For Amy Seto Partner Endowments & Foundations Senior Advisor at Brown Advisory promoting the concepts of DEI is an important part of her daily life.

Her commitment to DEI is something that Seto will highlight during her keynote address at I95 Business DISRUPTION! event next month. Alongside the other keynote speakers Seto will focus on the topic of “Connecting How Businesses Win and Communities Grow” and ways of developing DEI concepts. When it comes to DEI Seto explains that there are different layers to the concept that go beyond simple demographics.

“You want diversity you can see but it’s also important to have people from various backgrounds” says Seto who earned her MBA from Johns Hopkins University.

As an example she points to her own employment background. Before coming to Brown Advisory to serve as a resource for client teams focused on endowments and foundations Seto spent more than a decade in the non-profit world. Seto previously served as the executive vice president and chief operating officer at the Baltimore Community Foundation where she held various executive operations and financial management roles during her 13 years of tenure. When she came to Brown Advisory Seto says she was “given a seat at the table” which is a form of inclusion that is not readily apparent. Not only is that an example of diverse and inclusive thinking Seto says this also provides a sense of belonging which goes hand-in-hand with DEI to create diversity equity inclusion and belonging (DEIB).

“Just being at the table doesn’t mean you feel like you belong. You have to feel like you matter. I’ve been able to show that my skills matter and at Brown Advisory I’m part of the equitable decision making process” Seto explains. “Belonging is something that goes to everyone no matter their role.” It’s these concepts that Seto hopes those who attend DISRUPTION! will be able to use in their own DEIB efforts.

“The demographics of this country are changing. We are becoming more diverse and we’re serving a more diverse population. We have to think about that in all we’re doing” Seto says. “This is an economic imperative. This is the morally right thing to do and this makes economic sense because if we don’t keep up we’ll become obsolete. The world is changing around us and geographical boundaries are becoming less significant.”

During her talk Seto says she will hone in on Brown Advisory’s “4 Cs” which means client first colleague driven community focused and culture led. She explains that the corporate culture at Brown Advisory is one built around making a positive and material difference in the lives of their clients. It’s that culture that allows room for education to prepare colleagues for evolving client needs.

By incorporating DEI and bringing that different perspective to Brown Advisory’s strategies Seto and her team provide endowments and foundations clients with mission-aligned solutions. She says the client demand pushes Brown Advisory to be more inclusive in a manner that helps make them a better investor and a better community leader.

Seto explains that people may think about their portfolio and investments without thinking about diversity and inclusion. “And that can be a lost opportunity” Seto says. “When you have diverse managers in your portfolio it can enhance your returns.” In addition she points out that Brown Advisory is greatly supportive of colleague volunteerism. Seto herself serves on the board of directors of several non-profits including the Heifetz International Music Institute and Creative Alliance.

“At the end of the day you need to show up. And if you can show up with resources such as connections so you can introduce the people in your organization to someone who can bring additional help. I believe in a multi-faceted model when it comes to helping” Seto says.

Tanya Terrell BGE

Director Corporate Community Impact

By Alex Keown

After years of working in the non-profit sector Tanya Terrell director of corporate community impact at Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) has brought new insights into strengthening the relationship between company and communities across Maryland.

In her position at BGE Terrell is playing a key role in the company’s support of diversity equity and inclusion programs and initiatives. As head of corporate community impact Terrell is responsible for overseeing the company’s workforce development and corporate relations efforts throughout central Maryland. She approaches this with a strong sense of responsibility particularly since her efforts are aimed at enhancing BGE’s impact on underserved communities.

She explains that largely a business’ success is based on its ability to meet the needs of customers. She notes that customer needs can go beyond a simple product such as gas and electricity that BGE provides. She says it’s important to think broader and think about shared goals that center on equity and sustainability. To truly understand those needs outreach is necessary and that can be best accomplished through the lens of diversity equity and inclusion.

When she was a leader in the non-profit space Terrell worked closely with BGE and gained deep insights into the company’s DEI culture. She says she believes in what BGE hoped to accomplish then and continues to aim for today. Because she came to the company from a non-corporate background she says her own diverse perspective is valued by her colleagues at BGE which reaffirms her sense of belonging with the company.

Terrell shares that DEI is a core value not only for BGE but for herself individually. She notes that diversity equity and inclusion are three distinct terms with three distinct meanings. Terrell says that the three terms operate collectively but they should not be combined and diminished into one concept.

“DEI is three lenses and companies should have strategies that work with all three definitions in mind” Terrell says. She adds that there is significant work that can be done across the city and nation to ensure that diversity equity and inclusion are woven into all aspects of corporate and community planning.

Terrell will serve as one of the keynote speakers for the I95 Business DISRUPTION! conference and examine how implementing effective DEI programs can not only help a business grow but also positively impact the overall community.

“We stress that the business community should think about community as a partnership… that community is their partner and we should be responsive in a way that it (DEI) can advance shared goals” Terrell says. “I love Baltimore and I recognize it has some challenges. Since we are part of the community and share goals we have to think about ways to address those challenges.”

Terrell who previously served as chief operating officer of The Leadership a Baltimore-based not-for-profit organization aimed at fostering relationships between civic leaders says focusing on ways in which businesses and communities are able to come together can “move the needle” on some long-term conditions that affect the community some of which were highlighted by the death of Freddie Gray in 2015 and the civil unrest in 2020 sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. As someone who has a vested interest in fostering positive relationships between her company and the community Terrell says she is interested in learning about partnerships that have seen a quantifiable and transformative impact from a focus on DEI. Those kinds of stories are something she is excited to hear about from other panelists participating in the DISRUPTION! conference as well as from participants who will have their own insights to share.

“Every time I’m with my corporate peers and colleagues I learn so much. I’m hoping to learn more from thought leaders who are trying to marry the concept of DEI with community. This is a network of peers that we can learn from. There are businesses on different paths along the DEI journey. I want to build those networks” she says.

Raymone Jackson T. Rowe Price

Global Head of Diversity Equity & Inclusion

By Lisa Baldino

“DEI is really an intertwining of meaningful connections within communities” says Raymone Jackson T. Rowe Price’s Global Head of Diversity Equity & Inclusion. It is this principle on which Jackson builds the foundation for identifying and selecting members for his team and guiding diversity equity and inclusion within T. Rowe Price. “If people have healthy and strong experiences where they live work and play there is a sense of community that is special to them. As a result this community fosters a culture of belonging and generates stronger business outcomes.”

As a top-level executive and community champion Jackson explains that when underserved groups and communities have access to financial resources it puts them on a more even playing field. “Studies have shown that over time community engagement and participation increases” he notes. “By working with residents across communities especially in underserved areas T. Rowe Price can help provide financial support where it’s most needed and in turn help build stronger more diverse talent.”

Jackson says the company aims to model diversity in its own organization by hiring great talent for each position and fostering engagement among team members. As diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) roles have become more prevalent at large and small companies alike businesses are learning ways to intertwine meaningful connections that are integrated into the corporate culture. Despite its recent increase in awareness Jackson maintains that programs for DEIB have been ongoing for years at companies across the globe albeit at a lower profile. In today’s marketplace he says one job opening for a DEI role will have at least 20-30 candidates. They come from human resources backgrounds social justice

or legal.

Jackson’s experience is built on his active participation on a variety of Boards of Directors as well as his corporate experience. Prior to joining T. Rowe Price he was the national diversity officer with Morgan Stanley as well as a 20-year veteran of Northwestern Mutual. There he held positions in technology corporate strategy field distribution and human resources while leading enterprise diversity and inclusion programs.

T. Rowe Price offers opportunities in all levels of leadership roles and Jackson confirms that the firm’s teams are diverse – including Black and Hispanic employees LGBTQ+ women and those with disabilities throughout its employee ranks. One of Jackson’s goals is to encourage more sponsorships of early and mid-level talent. “We found that oftentimes the early and mid-level talent is over-mentored and under-sponsored” Jackson comments. “We’re aiming for more sponsorships of talent as they navigate their career and ambition. This would further complement the mentoring provided by their managers.”

T. Rowe Price also encourages diversity and inclusion with clients. In investments Jackson says diversity within a portfolio has long been important. That same concept is true when it comes to teams. Research has shown that diverse teams deliver stronger engagement creativity and business outcomes.

In addition to his corporate background Jackson has made his mark in the DEI sector. He was awarded the Patriot Award from the Department of Defense in recognition of his commitment to diversity and inclusion. He has also been Black Enterprise magazine’s “Top Black Executive in Corporate Diversity” several years for his commitment to supporting the career success of others.

He holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee and an MBA; a certificate in real estate from the Associates in Commercial Real Estate Program at Marquette University a CLU designation from The American College and ACS and FLMI designations from Life Office Management Association. He is also a Certified Master Coach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYXUuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMy10b3AtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1tdXR1YWwtZnVuZHMtMTIwMDEyNzgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Top-Performing Mutual Funds to Consider for Your Retirement Portfolio,"Investing in mutual funds for retirement is never too late.

“We were already a leader in the console and PC space and we believe we had already the best collection of intellectual property in the space.

Consolidation is running rampant in the $198 billion gaming sector. Microsoft wants to buy out Activision-Blizzard shares for nearly $70 billion and Take-Two themselves just acquired Zynga in a huge $12.7 billion deal. There's reports Tencent is on the hunt for majority stakes too. High-stakes Western games publishers are in the potential crosshair including EA and GTA giant Take-Two Interactive.

Interestingly enough Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick gives a rather level-headed answer on a possible buyout. ""Not really [I don't worry about being acquired.] We're a public company and all public companies are potentially available and if someone shows up with up with a meaningful cash offer at a meaningful premium every public company has to engage"" Zelnick said in a recent interview with TheWrap.

""We like being independent. We've created an enormous amount of value as an independent company we're not at a scale where we are a major in this business (there aren't many of them). Depending on what happens we're either the #2 or #3 developer & publisher worldwide.

""That's a pretty good position to be in.""

TheWrap CEO Sharon Waxman interviewer: ""You could argue that also makes you a target because you fill a need for another large company.""

Zelnick responds by saying it makes sense for Take-Two to stay as it is because a big company possibly the likes of Tencent could disrupt the critical creative process that Take-Two's business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL3JvY2tzdGFyLWdhbWVzLXBhcmVudC1leWVzLTQwLXN1cmdlLWluLXNoYXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockstar Games Parent Eyes 40% Surge in Shares,"Take-Two Interactive could see its shares surge at least 40% as it overcomes challenges prevalent throughout the gaming industry according to Goldman Sachs.

The New York-based company that owns major video game publishers including Rockstar Games and 2K has posted underwhelming profits in FY2022 following a surge of interest and spending at the height of the pandemic due mainly to supply chain disruptions and the ongoing semiconductor shortage.

But Take-Two is poised to return to pre-pandemic levels as it plans to launch new gaming titles including the next installment of Rockstar’s “Grand Theft Auto” series. The latest title “GTA V” has sold nearly 170 million units worldwide since its 2013 release.

Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target of Take-Two shares from $131 to $165 .

. So far in 2022 shares of the company are down around 34%.

In May Take-Two completed its acquisition of mobile game developer Zynga the company behind “FarmVille” and “Words with Friends” for $12.7 billion. The deal was funded with $2.7 billion in financing from JPMorgan Chase Take-Two’s balance sheet and a debt issuance.

Take-Two also added to its mobile-related properties in September with the acquisition of Storemaven a platform that specializes in app store optimization.

Take-Two generated $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal Q1 up 36% year-over-year.

Given that this game is expected to arrive some time in 2025 may the years be kind to fans of Rockstar Games.

While Grand Theft Auto VI was affirmed to be in ""active development"" in early 2022 the leak has done catastrophic damage to the image of the game with a fair few erroneously thinking that the footage was from a recent stage in development.

Tide yourselves over with these wins and fails from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online here!

﻿ ﻿

Apparently the leak shows slices of the game from about a year ago and Grand Theft Auto VI is in a much more orderly state now I would imagine. Still it's estimated that the game will come out in 2025 and if Bully 2 follows suit it might be a few years after that. Tez2 the insider who suggested that Grand Theft Auto VI will have single-player DLC said that the game has had two years of active development but was shelved at an undisclosed point.

The hope is therefore that Rockstar Games could pick up where it left off after the release and support of the next Grand Theft Auto game with a lot of work on Bully 2 already under its belt. Naturally Bully fans are wary owing to the fact that another leaker claimed that there would be a Bully 2 reveal at The Game Awards 2021 which came to nothing. With any scoop of this sort we'll have to wait and see whether it is confirmed by official sources or melts away in the sun.

The event is to be held at Trojena a planned city and resort in the mountainous region near the Gulf of Aqaba coast. Trojena is part of Saudi Arabia’s $500 billion futuristic NEOM project.

The Asian Winter Games may merely be a warmup act for Saudi Arabia.

The country is reportedly leading a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup with Egypt and Greece.

The move would likely force the tournament to follow the lead of next month’s World Cup in Qatar and take place near the end of the year. Temperatures in the Saudi capital of Riyadh regularly top 100 degrees from May to September.

(Tapestry) has dismantled its data silos and modernized its Tapestry Data Exchange system using cloud and fully managed solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Before undergoing a full digital transformation of its Data Exchange and infrastructure the company used an on-premises infrastructure which was limited in its ability to scale across its global operations. By securely migrating to the cloud Tapestry was looking to expand its data science efforts by building out its machine learning (ML) capabilities and using APIs to deliver data across the supply chain.

“We offer tens of thousands of products across our brands” says Josh Ainsley senior director and head of data science at Tapestry. “Being able to forecast demand is one of the big areas that we focus on.” For instance Tapestry strives to accurately predict how many products it needs to ship to each of its stores so that it can optimize shipping costs and avoid surpluses or shortages in inventory. It also uses ML to segment customers detect similar products and identify bottlenecks in its supply chain.

Investing in its data science by migrating to the cloud

Tapestry consists of three fashion brands: Coach kate spade new york and Stuart Weitzman which have 1500 retail locations globally. Originally Tapestry was known as Coach Inc. However it changed its corporate name in 2017 and added the Stuart Weitzman and kate spade new york brands to its portfolio of brands through acquisitions in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Because of these acquisitions Tapestry’s data systems and infrastructure were fragmented and disparate making it difficult to use the full breadth of its data to unlock key insights and analytics that would give the company a 360-degree view of its customers. Tapestry takes customer data privacy seriously. Customer data it collects is managed in accordance with regional state or local privacy regulations. Tapestry Data Exchange is also used to process General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act requests it receives from its customers and help it to quickly respond to new privacy regulations globally and deliver a privacy-first-oriented data solution.

As the basis for its forecasting ML and data storage the company created the Tapestry Data Exchange which processes and stores data across 100 systems and acts as a single source of truth. This Data Exchange also serves as the foundation for Tapestry’s ML capabilities. In 2018 the company decided to modernize its Data Exchange system by adopting a set of scalable cloud services using AWS. “We wanted to build strong foundations for our data science” says Fabio Luzzi vice president of data science and engineering at Tapestry. “So as we move forward we can scale develop new data products and deploy them at scale.”

Using APIs to transfer data across its Data Exchange system

The Tapestry Data Exchange system consists of three primary pillars: a data lake a massively parallel processing system and an operational data store (ODS). To transfer data across these three environments Tapestry adopted Amazon API Gateway a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create publish maintain monitor and secure APIs at virtually any scale. Using Amazon API Gateway the company can deliver data to its applications such as its point-of-sale systems almost instantaneously. “We get half a million API calls per day” says Muhammad Chaudhry head of data engineering at Tapestry. “Our average response time is 200 ms.” During busy shopping times the company has scaled to over 1.5 million API calls daily peaking at 10000 API calls per minute.

For its data lake Tapestry uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Its data lake stores 200 TB of both structured and unstructured data from all three of its brands. To prepare its data for ML models the company runs its data through multiple data processing services. During the first stage Tapestry cleans its data using AWS Glue a simple scalable and serverless data integration service. Then the company pulls its data into its massively parallel processing system using Snowflake Data Cloud an Independent Software Vendor solution offered in AWS Marketplace. Using Snowflake Data Cloud as a core data processing engine the company can model and process customer product and other enterprise datasets with elasticity. In this stage Tapestry also uses Amazon Redshift—which helps companies accelerate their time to insights with fast easy and secure cloud data warehousing at scale—to model and further process its data.

For the final leg of its data processing Tapestry pushes its data to its ODS using APIs. On any given day Tapestry processes about 15 TB of data through its ODS. To power its ODS the company uses Amazon EMR which gives companies the ability to easily run and scale Apache Spark Hive Presto and other big data workloads. “Working in the cloud helped us achieve two things” says Justin Bussen vice president of data engineering and data solutions at Tapestry. “First we were able to get rid of data silos that existed because we previously hosted our infrastructure in different places. Second we can scale our resources whether it’s database power or compute power to accelerate the completion of tasks.”

Advancing its analytics using ML on AWS

When its data has been fully prepared Tapestry uses Amazon SageMaker to build train and deploy ML models for virtually any use case with fully managed infrastructure tools and workflows. Tapestry has built several ML models to perform near-real-time customer segmentation product ideation and supply chain optimization. “Using AWS it’s simple to deploy our ML models at scale and infuse our data across different touch points in the customer experience” says Luzzi.

For instance the company can predict how well a product will sell by comparing it to other similar products that it has offered in the past. To accomplish this task Tapestry uses embeddings for each of its products which are sets of numerals that represent the physical characteristics of a product. Using these embeddings Tapestry can accurately predict how well a new product will perform along with how many units it needs to stock at each of its store locations. Tapestry also uses ML to identify VIP customers and bolster its ecommerce.

By running its ML and analytics on AWS Tapestry has deepened its data science capabilities and gained a better understanding of customer behavior. “We can automatically evaluate several transactions and give our employees insights into our customers on a daily basis” says Ainsley. “That isn’t something we could do without using AWS as our cloud provider.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNibG1lZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RhcGVzdHJ5cy1hcHByb2FjaC1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tapestry's Approach to Climate Change,"Tapestry's Approach to Climate Change

Oct 11 2022 3:15 PM ET

Originally published in Tapestry's 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report

As one of the world’s greatest challenges and global disrupters climate change impacts us all. It exacerbates natural disasters threatens supply chains and disproportionately harms marginalized communities contributing to socio- economic inequalities. Tapestry and our brands are responding to the urgent call for collective action and doing our part to mitigate climate-related risks to our business our people and the communities where we live and work.

We are aligning our business strategies with the international consensus – outlined in the Paris Agreement – that we must limit global warming to below 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. In early FY2022 we signed onto the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C.

Read more about our management of climate- related risks and opportunities in our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS

We aim to reduce our GHG emissions as part of our efforts to address climate change. In 2019 Tapestry set goals to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 20% below 2017 levels and reduce Scope 3 emissions from freight shipping 20% below 2017 levels both by 2025. As of FY2021 we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 6% and Scope 3 emissions from upstream freight shipping by 28%. We are currently working on setting increased targets for Scope 3 emissions and are expanding our Scope 3 emissions inventory to likely include upstream and downstream transportation business travel emissions from purchased goods and services and other relevant categories as outlined by the GHG protocol.

Tapestry’s emissions across Scope 2 and 3 increased from FY2020 to FY2021 as our business activities started to return to normal following the initial impacts of COVID-19. As we work towards achieving our GHG emissions reduction goals and a net-zero value chain we know it will take the full participation of our business our brands and our supply chain partners. In FY2022 we aim to host trainings for our suppliers on establishing GHG emissions reduction goals in line with SBTi for their operations.

ENERGY AND RENEWABLES

Tapestry is committed to procuring 100% renewable electricity in our stores offices and fulfillment centers by 2025. We work with a third-party energy procurement team to source renewable energy in our retail stores in deregulated electricity markets using green-e certified renewable energy credits (RECs). In FY2021 our RECs covered 21% of our electricity consumption across our operations in North America which is equivalent to 9% renewable electricity globally. Our total REC purchases from 2017 to 2021 were 20522 MWH.

In addition to purchasing renewable energy we are working to improve energy efficiency and reduce overall electricity usage wherever possible. Our global headquarters at Hudson Yards is LEED Platinum certified and our kate spade new york office and Jacksonville distribution center both earned LEED Silver certifications.

Renewable Energy in Our Supply Chain

We seek to promote renewable energy consumption across our supply chain. 78% of our suppliers who completed the Higg FEM energy module and had their data verified by a third-party agency achieved a Level 1 rating in the Energy and GHG module and 22% achieved a Level 2 rating.8 The data provided through the Higg FEM combined with data we received from tanneries audited by the LWG allowed us to analyze our supply chain energy consumption data broken down by source and usage and provided us with a baseline to measure our supply chain improvements year-over-year.

In early FY2022 we began engaging with our suppliers one-on-one to help set energy reduction targets and increase adoption of renewable energy. As we work to set a science-based target we plan to include additional Scope 3 categories in our GHG footprint and plan to report on that information in future reports.

The 55-year-old businesswoman was found dead in the apartment on Park Avenue by her housekeeping staff at around 10:20 am. The police reported that there was no sign of a break-in struggle or burglary.

About Kate Spade Death & How She Dies

Kate Spade death was concluded to be a suicide as she was found hanging in her apartment. Police say that there was a note in the room which was addressed to Kate Spade’s daughter. Later Kate Spade’s husband and co-founder of the brand Andy Spade told the press that Kate Spade had been struggling with mental health issues for a long time. He said that she suffered severely from issues like anxiety and depression for years. She had been working with doctors as a part of her treatment but it was very unfortunate that the negative part of her got hold of her will. Kate Spade was estimated to have a net worth of $200 Million at the time of Kate Spade death.

How Famous is Kate Spade?

Kate Spade Known for its iconic floral designs and bright-colored handbags Kate Spade New York was a brand developed by Kate Spade herself and her husband Andy Spade that took the fashion industry by storm. It created a revolution in the field of handbags in the 90s. Even though it started only as a handbag store Kate Spade is now a fashion brand with different items like jewelry perfume accessories and home decor which can be found in almost all retail stores across the country. The brand owns about 140 retail and outlet stores in the U.S and more than 170 stores abroad.

The handbag brand became a whooping sensation in the US by the 90s. The idea for the company was by Katherine Noel Brosnahan who later came to be known as Kate Spade. Katherine was born in Kansas City Missouri. Katherine graduated High School from St Teresa’s Academy and then joined the University of Kansas. From the University of Kansas she transferred to Arizona State University. Kate Spade majored in Journalism at the University. During her studies Katherine met Andy Spade who used to work in a clothing store in Pheonix. They became co-workers and eventually partners -both in life and business.

Upon the completion of their course the couple moved to New York where they eventually started their business. It was with Andy’s investment from his savings that they started production of their handbags. It was also Andy who suggested the name Kate Spade for the newly launched brand. Kate’s bags were an instant hit among women. They were attracted by the sophisticated look and the price range of the bag was also affordable unlike the luxury brands like Louis Vitton and Burberry. The bags took over New York very easily and once Anna Wintour the editor-in-chief for the world-famous fashion magazine Vogue recalled that it was impossible to pass a block without spotting a Kate Spade bag.

About Kate Spade New York

The company which started with handbags eventually started to branch into other areas of fashion like shoes perfumes accessories jewelry and even home decor items. The venture Kate Spade also started two other lines Kate Spade Saturday and Jack Spade. While the former focused on more casual handbags and apparel the latter focused on men’s leather goods and accessories. Both these shops were closed down eventually in 2015.

In 1999 Kate Spade sold a 56% stake in her business to the Neiman Marcus group. The Neiman group is an American integrated luxury retailer which is based in Dallas Texas. It was done so that she could expand the area of her business and grow into a much bigger chain. After selling the stake in her company Kate in 2004 launched a new range of home decor under the name ‘Kate Spade at Home’. Later in 2006 Kate Spade sold the remaining 44% share to the Neiman Marcus Group. The company was then handed over a few times to different managements before it finally landed with Tapestry Inc of which Kate Spade is still a part.

It was following her birth that Kate Spade sold her remaining share in the company. She told that she wanted to take care of her daughter and take some years off from work.

Before her death in 2018 Kate Spade launched a new brand under the name Frances Valentine for luxury footwear and handbags. The company launched a collection named ‘Love Katy’ in her memory. The company is all set to build up on the plans and ideas of Kate Spade that she gathered through her years of experience in the field."

If you want to skip our industry primer and head on to the top five stocks in this list then take a look at the 5 Best Pipeline and MLP Stocks to Buy.

Taking stock of the current economic situation in the U.S. and the globe the primary headache for investors companies and governments is inflation. The key tool in central banks' belt to deal with inflation which is at decades high levels is raising interest rates. While these do end up bringing down the prices they also make capital hard to access and result in a tougher business environment.

In this environment investing in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and the broader pipeline sector can be worthwhile. Data gathered by Alerian shows that midstream MLPs do tend to outperform real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities in a high interest rate environment with significant differences in rate returns when ten year treasury yields are high. Additionally as of December 2021 MLPs that are part of the Alerian AMZ index have posted an average yield of 7.7% over the past ten years which is nearly double the yield of REITs and utilities.

Alongside the high interest rate environment the tightening demand for oil and the surge in global oil prices as the Russian invasion of Ukraine culls supply and fears of a global recession compel OPEC+ to keep prices high for protecting balance sheets further investment in oil exploration will only grow particularly in the U.S. Finally another key benefit of MLPs is the fact that their income is not taxed at the corporate level. Instead it is passed through as dividends to the investor for a nice and comforting benefit during these turbulent times.

All these factors create a favorable environment for investing in MLPs and pipeline firms and with them in mind we have compiled a list of some firms that merit a deeper look. Out of these the well known names are Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP).

The firms were evaluated through a variety of factors such as their financial performance dividends market dynamics and hedge fund investments gauged via Insider Monkey's 895 fund survey for this year's second quarter.

Known for having a discerning eye for trends while anticipating the needs of the retailer’s shoppers Sando has risen steadily through Target’s hierarchy holding various leadership positions in merchandising planning product design and development.

As the 2022 Top Women In Store Brand honoree in the Marketing and Merchandising category Sando and Target continue to build off the retailer’s long history of developing unique private label products sold under various own brands as well as teaming with well-known designers for exclusive products.

“Design has always been in our DNA and it’s highly valued throughout the organization” Sando told Store Brands. “You see this influence in our work with our owned brands and in how we work with national brands and our talented design partners. We are constantly evolving in this space to surprise and delight our guests.”

Sando credits Target’s success in private label to its world class owned-brand design sourcing and management capabilities with teams at its headquarters and around the world working closely with vendor partners to deliver products.

In recent years Target has continued to build on its long-standing reputation with the launch of several high-profile private label brands including the Kindfull line of dog and cat food in 2021. Additionally she has also fostered relationships with designers and brands including Christian Robinson LEGO and Tabitha Brown as part of an effort to bring exclusive products to her shoppers.

Among the private label brands that standout to Sando are Cat & Jack and Hearth & Hand with Magnolia.

“Cat & Jack is one of our first owned brands when we set out to reimagine our assortment several years ago and it’s been incredibly successful. It was built on core values and created with a distinct personality.”

She continued “The second one that stands out is Hearth & Hand with Magnolia. We saw an opportunity in the modern farmhouse aesthetic and thought that Chip and Joanna Gaines would be perfect partners to create this brand with us. I remember our very first meeting and how we talked about our dreams and seeing the guest love what this brand has generated has been a real highlight” she said.

In an industry that sees continual change and executives moving from company to company Sando is also unique in that she has remained at one retailer for more than a quarter-century.

“I’ve stayed with Target for 25 years because of the people and the work we do together every day to deliver joy to our guests” she said. This is a team that leads with big minds and big hearts. That was true when I started at Target in 1997 and it remains so today. I learn so much from a team that has come to Target to discover innovate and deliver programs and products that make people happy. It has been a gift and I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else.”

As Sando continues her career at Target she also serves as inspiration to future generations of women entering retail.

Her advice is simple. “Lean into your superpowers. I truly believe you are successful when you are happy and you are happy when you are being true to yourself” she said. “I went through phases where I compared myself to others and focused on my deficiencies. When I let go of that and leaned into my strengths I started having more fun developed stronger connections with my colleagues and was given additional opportunities to grow and learn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxpbWFya2V0bmV3cy5jb20vYmVoaW5kLWNvdW50ZXIvdGFyZ2V0LW5hbWVzLXByYXQtdmVtYW5hLWNoaWVmLWRpZ2l0YWwtYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Qtb2ZmaWNlci9wZWdneS1wYWNrZXIvbW9uLTEwMTAyMDIyLTA4NTgvMTQzNznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Target Names Prat Vemana as Chief Digital and Product Officer,"MINNEAPOLIS MN

Our latest data analysis ...,"One in five consumers want to see less LGBTQ marketing and advertising according to a newly published survey of 9360 respondents conducted by DISQO a customer experience intelligence platform in partnership with Do The WeRQ a queer advertising advocacy group.

Although rainbow-washing has been a buzzword for several years the new report provides some of the earliest quantitative data we have on the consequences of LGBTQ advertising oversaturation and is both painful and important to announce.

More than a fifth of respondents (21.73%) stated their preference that LGBTQ+ people or issues be included less often in advertising. The sentiment was lowest in respondents ages 18 to 24 clocking in at 13.7% and increased with each successive age range with nearly 34% of people over the age of 65 wanting less LGBTQ+ visibility. However the overall 21.73% figure is down over five points from last year the first year the survey was conducted.

Notably of respondents who are part of the community 3.25% of people who identified as LGBTQ and 21.29% of people who identified as “unsure or questioning” said they wanted less LGBTQ advertising.

We’re again disappointed by the number but we aren’t surprised. The conversation about LGBTQ equality has ratcheted up in the last year as we face waves of anti-LGBTQ legislation in a number of states and attempts to roll back rights and reduce visibility.

The year-over-year progress shown in the data is remarkable but some of the shifts may be temporary due to the survey’s data collection time frame which began a few weeks after the Supreme Court’s draft overturning Roe v. Wade leaked this spring activating discourse on whether the right to same-sex marriage would fall next.

Rainbow-washing is a proactive effort to appeal to the queer community and its allies particularly during Pride Month and can often come across as performative. Campaigns are sometimes used as a way for corporations to “balance the scales” and play both sides while they continue to donate to or do business with anti-LGBTQ causes or public figures as whistleblowers regularly reveal.

A lot can also be learned through a Google search regarding donations from top corporations to various political figures and that information is more readily available and aggregated by citizens activists and advocacy groups. Increasingly as consumers we have no tolerance for duplicity because we know we can get our need for products and services met by other brands that are doing things differently.

Companies need to strike a balance between LGBTQ visibility and organizational integrity.

With limitless access to information in the technological age consumers are super-sleuthing brands to identify the disconnect between their words and their actions.

The queer economy is now the fastest-growing minority market in America and corporations are attempting to appeal to LGBTQ consumers and their allies particularly Gen Zers the segment of the population born between 1997 and 2012.

A whopping 20.8% of Gen Z Americans identify as LGBT according to a Gallup poll published earlier this year. This identification ratio is far higher than other generations: Millennials identified as 10.5% LGBT and the national average increased to 7.1% up from 5.6% in 2020 and 3.5% a decade ago as sexuality and gender identity become increasingly destigmatized.

As young people enter the workforce overall LGBTQ purchasing power—a market referred to as “pink money”—will rise dramatically. However many corporations’ strategies remain hollow and insincere with some companies promoting LGBTQ solidarity while simultaneously donating to anti-LGBTQ causes or politicians an example of speaking out of both sides of their mouths.

The impact? Virtue-signaling ads that can deter both queer and non-queer consumers. Visibility is certainly important but to play the long game this data tells us that corporations need to internally huddle and realign and match LGBTQ engagement efforts with overall brand values.

Companies have oversaturated Pride Month with performative advertising and the noise of these campaigns is holding back the LGBTQ community’s quest for tolerance. It also means pink dollars are seeking out brands that actually stand with queer people rather than ones that play both sides.

We want action alliance and integrity. Between whisperings of Obergefell v. Hodges being overturned “Don’t Say Gay” bills cropping up in state legislatures across the country and digital harassment campaigns reaching extremist territory we need brands on our side more than ever before.

Companies often blunder in queer marketing efforts because they make a superficial blanket statement about all LGBTQ people and the campaigns are rarely relevant to their target demographic.

Pink money is on the rise and queer consumers want to hear from spokespeople from their own community. Empower queer voices and retain LGBTQ talent for a more authentic approach.

This is where influencer marketing shines: You’ll financially empower the voice of someone in a marginalized community and simultaneously make a brand statement that resonates with consumers especially Gen Zers.

Companies will have to change the way they behave. A more evolved approach one that aligns a company’s brand values with its giving efforts will engage the right audiences with the right message including LGBTQ consumers and their allies.

P2G uses electrolysis of water to convert renewable energy into hydrogen for storage and transportation to where it is needed. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is seen as a highly promising conversion method as it is reacts rapidly to power fluctuations and is highly durable. However PEM uses iridium as the catalyst in its electrodes. Practical application requires reduction of the iridium used.

Toshiba developed an iridium oxide nanosheet laminated catalyst that reduced the iridium requirement to 1/10 in 2017. The company has now developed large-scale production technology that deposits the catalyst over a maximum area of 5m2 at one time. This advance could drive forward the early commercialization of P2G for large-scale power conversion; Toshiba is aiming for commercialization in FY2023 or after.





PEM uses a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that integrates the electrolyte membrane and electrode.

Large-scale hydrogen conversion of electricity requires a large number of MEAs and forecasts anticipate a market scale of approximately $580 million by 2028.

However the MEA electrode relies on a large amount of iridium to ensure sufficient electrolytic efficiency. Iridium is one of the rarest of precious metals. Annual global production is in the region of 7 to 10 tons far less than the 200 tons of platinum and it costs four to five times more. Forming electrodes requires a uniform coating of fine iridium oxide particles but reducing the iridium oxide results in uneven application and non-uniform reactions that degrade water electrolysis performance.

Toshiba’s multilayer catalyst uses a new sputtering technology to deposit alternate layers of iridium oxide nanosheet films and void layers. In sputtering ions such as argon bombard a deposition material the target in a vacuum and deposit the ejected particles on a substrate.





In Toshiba’s process iridium is the target and a thin film of iridium oxide is formed by injecting oxygen as the target is deposited on the substrate. Thickness control is at the nanometer level realizing deposition of uniform iridium oxide layers of with a smaller amount of iridium.





Structures of Oxide Nanosheet and MEA developed by Toshiba

Using Toshiba’s laminated nanosheet structure in the catalyst layer successfully reduces the required iridium to 1/10 while maintaining the water electrolysis performance. It also significantly expands the deposition surface area. As sputtering is conducted in a vacuum deposition on a large area is difficult.





Comparative efficiency of powdered and sputtered catalysts by iridium load

However by modifying the deposition distribution ratio for multiple metal targets including iridium and the oxygen input level Toshiba has successfully developed a large-scale production technology that realizes catalyst deposition on an area of up to 5m 2 at a time.

In collaboration with Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation Toshiba has built MEA prototypes with electrodes based on the developed technology and has begun evaluation testing with a water electrolyzer manufacturer. Going forward the Company will improve the yield and quality toward mass production of MEA aiming for commercialization in FY2023 or after."

TFX,Teleflex,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1kZGlvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ldXJvbG9naWNhbC91cm9sb2dpc3Qtc3VydmV5LWdvb2QtZm9yLXRlbGVmbGV4LWJhZC1mb3ItYXhvbmljc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Urologist Survey Good for Teleflex Bad for Axonics,"Medtech analysts at Needham & Co. surveyed 25 urologists that reported doing a median of 30 sacral neuromodulation procedures a year. While the survey implications weren't necessarily bad for Axonics the firm ultimately decided to downgrade its rating on the company's stock from ""buy"" to ""hold"" noting that the stock seems fairly valued at this point.

Medtronic pioneered the sacral neuromodulation market more than 20 years ago with its InterStim device used to treat various bladder and bowel conditions. Axonics Modulation Technologies came along to challenge the market leader in 2019 with FDA approval for a rechargeable version of a similar device. This triggered an ugly war of words between the two companies as well as a drawn out patent battle.

Here are some key takeaways from Needham & Co.'s recent urologist survey and what the analysts think the results imply for the sacral neuromodulation market and for Axonics.

Urologists surveyed told the firm they expect Axonics sacral neuromodulation devices to increase from 37.4% of their procedures over the last 12 months to 41.6% of their procedures over the next 12 months.

The urologists surveyed also expect their sacral neuromodulation procedure volumes to increas by 2% over the next 12 months.

Together these results imply that the Irvine CA-based company could see sacral neuromodulation growth of 14% over the next 12 months which compares to consensus 2023 estimated growth for the space of 24%.

It will be difficult for Axonics to drive upside to the consensus 2023 revenue estimate Needham & Co.'s Mike Matson wrote in a report issued this week.

FDA approved Axonics' recharge-free sacral neuromodulation implantable neurostimulator called F15 earlier this year. That approval closed an important portfolio gap for the company but also came on the heels of Medtronic winning FDA approval for InterStim X the next generation of the company's InterStim portfolio's recharge-free device.

The Axonics F15 recharge-free sacral neuromodulation implantable neurostimulator runs on a primary cell battery and is designed to last more than 15 years at typical stimulation parameters and more than 20 years at lower energy settings. The device is 20% smaller than Medtronic's InterStim X device according to Axonics and has MRI compatability. The F15 also comes with a recharge-free key fob freaturing the company's SmartMRI technology and an algorithm recommends optimal stimulation parameters based on intraoperative responses.

""We believe that [Axonics'] F15 launch has allowed it to gain share from [Medtronic] and has served as a significant growht driver"" Matson wrote. ""We believe that this has been a key factor in the year-to-date outperformance of [Axonics] shares but believe it is now largely reflected in its share price.""

The analyst also noted that Axonics has submitted a premarket approval application for the fourth generation of its R15 (the rechargable device) that requires less frequent charging (once every six months as opposed to once every month). Still Matson said he does not expect this to be as meaningful of a growth driver as the F15 has been for the company. All of this leads the firm to believe it will be difficult for Axonics to drive upside to the consensus 2023 revenue estimate Matson noted justifying the downgrade.

Urologists still favor Teleflex UroLift

Needham & Co.'s survey of urologists has positive implications for Teleflex and its UroLift System which is used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

""Despite all the concerns about Teleflex's UroLift we believe that the results show that the procedure is highly regarded by urologists and that it should continue to see double-digit growth (admittedly below the hyper-growth seen in prior years)"" Matson wrote in a separate report published Monday.

The analyst also noted that the ""sharp pull-back"" in Teleflex shares has made the compay particularly compelling at its current valuation level.

Out of the five types of BPH procedures included in Needham & Co.'s survey the analyst noted that UroLift is the most commonly used. UrolLift market share is expected to increase by 1.1% (from 41.2% to 42.3%) over the next 12 months. Respondents expect to perform 10% more UroLift procedures over the next 12 months. While consensus 2023 estimates for Teleflex already imply 10% UroLift growth ($364 million in 2023 compared to $332 million in 2022) the analyst said buy-side expectations are lower than this.

Matson also points out that UroLift was launched in Japan in April and is expected to launch in China later this year and a reimbursement update in France starts later this year as well. So the company should see additional UroLift growth from new adopters in the United States and from international markets.

​​​​​Need​ham & Co. asked the urologists to rate five BPH procedures in terms of six characteristics on a scale of 1 to 7 (where 1 is very bad and 7 is very good) and UroLift was rated the highest across all six criteria including favorable reimbursement/practice profitability ease of the procedure safety/complication rate and patient preference/feedback.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL2lubm8vc3Rvcmllcy9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvc3RhbmRhcmQtYmFyaWF0cmljcy1jbG9zZXMtc2FsZS10ZWxlZmxleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Standard Bariatrics $300M sale complete; exit stands among top three largest in Cincinnati region,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/inno/stories/news/2022/10/10/standard-bariatrics-closes-sale-teleflex.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL2lubm8vc3Rvcmllcy9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvc3RhbmRhcmQtYmFyaWF0cmljcy1jbG9zZXMtc2FsZS10ZWxlZmxleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Whether we’re in a coffee shop a hotel room or a plane at 35000 feet chances are that we’ll be able to enjoy Internet access at reasonable speeds. But despite this constant connectedness we still manage to misplace our keys and forget where we left our smartphones.

New connectivity technologies are promising to have dramatic impacts on both of these scenarios. Wi-Fi 7 the next iteration of the established Wi-Fi standard is designed for extremely high throughput. In its final form Wi-Fi 7 is predicted to meet or even exceed current wired speeds making it ideal for VR and other high-bandwidth applications.

And even though Ultra Wideband (UWB) doesn’t fall under the Wi-Fi umbrella you can think of it as a companion wireless technology that will enhance and complement Wi-Fi. Not only will UWB make our keys easier to find (or maybe harder to lose) it could potentially replace our keys altogether!

There will be a lot riding on these next-generation technologies and they will push consumer and industrial hardware further than it has ever gone before. Given that semiconductors are the underlying technology that enables these applications it will be critical to test those semiconductor chips during the manufacturing process to ensure quality.

Below we’ll discuss why testing needs to evolve from complex characterization to an effective production-level test creating a symbiotic relationship between the development of technology and the way that technology is tested for real-world use.

The basics of Wi-Fi 7

Wi-Fi 7 better known to engineers as IEEE 802.11be is the next iteration of the global Wi-Fi connectivity standard. Among other things it builds on an enhancement that was first introduced with the current Wi-Fi 6E standard: the 6GHz band. This standard opens up new wireless spectrum on top of the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands that have seen mainstream use since Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) back in 2008. The additional spectrum can help with network congestion and throughput.

But that’s not all that Wi-Fi 7 brings to the table. There are further technologies like automated frequency coordination (AFC) multi-link operation (MLO) and 4K quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) that will either be introduced or improved in this evolution.

AFC goes hand in hand with the 6 GHz band. It will enable Wi-Fi devices to co-exist with other equipment that already makes use of this spectrum including sensitive Department of Defense and NASA satellite communication systems.

MLO capitalizes on the fact that Wi-Fi 7’s 5 and 6 GHz bands are close spectral neighbors. Thanks to MLO mobile phones and IoT devices will be able to simultaneously access multiple wireless channels for greater signal robustness and efficiency.

4K QAM increases the amount of data that can be packed into a transmission by sending overlapping signals that differ in terms of amplitude and phase. Previously Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) allowed one of these signals to have 256 states. 4K QAM by contrast ramps that number up to 4096. Wi-Fi 7 will cement this capability as standard.

These technologies naturally require silicon with more powerful transmit receive and processing functions. Many chips will also feature an ARM processor and more onboard RAM for increased compute capabilities. This means that test processes will need to account for both RF and digital methods to prevent defective chips from reaching consumers as the cost of capturing defects grows considerably with each stage between manufacturing and deployment.

Despite (or because of) the ultimate ubiquity of Wi-Fi 7 devices one prerequisite for testing will include power supplies and serial data communication protocols depending on the application. For example a low-power IoT device in the field will have far different power and connectivity requirements than a high-end smartphone. As a result there will be more variables leading to higher test complexity.

Fig. 1: General architecture schematic of both Wi-Fi 7 and UWB silicon.

The basics of UWB

UWB is a wireless communication technology that’s designed for short-range applications. Its most common and practical use is location tracking with incredibly low latency and high precision otherwise known as micro-positioning. It works by sending pulse-based radio waves between devices and by calculating distance and relative location based on timing. You might think of UWB as a kind of low-cost use-optimized radar.

Although UWB isn’t part of the Wi-Fi standard it is a global standard in its own right: IEEE 802.15.4z. It’s also easy to see how it might be used in conjunction with current and future Wi-Fi iterations. In a congested area mobile devices might be able to leverage UWB to determine the optimal connection point with pinpoint accuracy. Likewise the combination of UWB and Wi-Fi could be used to locate a car in a large parking lot and securely authenticate the approaching driver before unlocking automatically.

Compared to Wi-Fi UWB has a broader spectrum draws less power and makes use of a different (non-QAM) modulation waveform. The chip architecture is therefore a little more complex than Wi-Fi. At the same time there are very similar requirements in terms of its transmit receive and processing functions which are also likely to be carried out by a power-efficient but capable ARM processor. UWB silicon will therefore involve a comparable test platform that is optimized for its unique set of use cases and RF characteristics.

Fig. 2: Power spectral density relative to frequency for Wi-Fi 7 and UWB. Each technology has very different (though complementary) applications and requirements.

Solving Wi-Fi 7 and UWB test pain points

There’s no doubt that new technologies like Wi-Fi 7 and UWB drive global innovation—including test paradigms that are up to the complex task of evaluating the technologies themselves. Cutting-edge wireless standards call for an evolution in test strategies that allow for higher frequency greater bandwidth and (de)modulation capabilities. They also require the expertise to streamline the path from design to production.

Teradyne solves those challenges. Here’s how:

Design. To start test engineers can use off-the shelf instruments to characterize new silicon. During this characterization phase Teradyne’s relationship with industry leaders like LitePoint can assist in the sourcing and supply of quality components to build the test equipment. These components can even be used for high-mix low-volume production runs using non-automated techniques based on single-site implementation. This doubles as a basis for later high-volume automation.

Production. Production planning of new silicon can usually occur alongside design. However instead of an inefficient multi-vendor approach it’s more sensible and cost-effective to identify and co-develop one proven platform with the versatility to test multiple devices. You can then focus on your core business while trusting the outsourcing of production to specialized experts in high-volume manufacturing. That in turn minimizes commercialization risks maximizes the utility of test instruments and keeps costs in check. And ultimately it drastically accelerates time to production.

With Teradyne the entire workflow—and the road to high-volume automation—begins with a single-site design. The proven method for finding defects and outliers lies in the functional test of these devices. That includes the following:

Transmitter quality: Power waveform (e.g. pulse) spur (i.e. spurious emissions) phase noise and modulation.

Receiver sensitivity: Dynamic range signal-to-noise ratio channel selectivity blocking and spur.

Performance tests: Susceptibility to multipath and Doppler shift sensitivity.

Other functionality: Throughput angle of arrival time of flight (ToF) and more.

Calibration and binning: Optimization for real-world application silicon sorting by build and performance.

While a well-developed single test site is invaluable it isn’t going to be affordable in production. Lower cost of test is best achieved not by cutting corners in testing but through larger scale. Current models suggest that ×4 to ×8 sites is the sweet spot as long as the process is accompanied by expertise in high-volume production. Regardless of the number of sites or the target wireless application no test solution is truly production-ready if it doesn’t address the trifecta of performance quality and cost.

Fig. 3: Tester fleet size for unit shipments of 100M/year (and test duration of 30 secs/DUT). Compared to x8 sites increasing sites to x16 has the net effect of reducing the number of testers from x18 to x9 which has a dramatic effect on OpEx.

Production-ready high volume manufacturing with Teradyne and UltraFLEX

Scaling up from single-site testing to high-volume manufacturing (HVM) comes with technical and economic considerations. Each is dependent on the other as the transition to multisite can generate impressive long-term economic advantages—provided of course that you have a trusted experienced HVM partner.

When HVM is done right new technologies can reach the market faster and with higher quality assurance allowing manufacturers to reinvest both profits and ROI back into their business. That’s as true for Wi-Fi 7 and UWB as it is for 5G and mmWave.

What sets Teradyne apart in this field is our ability to provide an HVM solution that’s fully production-ready. What exactly does this mean? Among other things:

Teradyne is an established and proven go-to partner in the semiconductor supplier chain.

We have experience with adoption among leading outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) services.

Our own success depends on mastering the next-generation wireless standards that will simplify semiconductor chip ramps for consumer devices.

We have the instruments to keep pace with the rapid advances in wireless applications to ensure performance quality and profitability.

Our UltraFLEX testers enjoy a large installed base and we’re developing new solutions to add Wi-Fi 7 and UWB capabilities to satisfy tomorrow’s connectivity demands.

In other words all the way from design to production we have all the pieces in place to ramp to HVM for the silicon that powers Wi-Fi 7 UWB and beyond. Our manufacturing automation technology spans the gamut from sockets load boards handlers and test instruments to our award-winning IG-XL software. Last but certainly not least we have a team of specialists who are available to co-develop future solutions and support commercial ramp with scalable test architectures.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A sleek 35000 square foot facility is expected to open in May 2023 acting as a sales service and delivery center.

When the facility opens up Tesla will have centers near three major cities in New Mexico — Albuquerque Rio Rancho and Santa Fe.

Tribal federal and state leaders met on Friday to announce the partnership between Tesla and Tamaya Ventures the business group for Santa Ana Pueblo.

“Like many of my fellow tribal leaders the Pueblo of Santa Ana has been working hard to grow our economy diversify our revenue sources and to create careers not just jobs” Santa Ana Pueblo Gov. Joey Sanchez said.

An initial group of tribal members will undergo a Tesla training program so they can be employed at the center. Jose Garcia is a manager for Tesla START an intensive company training program and said this electric vehicle technology is new to pretty much the entire automobile industry.

Charging an EV The new Tesla center will have a supercharging station for people to charge vehicles away from home. There are only 12 superchargers in New Mexico. For charging up at home New Mexico offers tax incentives for 75% of eligible costs to build a charging station. Varying incentives are available for charging stations at businesses and other places too.

“Our responsibility is going to be to properly train the other technicians to safely work on the vehicles and effectively repair them” Garcia said.

Tamaya Ventures Board Chairman Glenn Tenorio was a speaker at the event. He said this new facility will help diversify revenue for the Pueblo.

He brought up recent work in the Legislature that will help electric vehicle sales — a bill passed this year eliminated a double tax with state and tribal taxes that consumers would previously have to pay when purchasing cars on tribal land.

Tesla builds on tribal land to avoid N.M. law

Tesla started in 2003 and gained popularity over the years with billionaire owner Elon Musk. However the company couldn’t sell in New Mexico for a long time due to a law prohibiting direct car sales and repairs the only way Tesla actually sells and services automobiles.

Tesla bypassed that ban by opening a sales and service center in Nambé Pueblo in 2021 the first Tesla facility on Native American land. On Santa Ana Pueblo land another sovereign nation Tesla skips the state law by following what the tribal government offers in its bylaws direct automobile sales to customers.

Can tribal members afford Tesla? Prices for the Tesla cars are steep ranging from $40000 for older models to $130500 for the newer ones. The median household income for Santa Ana Pueblo is around $53000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau $18000 lower than the 2020 national median. Tenorio said he wants Tamaya Ventures to be able to work with Tesla to make more affordable models though it’s still ultimately up to Tesla.

The ban on direct car sales and repairs was originally put in place to prevent local dealerships from being put out of business by manufacturers and is in other states as well. Tesla has been fighting it for years and so have some lawmakers in New Mexico.

Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino (D-Albuquerque) sponsored a bill in 2019 that would lift the direct car sales ban. The legislation was created with Tesla in mind but died in the Legislature.

Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M) in attendance at the event said the law is antiquated and supports changing it. However he said he’s excited about these solutions that have been found to bring the electric vehicle company to the state.

“They really create opportunities in places like Santa Ana and Nambé that have allowed Tesla to work with communities that I think they didn’t necessarily have relationships with in the past” Heinrich said.

Tesla has been front and center for a number of controversies including fraud and false advertising recently with its autopilot technology. Heinrich said every car manufacturer he’s worked with has had its challenges but he’s had a very positive experience with Tesla and his own electric vehicles from the company. Heinrich said he drives a Tesla Model 3 a vehicle he’s owned for three years.

“I’ve worked with Tesla and other electric vehicle makers to really try to invest in this transition because it’s an enormous opportunity for us to really change our emissions profile” Heinrich said. “Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and there isn’t another manufacturer who’s done more to change that paradigm.”

Clean energy investments New Mexico Department of Transportation Secretary Ricky Serna attended the event and said over the next few years the state will invest more than $40 million toward electric vehicle charging infrastructure in New Mexico. The event brought people representing the Democratic congressional delegation from New Mexico that brought up clean energy investments passed by Congress including $5 billion for an electric vehicle charging network through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act.

Multiple speakers mentioned that the process to get the center going was challenging requiring long hours legal battles and sometimes frustration.

Tenorio said his Pueblo could model other tribal entities to take on similar ventures.

“Santa Ana (Pueblo) we want to continue to be a leader in taking the chance in bringing this type of business to the Pueblos” Tenorio said.

Heinrich said the electric vehicle market is growing fast and will dominate the entire car market in a decade. This partnership is making way for positive change he said.

“It’s at a moment in time in our history that we’re going to look back on in a few decades and realize that we were right at the fulcrum of incredible change with incredible leadership to make that change” Heinrich said.

Sanchez said collaboration was a key component in getting the center going and can be vital to creating other strategic partnerships in the future as well.

“I believe this is an opportunity for us to come together to begin to imagine and build the next generation’s economy” the Pueblo’s governor said. “We can obviously make this bigger for all of us. We can make this the future for us put New Mexico on the map. Pueblos tribes of New Mexico — put us on the map.”

Despite being a small tribe Sanchez said they’re doing big things.

“We are no longer waiting for the world to come to Santa Ana Tamaya” Sanchez said. “We are now taking Tamaya to the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvaG5rb2V0c2llci8yMDIyLzEwLzExL3N1cnZleS00MC01MC1vZi11cy10cnVzdC1vdXItc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLXZlaGljbGVzLWZyb20tdGVzbGEtYW5kLWNhZGlsbGFjLWZhci10b28tbXVjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Survey: 40-50% Of Us Trust Our 'Self-Driving' Vehicles From Tesla And Cadillac Far Too Much,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/10/11/survey-40-50-of-us-trust-our-self-driving-vehicles-from-tesla-and-cadillac-far-too-much/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvaG5rb2V0c2llci8yMDIyLzEwLzExL3N1cnZleS00MC01MC1vZi11cy10cnVzdC1vdXItc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLXZlaGljbGVzLWZyb20tdGVzbGEtYW5kLWNhZGlsbGFjLWZhci10b28tbXVjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbWlzc291bGFjdXJyZW50LmNvbS90cmliZS1uZXctbWV4aWNvLXRlc2xhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Second tribe in New Mexico set to open Tesla dealership in 2023,"Megan Gleason

Here is why you should care,"Image: Tesla

Tesla announced this week that it plans to remove all ultrasonic sensors (USS) from new cars and lean into ""Tesla Vision"" instead. This departure from sensors and a reliance on camera-only driver assistance deviates from what is typically used in the automotive industry – a combination of cameras and sensors.

However as the past has shown going against the industry's grain is basically part of Tesla's DNA.

""Tesla continues to buck the trend of the industry of adding more sensors to the overall sensor suite of Camera/Ultrasonic/Radar/Lidar"" Mark Fitzgerald researcher at Strategy Analytics said to ZDNET distinguishing Tesla ""from pretty much everyone else in the industry.""

Ultrasonic sensors are typically used by vehicles to support anti-collision safety systems helping to detect objects in near proximity and to assist with parking. Tesla assures consumers that the removal of the sensors will not affect consumer safety.

""Compared to radar-equipped vehicles Model 3 and Model Y with Tesla Vision have either maintained or improved their active safety ratings in the US and Europe and perform better in pedestrian automatic emergency braking (AEB) intervention"" Tesla said Tuesday.

All Model 3 and Model Y cars built for North America Europe the Middle East and Taiwan starting early October will no longer be built with ultrasonic sensors and will solely rely on Tesla Vision.

Also: Tesla Model Y receives highest overall safety score in new European assessment

In 2023 the Model S and Model X will undergo a similar rollout without the USS sensors as well. If you already have one of these vehicles with the USS sensors no worries – the tech will remain intact on those cars.

So what is Tesla Vision? The term refers to Tesla's attempt to move away from traditional radars and sensors and depend solely on the suite of cameras on the vehicles to make driving decisions. The transition began in 2021 when Tesla removed radar from Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in North America.

Tesla's move towards Tesla Vision is motivated by the intention to make the car's decision-making processes operate the same way a human would with a vision-based system. ""The automaker believes it best to try to replicate that purely with cameras and artificial neural nets and not let the radar data pollute the system"" as Electrek noted.

Tesla Vision will still be able to provide the technology necessary for Autopilot Enhanced Autopilot FSD capability and active safety features according to Tesla. However there are certain limitations to using Tesla Vision that Tesla has even acknowledged itself.

During the period of time that the company makes the transition from USS to Tesla Vision cars that are not equipped with USS will be delivered with some features temporarily limited or inactive.

Source: Tesla

These limitations will be an inconvenience for customers especially those who were drawn to Tesla because of its software.

""Owners are used to receiving new features and updates delivered over-the-air (OTA)"" Chris Jones chief analyst at research firm Canalys said to ZDNET. ""It will be an inconvenience for new owners not to have the features for a period during the transition. Tesla must communicate effectively with those drivers impacted.""

In addition to potentially disappointing and losing customers during the transition period there is also added pressure to make sure that Tesla Vision is truly capable of doing what it says it can – if it can't there won't be a backup system to rely on.

""The main risk in Tesla's strategy is losing redundancy – USS as back-up if there is a Tesla Vision error or malfunction"" said Jones. ""Reliability and safety will ultimately be the test of whether the strategy was the right one to follow.""

Musk has been very vocal about his intention to get a fully self-driving car out on the market for years first bringing up the idea in 2016. At an energy conference in Norway in August of this year Musk reportedly announced his plans to get Tesla's self-driving technology ready for release by year-end.

Also: Elon Musk says Tesla Cybertruck is waterproof enough to cross rivers and lakes – and even seas

However competitors in the market have always depended on the use of sensors to develop self-driving technology. The removal of USS from cars could possibly impact that vision Musk has of getting FSD out as soon as possible.

""Most other autonomous or semi-autonomous systems are adding sensor functionality including imaging radar and lidar to their higher-performing L2+ and L3/L4 systems mostly for redundancy and all-weather performance"" Fitzgerald said. ""It has not been proven that Tesla Vision can perform in all of these conditions.""

Since USS is mostly used for objects in near proximity and parking it may not have any direct impacts on FSD according to Jones.

Even if the technology does hold up and is successfully proven to be able to support a FSD vehicle people may still be hesitant to purchase the FSD upgrade due to the novelty of Tesla Vision.

""Tesla risks attracting a lower customer uptake (attach rate) of the now more expensive FSD option if customers feel any doubt about its future capabilities"" said Fitzgerald.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8xMC8xMS90ZXNsYS1zbGlwcy1vd25zLXR3by10aGlyZHMtdXMtZXYtbWFya2V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla slips but still owns two-thirds of the US EV market,"Tesla’s market shares slip in the US but the automaker still owns two-thirds of the rapidly growing market.

For years now Tesla has dominated the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market but for now the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla’s production and deliveries.

For the entire year of 2020 Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States. In 2021 that number went down to 69.95% but that’s still impressive with EV delivery volumes significantly increasing throughout the year along with Tesla’s prices.

Now we have been tracking Tesla’s market share erosion in 2022. New market entrants are having an impact there’s no doubt but Tesla is still responsible for most EV sales in the US.

According to new registration data from Experian Tesla now has about two-thirds of the EV market in 2022 as of August.

Ford and Hyundai are making strides with second and third place but there are still extremely far behind Tesla which still has four of the top five best-selling electric vehicles in the country:

Tesla Model Y: 134978 units Tesla Model 3: 123634 units Ford Mustang Mach-E: 25596 units Tesla Model S: 20032 units Tesla Model X: 19739 units Hyundai Ioniq 5: 16929 units Kia EV6: 15612 units Chevy Bolt EUV: 11788 units VW ID.4: 9127 units Nissan Leaf: 8740 units

Tesla’s supremacy is not expected to be challenged much in the short term due to the massive lead but several electric vehicles are expected to see significant ramp-ups in the short term.

GM recently announced a boost in Bolt EV deliveries in Q4 and Ford’s F-150 Lightning production is still slowly ramping up.

Electrek’s Take

It’s really interesting how different those volumes are at this point. Tesla is the only automaker with models in the six figures and by a wide margin.

And there’s no demand problem in sight.

I am convinced that GM could sell Chevy Bolt EV and EUV in the six figures if it could produce them. It should get closer to it next year with a production of 77000 units next year.

The Ioniq 5 and EV6 could also likely be six figure-vehicles if the capacity was available.

As I have been saying for years the winners of the rEVolution are the automakers who were early to invest in production capacity and Tesla is still clearly the one reaping the rewards in the US."
TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzExLzMtdGhpbmdzLWFib3V0LXRzbWMtdGhhdC1zbWFydC1pbnZlc3RvcnMta25vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Things About TSMC That Smart Investors Know,"Let's dig deeper into Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing the world's largest contract chipmaker.

Most tech investors likely know that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 4.41%) also known as TSMC is the world's first largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. They also probably know that it manufactures chips for top fabless chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices Qualcomm and Apple which makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor industry.

Those strengths have enabled TSMC to generate big gains for patient investors. Over the past 10 years TSMC's stock has rallied more than 350% as the Nasdaq Composite advanced 250%. Despite that decade of consistently strong growth TSMC is still a solid long-term play on the semiconductor sector.

That's a lot to know about this semiconductor giant. But here are three lesser-known facts about this chipmaker that many investors may have overlooked. Knowing these could make you smarter than the average buyer.

1. TSMC's founder once worked at Texas Instruments

TSMC was founded by Morris Chang in 1987. But prior to his return to Taiwan Chang worked for three decades in America. He spent 25 of those years at Texas Instruments where he eventually became the chipmaker's global VP of semiconductors. But instead of being promoted to the C suite Chang was abruptly transferred to lead TI's struggling consumer division before being ""put out to pasture"" (in his own words) at a staff job.

Chang who was 52 years old when he left TI subsequently became the president and chief operating officer of General Instrument for a year. He then returned to Taiwan to lead the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) a non-profit open lab and incubator that eventually fostered the creation of TSMC and its largest domestic competitor United Microelectronics.

So if TI had promoted Chang back in the 1980s there's a strong chance that TSMC wouldn't even exist today. TI might have also evolved into a more technologically advanced integrated device manufacturer (IDM) like Intel under Chang's leadership as opposed to its current reputation as a producer of simpler analog and embedded chips.

2. Its technological lead depends on a single company

TSMC's two closest competitors in the chip foundry market are Intel and Samsung. But over the past decade TSMC pulled ahead of both tech giants in the ""process race"" to create smaller and denser chips. By establishing that lead TSMC became the only contract chipmaker that could produce top-tier chips for companies like Apple and AMD.

TSMC's success can be entirely attributed to its early adoption of ASML's (ASML 1.80%) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. ASML is the only manufacturer of EUV systems which are used to etch circuit patterns on silicon wafers for the smallest and densest chips in the world. ASML doesn't face any competition in the EUV market for two reasons: It took decades to perfect its technology and a single EUV system costs about $200 million to manufacture and requires multiple planes to ship.

TSMC Intel and Samsung were all initially skeptical of the new technology. But Apple stepped in told TSMC it needed EUV systems to produce its next-gen chips and even offered to finance its initial purchases. That partnership which started in 2014 after Apple shifted its chip orders from Samsung to TSMC enabled TSMC to install EUV systems before its rivals.

Intel and Samsung are now finally trying to buy more EUV systems to catch up to TSMC but it will likely take tens of billions of dollars and several years -- along with big government subsidies -- to narrow that gap.

3. It actually manufactures some chips in China

One of the most frequently cited risks regarding TSMC is its geographic location. Its most advanced fabrication plants are all located in Taiwan which leaves it exposed to a potential military conflict with mainland China. That's why TSMC with the support of U.S. subsidies has been building a plant for manufacturing its top-tier 5nm chips in Arizona.

But TSMC also operates two plants in China. These two plants which are located in Nanjing and Shanghai don't produce any chips that are smaller than the 28nm node because TSMC doesn't want its more advanced designs to be leaked to rival Chinese chipmakers like SMIC. However 28nm chips are still used in plenty of lower-end devices across the consumer electronics automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. In the second quarter of 2022 TSMC still generated 10% of its revenue from 28nm chips while another 25% came from its even larger nodes.

Therefore TSMC and China have a more symbiotic relationship instead of an adversarial one. TSMC needs to keep operating its plants in China to maintain a stable supply of lower-end chips (especially for the automotive and IoT markets) while Chinese tech companies still need a steady supply of higher-end chips from TSMC's Taiwanese foundries.

It's still one of the best semiconductor stocks

These facts might not tip the scales in favor of the bulls or the bears but they offer valuable insights into a company that has become the bellwether of the global semiconductor market. TSMC's stock might remain volatile in the near term amid the recent macro headwinds but I believe it still has plenty of room to grow over the long term as chips become faster more advanced and more essential to a wide range of industries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlam91cm5hbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jYW4tYW55LWVtZXJnaW5nLW1lbW9yeS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvcHBsZS1kcmFtLWFuZC1uYW5kLWZsYXNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Any Emerging Memory Technology Topple DRAM and NAND Flash?,"by Steven Leibson

During its recent quarterly financial update on July 28 Intel announced that it was winding down its Optane Persistent Memory business using what amounts to a footnote in its earnings report. (See “Optane We Hardly Knew Yeh.”) The writing had been on the wall. There was one fab making production Optane chips based in Lehi Utah owned by Micron and Micron sold the fab to Texas Instruments earlier in the year. You can bet that Texas Instruments wasn’t interested in making Optane memory for Intel in Utah. The end of Optane can’t be much of a surprise to anyone.

According to Tom Coughlin and Jim Handy two of the world’s foremost analysts following the ebb and flow of the semiconductor memory business Intel has steadily lost money on Optane parts for years – as in many hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter on average since 2016. In Pat Gelsinger’s new world for Intel a product that consistently loses money for years is a product he doesn’t want in his company’s product portfolio.

So Optane ends up on the growing pile of abandoned memory technologies that would challenge DRAM and NAND Flash memory for world domination. Numerous companies have tried to develop many alternative semiconductor memory technologies and they have all failed to gain significant market share against DRAMs and NAND Flash memory. However that doesn’t mean that companies won’t continue to try because the rewards are immense.

Recently my friend Robert Bielby at Micron told me something that I already knew sort of but his framing stopped me short. Of the top four semiconductor companies three are the leaders in the semiconductor memory business (Samsung Micron and SK hynix which have about 94% of the DRAM market). The fourth company Intel invented the semiconductor memory business but then exited re-entered to make Flash memory and recently exited again. Wash rinse repeat. So if a company wants to climb to the top of the semiconductor heap then memory is probably the game to play.

There are several games being played in this market already and most of these memory technologies involve some sort of non-volatile memory that improves on NAND Flash memory in one or more critical ways. I’ve always been fascinated by the various physical phenomena that semiconductor makers have used to create new “emerging” types of memory and there have been more than a few. Coughlin and Handy have summarized these several new and different memory technologies in a new report titled “Emerging Memories Enter Next Phase” and they have been working on an updated version to cover Intel’s exit from the Optane business. That new version should be available by the time this article appears so you should check it out.

Many of these new memory technologies may first be used as embedded memory placed on chip with CMOS logic but the Holy Grail for all these memory efforts because of the unit volumes involved is the development of “storage-class memory” which needs to be nonvolatile like NAND Flash memory but as fast as or preferably faster than DRAM so that both existing memory types can be replaced by one new type. That’s a tall order and something to be desired but not yet attained. Meanwhile here’s a stroll down the lane of three emerging memory technologies paired with some of my experiences with them.

Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM FRAM)

FRAM is the first new memory technology I encountered when I first started to write for electronics publications in the 1980s. According to Coughlin’s and Handy’s report ferroelectric memory was invented in 1952 the year before I was born. Bell Labs built an integrated 256-bit FRAM array as a monolithic device with no active semiconductor elements in 1955 three years before Jack Kilby cobbled together and invented the first integrated circuit at Texas Instruments. I first encountered FRAM in the late 1980s at a company named Ramtron located in Colorado Springs. According to Coughlin and Handy Ramtron did the early commercialization work on FRAM. They write:

“FRAM appears to have sold more unit volume than all other emerging memory types combined. Fujitsu uses FRAM in its RFID chips for subway fare cards and has sold over 4 billion of these chips to date.”

FRAMs exploit a unique physical characteristic of certain crystal lattices. In these ferroelectric materials an atom can occupy one of two stable places within the crystal lattice. An electric field shifts the mobile atom within the crystal lattice to either one of the two stable positions depending on the field’s polarity and some physical property – perhaps capacitance or resistance – changes depending on the position of that trapped atom.

Four billion chips of any type is a lot of chips even if it’s used as a subway fare token so why is FRAM still unknown after all this time and after shipping all those billions of chips? Semiconductor fab managers don’t like ferroelectric materials very much because they incorporate periodic table elements such as lead or bismuth that can easily contaminate the fab. So FRAM has seen limited use as a non-volatile embedded on-chip memory. Coughlin’s and Handy’s report mentions that hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide can also be formulated to exhibit ferroelectric properties and these materials are already used in fabs for other reasons so FRAM’s future story is likely to continue.

Resistive RAM (RRAM ReRAM Memristors)

In 1971 Leon Chua at the University of California Berkeley wrote a theoretical paper titled “Memristor–The Missing Circuit Element.” The paper describes a fourth basic passive electronic device the memristor which regulates the flow of electrical current through itself based on the amount of charge that has previously flowed through the device. Chua didn’t build such a device. Back in 1971 the memristor was simply theoretical. It was a hypothetical device that satisfied the apparent need for symmetry in the equations used to describe the behavior of the other three basic passive electronic components: resistors capacitors and inductors. Memristors existed in theory but not in practice.

That all changed nearly four decades later in 2008 when HP Labs announced that it had managed to build a memristor out of titanium dioxide and that memristors were non-binary devices that could be used to store analog or digital data. It was an electrifying announcement and people were soon predicting the imminent demise of DRAM to be supplanted by memristors in the form of resistive memory or RRAM. Further said HP it would be using RRAM in its forthcoming moon-shot computer dubbed “The Machine.”

By 2015 HP had backed off and said it would use DRAM in The Machine instead of memristors. Fifteen years after HP’s memristor announcement the RRAM revolution has yet to occur and it doesn’t appear that it will happen any time soon. Coughlin’s and Handy’s report details several RRAM/ReRAM efforts and RRAM’s time may yet arrive – real soon now no doubt.

Phase-Change Memory (PCM)

Phase-change memory or PCM uses some major physical transformation of a material – like the transition between a crystalline state and an amorphous state – and the associated changes in electrical characteristics – to store data. Based on its history Optane memory is likely a type of PCM. Optane’s roots go back to a prolific inventor named Stanford Ovshinsky who spent decades studying the characteristics and uses for amorphous semiconductors. I remember discussing Ovshinsky’s work with my friend and college classmate Jim Blike back in the early 1970s. He was very excited by Ovshinsky’s pioneering work.

Ovshinsky founded Energy Conversion Laboratories in 1960 to study amorphous materials and their phase-change properties. That lab became Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) in 1964 and one of Ovshinsky’s many innovations was Ovonics Phase-Change Memory named for himself. Intel and Micron eventually became involved with Ovshinsky and ECD licensed the Ovonics Phase-Change Memory intellectual property and announced 3D XPoint PCM in 2015 to much fanfare.

Micron and Intel expended a lot of effort on and generated excitement about 3D XPoint PCM but I seem to remember that one of the early problems reported with the technology was that moderate heat could anneal the bits right out of a PCM memory cell and there’s plenty of heat available inside of a data center server. This heat problem meant that PCM might need to be refreshed like DRAM. Depending on how hot the ambient temperature was the refresh cycles might need to be fairly frequent on the order of a few seconds. However I haven’t heard much about this problem lately so perhaps it’s been solved.

The problem that has not been overcome is the relative cost per bit. Intel’s losses on Optane memory devices and Micron’s prior exit from the 3D XPoint venture stand as proof that even major semiconductor makers like Intel and Micron have great difficulty making PCMs price competitive even with a decade of R&D behind the effort.

Magnetic RAM (MRAM)

I must confess I have a special affinity for magnetic memory. The first computer to use magnetic memory was the MIT Whirlwind computer project which got the world’s first magnetic core memory on August 8 1953 just a month before I was born. Magnetic core memory completely dominated the computer memory space for the next two decades. However Intel’s introduction of the first commercially viable semiconductor DRAM the 1103 in late 1970 sounded the death knell for magnetic core memory.

Core memory had remained a hand-woven and therefore expensive product. It resisted every effort to automate its manufacture although companies did try. They simply failed. Meanwhile semiconductor DRAM leveraged the mass-production manufacturing technologies that made integrated circuits the driving force in the electronics industry starting with lithography. Magnetic core memory vanished seemingly overnight. By 1975 DRAM clearly ruled the memory roost.

Magnetic memory has continued to fascinate technologists over the years. Intel Western Electric Texas Instruments Rockwell National Semiconductor Hitachi Westinghouse Motorola Fujitsu and Sharp all made failed attempts to commercialize magnetic bubble memory starting in the late 1970s. IBM developed Racetrack memory an updated 1-dimensional version of bubble memory starting in the early 2000s. Still not there yet. Even if one of these magnetic memory technologies succeeds they’re serial memories and therefore relatively slow and good only for disk replacement or these days for replacing SSDs based on NAND Flash memory.

Magnetic RAM MRAM attempts to meld the mass-manufacturing techniques of lithography-based semiconductor production with magnetic bit storage. Nonvolatile MRAMs are now available as commercial products from Everspin Technologies. I have been writing about that company for at least ten years. Everspin says it has sold many millions of its MRAM chips. That’s nowhere close to DRAM and NAND Flash unit volumes but it’s not nothing either.

However MRAMs have two significant competitive problems compared to DRAM and NAND Flash chips: bit density per chip and cost. MRAM vendors are trying all sorts of ways to overcome these competitive challenges. The latest hope is called STT (Spin Torque Transfer) MRAM. Coughlin’s and Handy’s report provides vast amounts of technical detail for nine different types of MRAM including STT MRAM.

Perhaps one of the four types of emerging memory – FRAM RRAM PCM or MRAM – will be the Holy Grail for Storage Class Memory. Perhaps it will be some other memory technology. Maybe something like Star Trek’s isolinear chips whatever they are.

This Dallas girl was born on May 30 1928 at Baylor Hospital and went home with her parents Thomas Kilpatrick and Evelyn Smith Johnston to a big sister Muriel and two brothers Arnold (Buddy) and David.

Sheila was admitted to the Cradle Roll of First Presbyterian Church of Dallas and confirmed there as a child. In 1976 she reaffirmed her saving faith in Jesus Christ when she was baptized at Reinhardt Bible Church.

Her parents came to Dallas from Dundee Scotland–first her father in 1913 then after serving as a US soldier in WWI he returned to Dundee married Evelyn and brought her to the US on a troop ship in 1919. The Johnston family’s Scottish heritage family and friends would define much of Sheila’s life with high teas every Sunday afternoon at the family’s home on Lakewood Boulevard pilgrimages back to Dundee and an appreciation for tartan shortbread and bagpipes. In addition Sheila held sweet memories of a carefree childhood – bicycle trips for picnics at White Rock Lake sodas at Harrell’s drugstore a band of neighborhood friends and summers working at Dallas Medical and Surgical Clinic on Live Oak Street.

Her education began with Kindergarten at James W. Fannin Elementary School on Ross Avenue then William Lipscomb Elementary School J. L. Long Middle School and Woodrow Wilson High School–graduating in 1946. In 1950 she received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Southern Methodist University which she utilized working for Texas Instruments and American Airlines. She met fellow employee J Fred Bauer in the ticketing office at Love Field and they married in 1952.

Two daughters were born to them in Dallas and a son and daughter after they moved to Houston. During those years she was a stay-at-home mom–baking cookies for brownie troops carpooling keeping house and a household budget hosting bridge luncheons and dinner parties and reaching out to neighbors and friends.

The family moved back to Dallas in 1967 and built a home in East Dallas. After the couple divorced in 1973 Sheila returned to business administration work–first at Merchants Greeters Service; then with various garment manufacturers: Creative Image Herman Marcus Inc. Donovan-Galvani of Dallas and Southwestern Apparel Inc.; and finally for the publisher of Park Cities People.

In 1981 she and her daughter Mary Vera purchased The Karat Top at the Olla Podrida and she immersed herself in buying and selling antique and vintage jewelry through the summer of 2022.

As a single mother she made her children her priority and taught them to follow Jesus and to treat everyone with kindness and respect. Intelligent proper courageous and stalwart describe her well. She was never vain but she was a striking woman at almost six feet tall.

She is survived by her children Sheila Lynne Brandon Mary Alice Vera John Fredrick Bauer and wife Lisa and Evelyn Frances Bauer Wolff and husband Win; 11 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

Her life was celebrated at a private family graveside service at Sparkman/Hillcrest Memorial Park where her family members are all interred at the Mausoleum.

Global 300mm Semiconductor Fab Capacity Projected to Reach New High in 2025

Oct. 11 2022 - Semiconductor manufacturers worldwide are forecast to expand 300mm fab capacity at a nearly 10% compound average growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2025 reaching an all-time high of 9.2 million wafers per month (wpm) SEMI announced today in its 300mm Fab Outlook to 2025 report. Strong demand for automotive semiconductors and new government funding and incentive programs in multiple regions are driving much of the growth.



New fabs announced by companies including GlobalFoundries Intel Micron Samsung SkyWater Technology TSMC and Texas Instruments are ramping in 2024 or 2025 to help meet the growth in demand.



“While shortages of some chips have eased and supply of others has remained tight the semiconductor industry is laying the groundwork to meet longer-term demand for a broad range of emerging applications as it expands 300mm fab capacity” said Ajit Manocha SEMI president and CEO. “SEMI is currently tracking 67 new 300mm fabs or major additions of new lines expected to start construction from 2022 to 2025.”







Regional outlooks

China is projected to increase its global share of 300mm front-end fab capacity from 19% in 2021 to 23% in 2025 reaching 2.3 million wpm a rise driven by factors including growing government investments in the domestic chip industry. With the growth China is nearing global leader Korea in 300mm fab capacity and expected to overtake Taiwan now in second place next year.



Taiwan’s worldwide capacity share is expected to slip 1% to 21% from 2021 to 2025 while Korea’s share is also projected to edge lower 1% to 24% during the same period. Japan’s share of worldwide 300mm fab capacity is on a path to fall from 15% in 2021 to 12% in 2025 as competition with other regions increases.



The Americas’ global share of 300mm fab capacity is forecast to rise from 8% in 2021 to 9% in 2025 driven partly by U.S. CHIPS Act funding and incentives. Europe/Mideast is projected to increase its capacity share from 6% to 7% during the same period on the strength of European CHIPS Act investments and incentives. Southeast Asia is expected to maintain its 5% share of 300mm front-end fab capacity during the forecast period.



Projected capacity growth rates by product type

From 2021 to 2025 the 300mm Fab Outlook to 2025 shows Power-related capacity with the strongest growth at a 39% CAGR followed by Analog at 37% Foundry at 14% Opto at 7% and Memory at 5%. The latest update of the SEMI 300mm Fab Outlook to 2025 report tracks 356 current and future fabs.

The company is displaying the aquatically inclined Ripsaw M3 ground robot technology demonstrator at its booth during the show which runs Oct. 10-12. Textron will demonstrate the robot’s flexibility to accommodate a variety of payloads by swapping them in and out each day of the show according to David Phillips the company’s senior vice president of land and sea systems.

Textron debuted its Ripsaw M5 at AUSA in 2019 and the Army selected the system for the Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium prototyping evaluation program shortly thereafter. The company has built for the Army five prototypes including an all-electric version released in 2020.

The service has put these vehicles into soldiers’ hands over the last several years for operational experiments most recently a five-week event at Fort Hood Texas.

At 8 tons including payloads the M3 robot is smaller than the M5 version Phillips told Defense News but is still a bit larger than what the Army has evaluated in an Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light category. The size of the robot is meant to show how Textron can scale the system Phillips said. The Army has not settled on the exact size required for any of its ground robots but Textron’s system can fit in a CH-47 cargo helicopter Phillips said.

The M3 “incorporates a lot of maturity and a lot of the learnings from the M5 product and the several thousand hours of operational experience that we have garnered through it” Phillips said. “We’re not trying to necessarily presuppose what the Army is going to come up with. We’ve put this technology demonstrator together to position ourselves to de-risk eventually delivering these bid samples that they’re eventually going to want for an RCV-Light.”

Textron is displaying the aquatically inclined Ripsaw M3 ground robot technology demonstrator at its booth during AUSA. (Textron Systems)

Most noticeable on the new ground robot is its visible water jets which allow it to swim Phillips said. The technology is derived from the Cottonmouth Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle Textron is delivering to the Marine Corps Phillips added.

While the Army doesn’t have a swimming requirement “we just wanted to get out ahead of that” given the service navigates wet gap crossings he said. The effort is more challenging because the robot is tracked rather than wheeled Phillips noted so it’s important to demonstrate the capability and learn from it.

At AUSA M3 is expected to first feature Electro Optics Systems’ R400S remote weapon station with a 30mm armament on the front as well as CACI International’s expeditionary mobile air defense integrated system which is a kinetic counter-drone weapon and a non-kinetic electronic attack module at the rear.

On the second day the company plans to swap in Kongsberg’s Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station with Javelin missiles or CROWS-J on the front; the back is expected to feature Anduril’s Area-I Altius air-launched effects system.

The third day is expected to feature a Kongsberg CROWS in the front with an Arnold Defense modular lightweight Hydra system — a high-capacity 2.75-inch multiple rocket launcher — on the back.

The M3 is designed with enhanced mobility in mind Phillips said with a 14-inch ground clearance. “It needs to keep up with the manned systems it needs to stay ahead of the manned systems” Phillips said.

Textron also ramped up the robot’s ruggedness after learning from M5 evaluations.

Network issues cropped up during RCV experimentation with the Army so Textron is working to ensure manned and unmanned vehicles have dependable connectivity and can maneuver well together Phillips said.

The company will continue to demonstrate capabilities using the M3 over several years. The effort will guide what it submits to the Army’s RCV-Light competition and any other subsequent RCV competitions.

Meanwhile the Army plans to launch a competition to select and build initial prototypes for an RCV-L in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 based on revised requirements generated from rigorous experimentation over the last several years with RCV-Light -Medium and -Heavy.

“We’re going to require it to be architected in such a way that we can add capability to it over time whether that’s by adding sensors but mostly by adding software” Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean program executive officer for the Army’s ground combat systems told Defense News in a recent interview.

The Army wants to field RCV-Light to a first unit around 2028 he added “but I think there’s potential for us to be able to pull that to the left.”

Part of the ongoing evaluations include experimenting with a range of combinations of different-sized RCVs which are “informing future senior leader decisions about whether we want to proceed with a medium program or whether perhaps there are other alternatives” Brig. Gen. Geoffrey Norman the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team lead said in the same interview with Dean.

“Maybe we’re able to get capabilities that soldiers and leaders need with a single platform” Norman added “and we’re continuing to experiment in important ways on that to make sure that we’re making operationally informed decisions.”

Textron Systems is already fielding Shadow Block III unmanned aircraft to combat aviation brigades and special forces units the company recently told Breaking Defense. The company said it is upgrading the performance and reliability of the aircraft as it prepares for the UAS to be used by Army units through at least 2036 “and likely beyond that” according to Wayne Prender senior vice president for air systems at Textron.

“The scenarios and the places that Shadow will be operated in the next 15 years they’re going to be more contested as compared to the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters” Prender said ahead of the Association of the United States Army annual conference. “So we’re actively working with the Army to ensure that our system is more survivable in those contested environments.”

FULL COVERAGE: AUSA 2022

Since the Army selected Textron’s Shadow program in 1999 the drone has flown 1.3 million flight hours. On the battlefield soldiers used the Shadow for reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition and the platform also serves as an aerial communications relay to connect ground networks.

But over the last several years the Army has been working to replace its infantry brigades’ runway-dependent Shadows with the Future Tactical Unmanned Aerial System an as-yet undecided new platform capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). Textron has put forward another smaller drone the Aerosonde for that competition.



For the Shadow Textron still has customers elsewhere in the service. So far the company said it has fielded about 100 of the new the Shadow Block IIIs and plans to get the bird in the hands of all 11 of the Army’s combat aviation brigades.

On Block III Prender said Textron increased engine power by 24 percent allowing the engine to aircraft’s gross take-off weight to 537 pounds and 95 pounds of payload. Because of that the new block is also 60 percent quieter.

The company also has more on-board power and includes a computer which Prender said would allow Textron to make future upgrades to Shadows down the line. In addition the aircraft carries higher-fidelity higher-definition electro-optical/infrared cameras which can increase the stand-off range.

Prender said the Block III Shadow will also be able to carry more special mission payloads including electronic warfare and intelligence systems and provide increased communications relay ability to connect or extend the range of ground networks. To enhance Shadow’s survivability the Block III aircraft can operate in up to two inches of rain Prender said.

To upgrade the drones the company sends units new vehicles that fit into existing equipment and the company sends the old drones back to the factory for “reset and refurbishment” where they come out as Block III air vehicles. The company is currently 40 percent through “new equipment training” courses that last about five weeks which includes two weeks of ground familiarization and three weeks of flight training he said.

The Future (Tactical Unmanned Aerial System) Is Vertical

Under the Future Tactical Unmanned Aerial System program the Army is looking for a vertical take off and landing (VTOL) drone to reduce dependency on runaways as well as a platform that can operate in weather.

Prender said that the company’s small UAS offering Aerosonde is designed to do that and can also be equipped with over 40 different variations of electronic warfare signals intelligence and other special payloads — payloads that Prender said could also be configured for the Shadow in the future.

The Aerosonde platform will take part in Project Convergence 22 where it will demonstrate different capabilities including EW. As it competes for the FTUAS program of record Textron leaders believe that the company’s decades of experience in provided unmanned systems to Army including the Shadow will be a major benefit.

“We understand what those soldiers go through. It needs to be simple it needs to be intuitive. It needs to work every time. It needs to be ready when they are for the missions at hand” Prender said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZXBoYXJkbWVkaWEuY29tL25ld3MvZGVmZW5jZS1ub3Rlcy90ZXh0cm9uLXN5c3RlbXMtYmVuZWZpdHMtb2YtbW9zYS1hY3Jvc3MtbWlzc2lvbi1zZXRzLXNwb25zb3JlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Textron Systems: Benefits of MOSA Across Mission Sets (Sponsored) | Shephard,"This article is brought to you by Textron Systems.

As a leader in the development design and manufacture of defense systems including armored vehicles unmanned aircraft specialty marine craft and electronic systems Textron Systems knows the importance of reliable systems integration with a modular systems approach (MOSA) and architecture.

Developing systems that fail to consider long-term design flexibility is bad for both the customer and the manufacturer. When original equipment manufacturers lock in a customer to using only their products it adds unnecessary constraints and expense to a project.

Eurosatory 2022: Textron M5 now available on the international market

By implementing a deliberate comprehensive design approach integrators provide the capability to avoid vendor lock inject new technology from diverse suppliers and rapidly leverage a broad base of investment. This is why Textron Systems embraces MOSA across its multi-domain portfolio. It keeps a system more affordable adaptable and sustainable throughout the entire lifecycle.

The benefits from MOSA are both programmatic and economic. As a systems integrator Textron Systems understands the responsibility of looking at a system holistically and from a user experience perspective. If customers want to make their money go farther then MOSA is the solution.

Whether it is customer – or Textron Systems – provided technology MOSA enables rapid technology integration and testing as well as qualification while retaining the resilience of the overall solution – while not compromising growth capacity. MOSA has been fundamental to Textron Systems’ roadmap and a key enabler to move emerging technologies into the field to address a wide range of mission sets.

For example the RIPSAW® M5 Robotic Vehicle – Medium (RV-M) now available in the international market has a flat-deck design which has been manufactured with the highest reliability and capability standards. Developed by Textron Systems and its subsidiary Howe & Howe the vehicle’s core platform delivers extreme off-road mobility and incorporates MOSA “all the way to the tracks” making the system simple to equip for unique mission requirements to support military civil and commercial applications.

“The M5 RV-M is ready to accept a wide variety of payloads. With its open architecture we have demonstrated rapid integration of customer provided payloads and operating systems to execute a variety of mission capabilities. Textron Systems has expertise in providing customers with the support necessary to turn their operational needs into a reality” said David Phillips Senior Vice President for Land and Sea Systems Textron Systems.

For the U.S. Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) competition Textron Systems is a member of Team Lynx on the Lynx OMFV which is also designed to accept a multitude of different payloads. The vehicle will be able to integrate a variety of payloads including loitering munitions counter unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) technology among others.

Both of these vehicles represent true next-generation vehicles designed to the highest standards. However when it comes to all-domain capabilities the perfect example is Textron Systems’ U.S. Marine Corps’ Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) prototype. Textron Systems’ offering the Cottonmouth™ ARV integrates sensors and capabilities across the land air sea electromagnetic and cyber domains.

Textron Systems has expertise in providing customers with the support necessary to turn their operational needs into a reality. — David Phillips Senior Vice President for Land and Sea Systems Textron Systems

The vehicle synergizes capabilities into one battle/marine station that delivers unprecedented multi-domain awareness and enables transformative joint warfare concepts. Key to this approach was implementing a digital design environment and model-based systems engineering to provide the Marine Corps with the means to easily and quickly integrate future capabilities using modular interfaces eventually achieving its goal to realize a family of systems.

Textron Systems also is capable of organically developing air land sea and electronic cross-domain capabilities. At Cyber Quest 2022 this past March the company’s unmanned air and ground systems highlighted Textron Systems’ ability to develop awareness and converge effects across a multi-domain battlespace.

During the event Textron Systems’ Aerosonde® UAS displayed its ability to employ multi-intelligence payload packages to detect identify locate and report electronic threats and seamlessly pass cues to the Howe & Howe RS2-H1 robotic land vehicle without reliance on GPS. By leveraging the Aerosonde® UAS open payload interface and modular mission computer architecture Textron Systems demonstrated an unprecedented speed of integration to employ two new advanced Electronic Warfare payloads as part of the event.

Another example Textron Systems’ Shadow® RQ-7B V2 Blk III – a tactical UAS – provides advanced capabilities in a battlespace that is continuously evolving. The Shadow has easily configurable payloads including high-definition electro-optical/infrared systems communications relay and laser designation.

The Shadow system is backed by Textron Systems’ more than 30 years developing unmanned aircraft systems and has surpassed 1.3 million hours in flight in support of global military operations for U.S. troops and their allies.

With its multi-domain expertise and proven systems integration experience Textron Systems is at the forefront of all-domain modernization for next-generation vehicles aircraft weapons and electronic systems. As a proven systems integrator the company can deliver purpose-built capabilities with the confidence to adapt with speed economy and unmatched service and support.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8xMS8yMDIyLW5iYWEtYnVzaW5lc3MtYXZpYXRpb24tY29udmVudGlvbi1leGhpYml0aW9uLW5iYWEtYmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE),"Let’s connect!

I am looking forward to meeting all the industry experts at the 2022 NBAA-BACE. I will be sharing content with you and showcasing the latest Business Aviation and technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmVpZ25hZmZhaXJzLmNvbS9jaGluYS9jb21pbmctY2hpbmVzZS13ZWFwb25zLWJvb23SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Coming Chinese Weapons Boom: Beijing is Poised to Dominate the Low End of the Arms Market,"Shortly after Russia’s annual military expo concluded in August Alexander Mikheyev the head of the country’s state arms export agency predicted that revenues from Russian arms exports in 2022 would be down 26 percent from last year. Russia remains the world’s second-largest arms exporter after the United States according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute; it would take a far larger drop in revenues to change that. But it has become clear that since Moscow’s disastrous decision to invade Ukraine in February the Russian military’s need to replace its own equipment U.S.-led sanctions and buyers’ concerns about Russian equipment’s performance on the battlefield have reduced Russia’s ability to export weapons.

While Washington dominates the global market in high-end high-tech weapons Russia has carved out a place for itself as the world’s leading supplier of the capable and cost-effective but lower-tech weapons that are sometimes described as “value arms.” These include new variants of Soviet and Russian equipment such as T-72 and T-80 tanks towed artillery pieces like the D-30 self-propelled howitzers like the 2S1 Gvozdika and 2S19 Msta self-propelled multiple rocket launchers such as the BM-27 Uragan and BM-30 Smerch the S-300 missile defense system and armored personnel carriers such as the BMP-3 and BTR-70. Although lower-income countries such as Myanmar Zambia and Zimbabwe buy only weapons in this category middle-income countries such as Brazil India and Thailand that participate in segments of the high-end market also purchase large supplies of value arms. In 2022 defense spending by the mainly African Asian and Latin American countries that compose the value market totaled $246 billion.

Since American firms typically do not compete in the value arms market Russia’s difficulties have created a vacuum. And the country poised to fill it is China. If left unchecked Beijing could use defense equipment sales to build stronger relationships with ruling elites and to secure foreign basing potentially restricting the U.S. military’s capacity to maneuver across the globe. Expanding Chinese arms sales would undermine U.S. influence in the ongoing geostrategic competition. But that outcome is not yet inevitable. There is still time for the United States and its allies to provide substitutes for Russian weapons at affordable prices and thus to thwart China’s ambitions.

POISED FOR DOMINATION

China boasts six of the 25 largest defense firms in the world. Although China’s current five percent share of the global arms market is significantly lower than Russia’s 19 percent this indicates China’s potential to expand its market share. China has several distinct advantages that could allow it to dominate the value market.

China’s approach to arms exports is transactional unencumbered by concerns about human rights or regime stability. China exchanges weapons not only for financial renumeration but also for access to recipient states’ ports and natural resources. In part by supplying value arms like radars missiles and armored vehicles to Venezuela and Iran for example Beijing has secured steady access to oil from those countries.

China’s approach to arms exports is transactional unencumbered by concerns about human rights or regime stability.

China’s experience as a licensed producer of certain kinds of Russian military equipment has increased its customer appeal in the value arms market. For example after China and Russia signed a strategic partnership agreement in 1996 China was licensed to produce its Russian Su-27Sk Flanker B fighter aircraft. Such arrangements have helped make China the second-biggest supplier to Angola Nigeria and Uganda and the biggest supplier to Bangladesh and Myanmar—all places where Russia does brisk business.

Even before Russia’s present difficulties China had diversified its product offerings to replicate Russia’s strategy of producing affordable substitutes for high-tech Western armaments. Most sub-Saharan African countries operate Chinese weapons but sales to the region constitute only 19 percent of Chinese exports. More than 75 percent of Chinese exports go to Asian countries where China has begun to expand its industrial production network. Pakistan for example now co-produces many Chinese weapons systems such as the Al-Khalid tank and the JF-17 Thunder fighter jet. More recently in addition to value arms China has begun selling higher-end weapons systems to prominent clients: in April it began selling antiaircraft missiles to Serbia and in June Argentina signaled interest in JF-17 fighter jets. China is now the world’s largest exporter of drones and it has begun to sell its Wing Loong and the CH-4 models to customers that used to buy British French Russian and U.S. drones—a list of countries that includes Egypt Iraq Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

China’s long tradition of acquiring foreign technology gives it a leg up in the value market. An official approach called “introduce digest absorb and re-innovate” rolled out in 2006 encourages Chinese companies to “to acquire foreign technology and then ‘re-innovate’ those products for domestic markets.” These efforts reduce development costs and help improve the quality of Chinese-produced weapons.

A final advantage concerns rare earth elements a group of 17 metals including erbium and neodymium which are critical to manufacturing some of the most modern defense equipment. Since mining and processing rare earth elements produces high volumes of toxic waste China’s lax environmental regulations have helped it to dominate the global trade in these metals. China has restricted sales of rare earth elements to coerce other countries in the past and threatened to restrict sales to the United States in 2019 in response to then U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods. If China were to restrict exports of rare earth elements to the United States it could hinder production of high-end systems including the F-35—not to mention guided munitions aircraft and the many other technologies that rely on these minerals for their production.

RISKS TO THE U.S.

Expanded Chinese participation in the value arms market could expand its geopolitical reach while reducing U.S. access to foreign ports and bases. China has already used arms sales to secure military basing rights and to reorient recipient governments away from U.S. influence. The Solomon Islands’ refusal to allow port calls by American and British naval vessels in August just a few months after signing a security agreement with China in April could herald a new era in which U.S. global maneuver capability is increasingly challenged.

To thwart China’s ambitions in the value arms market the United States should help its partners develop production capabilities of their own. U.S. firms need not directly participate in the value arms market but the U.S. government can work closely with allied nations to meet that market’s needs.

To allow the United States and its allies to compete in the value market the U.S. should reform portions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) a regulatory regime that restricts the export of military technologies. While protecting the United States’ technological advantage remains critical to national security the United States should establish ITAR sunsetting parameters to facilitate the export of older weapons and to allow its partners to begin producing them. To facilitate partnerships between U.S. firms and foreign defense industries the United States should also create a petition system to remove ITAR restrictions on individual products. American engagement with allied manufacturers allows the United States to retain a presence in the value market when direct participation is difficult. Targeted ITAR reforms could facilitate the formation of a coalition of arms-producing states that outcompetes China for the value market.

To thwart China’s ambitions the U.S. should help its partners develop production capabilities of their own.

The United States should provide incentives—such as tax cuts and write-offs—for U.S. firms to co-produce affordable quality weapons with partner countries. The United States could work with South Korea and India on improving their Golden Eagle and Tejas jet trainer and light combat aircrafts South Korea’s K9 Thunder howitzer and India’s light tank for the value market.

The United States should actively support American firms’ participation in the value market. In 2018 for example the Defense Department decided not to purchase Textron’s Scorpion fighter a jet designed to perform light attack and armed surveillance. When the U.S. Air Force stopped working on its air certification Washington unintentionally signaled its lack of commitment likely pushing away international clients. Although the Pentagon allegedly wanted a turbo-prop aircraft that was cheaper to procure the Scorpion was relatively inexpensive to operate and likely competitive on the value market. In this case and in others it would have been helpful if the U.S. government had certified its airworthiness and the Commerce Department advocated with foreign governments.

U.S. engagement in the value market will also strengthen its own supply chain and industrial base by supporting partners’ industries diversifying U.S. suppliers and politically engaging value market importers. In 2022 the National Defense Industrial Association a trade association for U.S. defense contractors rated the U.S. industrial base as unsatisfactory for the first time. The blame went to a number of factors: supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic skilled labor shortages shaky budgetary commitments from Congress and cybersecurity-related vulnerabilities. The above proposed reforms will facilitate U.S. defense industrial base resiliency strengthen allies and counter Chinese expansion.

China’s growing grip over the value market will allow it to challenge U.S. interests by increasing China’s access to policy elites in the global South widening access for its military via bases and port facilities and supplementing its defense industry. By deepening industrial cooperation with its allies and encouraging them to join the value arms market the United States can not only gain a strategic advantage over its main rival but also strengthen bonds with its friends."

The panel was validated and registered under IVDD in May 2022.

The new test leverages polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to analyze stool samples for a range of common GI bacteria including Salmonella spp.; Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC); Campylobacter jejuni Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter upsaliensis. It is able to reliably return results in about two hours with more than 98 percent sensitivity and specificity. In comparison culturing samples in a laboratory can take up to two weeks to deliver results.

“The TaqPath Enteric Bacterial Select Panel’s ability to identify and differentiate between the most common diarrhea-causing pathogens will make testing more accessible and provide laboratorians with more agility when identifying GI bacteria” said Dr. Manoj Gandhi senior medical director of Genetic Testing Solutions at Thermo Fisher Scientific. “Detecting these different pathogens in a single test can preserve precious lab resources while still providing clinicians critical information needed to make the right treatment decisions for their patients.”

Testing using the TaqPath Enteric Bacterial Select Panel can be done in one test tube and can be scaled up to fit the needs of the lab by enabling up to 93 samples to be tested in one run. When conducted on Thermo Fisher’s QuantStudio 5 and QuantStudio 5 Dx systems results from samples are interpreted and generated automatically helping to save laboratorian’s time so they can focus on other tasks.

The practice will be the first of its kind at a local high school for the UTEP men's basketball team. Fans will not only have an opportunity to get their first look at the all-new 2022-23 roster but they will also be able to meet Coach Golding and the Miners after the workout.

I love this concept for Coach Golding and his team and I have always believed that conducting special events at local high school gyms is a terrific way to bond the El Paso community with the Miners. I hope that becomes an annual event and UTEP will conduct similar workouts at other El Paso high schools.

In other news the Miners will play a pair of closed scrimmages later this month. Jeff Goodman reported that on Saturday October 22nd Tarleton State will scrimmage the Miners at the Don Haskins Center and one week later UTEP will play Texas Tech in Lubbock. These scrimmages are not open to fans or media.

Former UTEP head coach Doc Sadler will be returning to El Paso on November 1st for the second annual ""Dinner in the Don"" event. Sadler led the Miners to an NCAA Tournament and NIT appearance in his two seasons as UTEP head coach. He arrived as an assistant to Billy Gillispie and was extremely popular with the UTEP fan base. Coach Golding will preview his 2022-23 team to all attendees. Jon Teicher will emcee the event with proceeds benefiting the UTEP men's basketball program. Tickets to ""Dinner at the Don"" are priced at $50 and they include a cash bar. Tables of eight are also available for purchase at $1000 and they include one student athlete or coach.

The closing of the acquisition is anticipated to be completed on October 12 2022. The Company will acquire a net 81 stores and divest the remaining 85 stores to two buyers approved by the FTC. The net purchase price of the 81 stores acquired and retained is approximately $238 million before working capital adjustments. The acquisition is anticipated to generate an estimated future tax benefit of approximately $20 million.

“Today is an important day for Tractor Supply as this acquisition expands our ability to better serve our customers in the Midwest. We are committed to providing customers in the region with an elevated product assortment a meaningful loyalty offering an enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer” said Hal Lawton Tractor Supply’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Importantly Tractor Supply is on track to achieve several monumental milestones in the growth of our company including annual revenues in excess of $14 billion a store base of over 2100 Tractor Supply locations and a highly engaged workforce of 50000 Team Members. We are excited to build on our track record of long-term growth as we look to unlock revenue and earnings opportunities with this attractive acquisition that enhances our growth profile.”

Lawton continued “While agreeing to this remedy with the FTC took longer than we anticipated the outcome is in line with our expectations. We are very pleased with the high-quality locations that will be converted to Tractor Supply stores. I want to thank the Team Members from both companies for their contributions and focus on caring for our customers during the extended review with the FTC. With a shared culture and values we are excited to welcome the team to Tractor Supply and look forward to an exciting future going forward. We are honored to build on the legacy of Barry Orscheln and the team.”

Financial Terms of the Acquisition

The deal is an all-cash transaction that Tractor Supply anticipates financing through its balance sheet. The Company will acquire 166 Orscheln Farm and Home stores for approximately $320 million before working capital adjustments. As part of the remedy reached with the FTC Tractor Supply will divest 85 locations to two buyers Bomgaars Supply Inc. (73 stores) and Buchheit Enterprises Inc. (12 stores) shortly after closing the transaction. Proceeds of the store divestitures will be approximately $72 million. In addition Tractor Supply has agreed to sell the Orscheln Farm and Home corporate headquarters and distribution center to Bomgaars for approximately $10 million within 15 months after the closing of the transaction.

The store divestitures and sale of the corporate headquarters and distribution center bring the net purchase price of the 81 stores acquired to approximately $238 million before working capital adjustments. The acquisition is anticipated to generate an estimated future tax benefit of approximately $20 million.

Financial Details and Outlook

Additional transaction highlights include:

For the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 the revenue from the acquisition is anticipated to add about $75 million to Tractor Supply’s net sales. Given the transaction expenses and early implementation costs to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 the impact of the acquisition is expected to be relatively neutral to operating income in the quarter and for the year.

For fiscal 2023 the revenue from the acquisition is anticipated to add at least $300 million to Tractor Supply’s net sales and be accretive by at least $0.10 to diluted earnings per share. This considers anticipated integration expenses that will partially offset accretion in year one of the acquisition.

The Company is raising its outlook for store growth opportunities to 2800 locations an increase of 100 stores.

According to a staff report by Associate Planner Scott Greeley Gary Price of Miner Joaquin Building Corporation out of Stockton subtitled an application in March for a trio of buildings totaling 12600 square feet on a vacant 2.12-acre site next to Tractor Supply Co.

The first building is reserved for Bank of Stockton a regional community bank that was founded in Stockton and currently has 20 locations throughout California including branches in Fairfield and Rio Vista.

The Dixon location would be its third in Solano County and would be featured at the northwestern edge of the property. Included in its design is a drive-thru that would accommodate up to 11 cars Greeley wrote.

The second building would have space for up to two tenants one of which would have an outdoor patio area and drive-thru for up to eight cars in an effort to potentially attract a restaurant.

The third building located on the northeastern corner of the lot would not have a drive-thru but would have an outdoor patio again opening up the possibility for a restaurant.

In recent years the corner of North First and Vaughn has grown from a mostly vacant plot to a growing commercial set up developments with chains such as Grocery Outlet Panda Express Starbucks and Verizon Wireless. Additionally 100 single-family homes and a Rotten Robbie gas station were approved for the area across the street from the project by the City Council but have not been constructed yet.

Greeley wrote that staff is supportive of the project.

This project provides a high quality new commercial development at a key gateway into the City” he wrote. “The applicant has provided a good design and technical studies to show that the project is appropriate for the site and that a larger project with residential components is likely financially infeasible in Dixon. As such staff is recommending that the Planning Commission conditionally adopt the resolution approving the Bank of Stockton’s Design Review and Conditional Use Permit.”

In other business the commission will receive an update on the comprehensive zoning ordinance overhaul featuring information from recent workshops and a survey.

The commission will meet at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the Council Chambers at City Hall 600 East A St. The meeting can also be viewed live at Cityofdixon.us/MeetingAgendasMinutesVideos and the public may also participate via Zoom at Us02web.zoom.us/j/9886211137?pwd=R2dxZ3RkbU9SQXdlUVllRkc0QlQwZz09 or teleconferencing at (669) 900-9128.

Those expectations haven't yet been met but hoteliers say there have at least been some promising signs of life.

During the recent Lodging Industry Investment Council Meeting at the 2022 Lodging Conference Hotel News Now asked industry experts about the state of business travel.

""Business transient is just different. It's not that sort of workhorse Monday through Thursday like it was pretty tried-and-true before the pandemic. It's just going to shift and be different. We're gonna have to figure out what the new normal is. But people are traveling to meet with people. ... You do things via Zoom until you lose your first deal because the other guy went and met in person. There's a lot more of that happening and ... that's transcending across industries not just hospitality.""

Mike Cahill CEO and co-founder HREC

""At least from our perspective as a broker we had the two years of the pandemic and now I'm trying to get everyone back on the road. I just did two and a half days in Minneapolis. I may be getting too old for it but you set that agenda breakfast meeting two meetings lunch meeting two meetings dinner meeting and you get in front of people as opposed to on Zoom or a phone call where other things can pop up. Competition and capitalism are going to get people on the road and salespeople are going to lead the way.""

Jonathan Bogatay CEO NCG Hospitality

""We're seeing a trend in some of our markets where you have a company that did a lot of business with international suppliers. Well with the supply chain that's become a problem but they had these big contracts that were negotiated so the regional supplier never could get their foot in the door. Now all of a sudden they're out knocking on the doors meeting with procurement departments. They're able to get that contract. They're traveling [and that is] really starting to pay dividends. A lot of companies are pivoting and doing business with regional and local providers because of supply chain issues. Those are [hotel room] nights that we're picking up — one- to two-night stays on a Tuesday and Wednesday and that feels a lot like traditional business travel. The differences is it's not Accenture and IBM that are the mega companies. It's more of these regional type of providers. That's the more nimble company that's getting on the road getting in front of the customers whereas the bigger behemoths are struggling to mobilize.""

Mike DeNicola principal EMA Lodging

""Business travel has been missing and part of it is because people aren't in the office. Just take San Antonio and [financial services firm] USAA. We used to have their business. You'd have the accounting consulting firms come in to USAA and basically be there for four days during the week go home for the weekend come back the next four days and they'd be there for months at a time. To us that was business transient [demand]. It really was project business but was recorded as business transient. That business is not back yet and it's not back anywhere because nobody's in the office long enough. You're not going to have [PwC] come into your office and the people aren't there to work with. That's still a huge segment. That's about to come back ... because at some point you're going to have to deal with your technology issues your accounting issues your systems issues; and you're going to bring in these project teams. ...

""Because projects and the big firms like IBM aren't back [our sales teams are] totally focused on local corporate businesses and local business.""

Jim Butler founding partner Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell

""This is a wake-up call for everybody. As a lawyer or accountant Zoom calls have proven to be incredibly efficient. We all have gotten into them and appreciate how that has done a lot. But literally last week we're working with a client and there are three consultants we're working with on a very significant problem ... but two of those consultants came to visit the site with with the company. I'm looking at that and what a difference it makes when somebody shows the interest and is there walking the property. A Zoom call is never going to do that.""

David Duncan president and CEO First Hospitality Group

""The lack of business travel is sort of the hole in the doughnut. How do you fill it in? Monday at many of our assets was always the busiest night for check-ins. Thursday is now the busiest night for check-ins because of that business-leisure bleisure thing. What we're finding is the traditional large group ... is much less on; and with smaller groups sales teams have to be much more dynamic with shorter windows and figuring out how to use them to fill the hole in the doughnut. We're changing our sales structure. We don't just call PricewaterhouseCoopers anymore; we call all of them. That's where a lot of the work happens. But fundamentally there is a lack of demand from business travel filled in with leisure or upended travel on top of business. The large traditional corporate consultancy groups are still not on the road at the same level as they have been. And the real question is will they ever be? Or can they work remotely like a lot of us have gotten used to?""

Andrea Foster senior vice president of development Marcus Hotels & Resorts

""Don't forget about the hyper-commuters. Look at my situation — I moved to the D.C. area but I'm back in Milwaukee for about a week every two months or so. We own hotels so I can stay in our hotels and it doesn't cost money. But if we weren't a hotel company then the company is paying more — or I'm paying however the structure would work — to stay in a hotel for that period of time which is demand that didn't happen. That's another thing that our sales teams are focused on. Who's moved who's traveling and how do we connect to capture that business? Our company's back in the office but I happen to be a unique individual who is living elsewhere so I'm traveling. With companies and individuals we have to parse who's traveling and what their needs are. It's just it's different than it was before.""

Aik Hong Tan founding principal Greenwood Hospitality

""Obviously there are big conventions like this. This is a big one. But those large groups that we talked about we're not there yet from a corporate standpoint. We do see small groups companies that are trying to bring their people back together rebuild the relationships. They are short-term bookings but obviously social association and sports [groups] are still fairly strong.""

Mitra Van managing director Prism Hotels & Resorts

""What we did at our properties is we made everybody a salesperson. Even on the front desk especially during COVID we have taught them trained them that whoever comes through the door you have to find out why they're there. What is their reason for traveling and what is their plan for coming back? And it really does work out.""

Digital Iris is the newest member of the DFW team and the world’s first example of the Soul Machines’ “Digital Person” product built to assist airport visitors at information kiosks. Inspired by in-depth research of traveler needs Digital Iris is a hyper-realistic animated digital persona who can hear see understand and communicate with appropriate facial expressions and gestures based on the responses and expressions shown by the customer – all in real-time. Since the pilot program’s initial rollout in June Digital Iris has been operating in Terminal B and has already managed thousands of conversations.

Digital Iris provides travelers with up-to-the-minute location-based information on Flight and Gate Information Restaurant Information Interactive Map Detail Airport Support and Service Details all with empathy and engagement. Completely touchless Digital Iris elevates the customer experience with voice-controlled on-demand answers to questions in a way similar to how passengers would naturally interact with a human airport representative. Digital Iris’ likeness and animation were created by Soul Machines and its speech and artificial intelligence were built using IBM’s Watson Assistant technology. While Soul Machines provides Digital Iris’ subconscious AI comprised of emotional detection and response as well as autonomous animation Watson Assistant provides conscious AI response such as understanding questions and providing responses.

Digital Iris was designed to augment airport support staff and help service guests who tend to be less frequent travelers and less comfortable leveraging online resources. Each kiosk where Digital Iris resides has a directional microphone speaker and camera. The camera gives Digital Iris vision to detect a customer and the mic enables Digital Iris to hear passengers' unique requests. DFW plans to expand the use of Digital Iris throughout the airport so it can continue to learn and evolve its organizational knowledge over time.

“In an era when the air travel industry is up against serious logistical challenges maximizing both efficiency and customer experience is more important than ever” said Greg Cross CEO of Soul Machines. “That’s why the work of DFW to embrace the concept of Digital People and introduce Digital Iris to its travelers is commendable. With core functions powered by Soul Machines artificial intelligence capabilities being driven from an industry leader IBM and guidance and feedback from DFW’s teams Digital Iris continues to pioneer the autonomous animation revolution. As the airport’s travelers are already discovering the potential of visual AI is huge and we are only just scratching the surface of what’s possible.”

“AI and automation are providing businesses with the capabilities they need to deliver more personalized and seamless customer care experiences while enabling their employees to focus on complex higher value tasks” said Dinesh Nirmal General Manager for Data AI and Automation at IBM. “The launch of the Digital Iris solution at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport is a great example of how AI can be applied to set a new standard for travelers and help support airport employees.”

Soul Machines AI technology controls Digital Iris' CGI-based appearance and animation and interface to AI and Enterprise platforms. Soul Machines' Autonomous Animation drives real-time gestures including lip sync gaze facial muscles head motion and behavioral mannerism all emotionally appropriate to the intensity of the conversation. IBM Watson Assistant allows Digital Iris to understand the verbal requests of passengers. It has a complete toolchain of Speech-to-Text (STT) conversational analytics and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. In addition to enabling an interactive conversation the AI technology connects via APIs to data sources like flight information weather etc.

IBM Watson Assistant uses AI designed to understand customers in context to help provide fast consistent and accurate answers across applications devices or channels. IBM Watson Assistant has been deployed by clients around the world and across a range of industries to deliver powerful customer care experiences such as responding to time-sensitive COVID-19 inquiries helping citizens get more information on voting procedures helping insurers provide more personalized services and more.

The company which courts twentysomething and thirtysomething travelers said it had suffered a loss of about $4 million (adjusted earnings before interest taxation and amortization) while generating revenue of $86 million.

If the lodging company goes public as planned — something it has repeatedly teased — investors will pressure it to deliver profits. The company said on Tuesday it expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange through a merger with BOA Acquisition Corp a special purpose acquisition company soon.

The group previewed in its financial filings a new sub-brand Sims which will produce music festivals and large-scale events mostly at Selina venues. It also revealed another new brand Mantra which will run wellness retreats for companies and consumers with a majority also produced at Selina locations. Adding experiential elements help increase repeat bookings and word-of-mouth marketing for its hotels and hostels the company said.

“We remain focused on achieving profitability as we grow and scale our platform and continue to progress towards near-profitable margins” said Rafael Museri Selina’s co-founder and CEO in a statement. Its first-half loss this year was roughly half the one in 2021.

Few brands owned by global hotel companies are developed for millennial and Gen Z travelers. The rarities are Marriott with its Aloft and Moxy brands; IHG with its Even brand; Accor-backed brands Mama Shelter Treebo and The Hoxton; and Tru by Hilton.

Selina believes there’s a mismatch between supply and demand given that the lodging spending by young people will soon account for a majority of hospitality revenue. It forecast that more than 2 million young people would visit its property for lodging co-working or food and beverage this year. The company plans to grow its “coworking recreation wellness and local experiences in sought-after destinations” which it said would give the company an edge in appealing to millennial and Gen-Z travelers.

TRMB,Trimble Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmlzdXJ2LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzEwL2l0cy1hLWxvbmctd2F5LXRvLXRoZS10b3Av0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's a Long Way to the Top,"American Surveyor caught up with Frontier Precision Founder & CEO Dennis Kemmesat at Trimble Dimensions 2022 to discuss what’s working for today’s most progressive geospatial service providers and what it takes to support such a diverse group. Since co-founding the company in 1988 Dennis has seen a thing or two regarding surveyors and the infamous “technology adoption curve”. Today technicians can drive fly or walk a project transitioning away from more static methods to working directly with models in the field. With clients realizing the value of geospatial data there’s never been a more exciting time to be involved.

Frontier Precision Inc. headquartered in Bismarck North Dakota is a supplier of hardware and software products and related services for customers in geospatial and adjacent markets across large areas of the US. It is best known as a Trimble distributor but has grown to embrace offerings from multiple suppliers and extend beyond a purely geospatial customer base.

AS: Dennis thanks for taking time to catch up with us. As we’re here at Dimensions what’s on your mind?

DK: Each time we visit this event we’re reminded of not only how far Trimble and the user community has come but how expansive the modern opportunity is. Incredibly it feels like we haven’t even scratched the surface. You may have seen during one of the keynotes that an estimated 15 billion acres is in need of mapping and the need is constant from cities to remote locations infrastructure and everything in between.

Years ago when land surveying was the “simple” focus it was exciting to see surveyors implementing GPS and then Real Time Networks. Since the first Dimensions back in 2003 this has become so much more something that touches nearly every aspect of society (GeoTech that is) and we’re proud to be a part of it. Trimble likes to say that their technology allows surveyors to bridge physical and digital worlds—we’re set up to support customers that are eager to do that.

AS: Can you talk about how they’ve brought it together for those that aren’t familiar?

DK: Survey is at the heart of so many industries. Trimble recognized this long ago and began developing applications in Trimble Access vertically specific apps to be clear. For example within DOTs (for inspectors); previously a solution would’ve been survey focused but now it’s workflow specific. Or construction companies—years ago construction firms had nothing to do with surveyors. Now they employ surveyors if not a survey department.

Trimble has changed the way we work. Stakeholders want more data so they can in turn make better decisions… Realizing that even a single technician generates a tremendous amount of information solutions now exist to bring an entire jobsite or project to a planner’s desktop. Scott Crozier at Trimble likes to say that they’ve made survey chores enjoyable that perhaps no geospatial professional is more skilled or capable of bringing the digital and physical worlds together (than surveyors).

AS: Indeed they spoke today about the “data rich industrial metaverse” working directly with models in the field. That and wanting their customers to connect and scale.

DK: Indeed Trimble Cloud makes this possible and is driving industry transformation as they say. It’s also important to note that the fusion of various survey technologies is what allows this not one single technology. As a premier distributor we carry and support most all key product lines and can explain how and where they come together.

We see Trimble Business Center (TBC) Trimble Connect and Trimble Access as three legs of a stool. Thanks to these three tools customers with data collection and/or management expertise can deliver the data needed to support BIM smart cities digital twin etc.

AS: The technologies are no doubt impressive but there’s still an obvious need for resellers. Where do you help clients most?

DK: 10-15 years ago Trimble had perhaps 3x as many dealers as they do currently. Over time they realized that they were better off with bigger better partnerships to help grow their business. In my opinion they wanted groups with not just deep roots and a strong track record but insight at the end of the day the means to be self-sufficient. When all is said and done it’s about a better end user experience which is what we aim to provide. That and the fact that I believe we’ve earned their trust which is the underlying reason for the success of most any partnership. We understand what they’re trying to do—ultimately when they bring a solution we’ll find them a (sales) channel.

AS: Please tell us about your territory if you could.

DK: Sure. We have just over 100 people. For our geospatial business we have 10 physical locations covering 11 states across the northern plains mountain states and Pacific Northwest including North Dakota Minnesota South Dakota Colorado Wyoming Montana Idaho Oregon Washington Alaska and Hawaii.

Frontier Precision Unmanned Division has personnel in several of our geospatial locations plus its own physical locations in Bend Oregon Fort Worth Texas and Jacksonville Florida with more being planned. We continually grow by acquisition.

AS: Do most all of your locations house support and training facilities?

DK: Soup to nuts. Service and repair does not require territory the way equipment sales does so we’re able to rent and repair nationally. It’s important to note that gear comes to us not Trimble.

As for rental we offer of course the full complement of GNSS receivers robots scanners and data collectors. In addition many firms come to us for systems like the MX9 or MX50 mobile scanners. Rather than buy they hope to learn the tech (first) or get an idea of whether they can make money with it before making the leap. Whether renting or selling I believe we’ve got the most knowledgeable folks in the industry when it comes to mobile scanning and lidar which brings a high level of comfort and confidence for our customers to make that leap into the mobile mapping world.

AS: Where do you see UAV/UAS technology headed from a surveying perspective? Is this technology essential to compete moving forward?

DK: I foresee UAV technology becoming a standard tool for every surveyor especially when it is coupled with high-res cameras for photogrammetry or with lidar. Of course the sensors are a small part of the equation: the back-end software is equally important – ease of use for photogrammetry processing or point-cloud processing is becoming more common with workflows that are easy to understand and learn. This was a hurdle early on for both photogrammetry and lidar—workflows were complicated and processing was time-consuming requiring a lot of computing power. We now are seeing many cloud-based software platforms that are simplifying the whole process.

AS: Lastly if you were operating a land surveying or geomatics business today what would you emphasize?

DK: Be an early adopter – not bleeding edge but leading edge. The maturity and efficiencies of technology in our industry simply cannot be ignored – companies in the survey/mapping and construction industries are either embracing and adopting it or finding it very tough to compete with companies that are. In the present state of our economy and workforce this also becomes important as qualified workers are becoming harder to find every day. The efficiencies of today’s technology allow more work to be done faster with fewer people so a company can scale without necessarily adding workforce and other overhead and maintain a healthy bottom line.

AS: Thanks Dennis. The technology is exciting but easily overwhelming for many so the need for a group such as yours is obvious. Best of luck to you and your team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsZWV0b3duZXIuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTI1MDU1Mi90cnVja2luZ3MtdGVsZW1hdGljcy1kYXRhLWludGVncmF0aW9uLWRpbGVtbWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trucking's telematics data integration dilemma,"For coaching Lytx allows fleet managers to set alerts for certain types of driver behaviors which drivers can self-correct before alerts are sent to the back office. For example if a driver is eating drinking or smoking an in-cab device will notify the driver in real time. If the driver changes his or her behavior right away managers aren’t informed.

“We allow drivers to change their behavior on their own which in turn significantly reduces the burden from fleets so they don’t have to coach their drivers” Rudraradhya said. “It’s a self-sustaining loop. Based on Lytx data we see that 80% of the drivers self-correct.”

One trend that Trimble’s Orban sees is a push toward more apps for drivers as well as drivers asking for certain apps and functionality on their devices. He did however emphasize the importance of overloading both drivers and back-office staff with too many apps and alerts.

Ultimately anything that gives the driver a choice goes a long way for the fleet Orban added.

An ongoing evolution

Tracing back vehicle connectivity to when it first started—some 20 years ago—it was all about geolocation and asset tracking according to Nada Jiddou EVP and general manager for Road Ready advanced telematics at Clarience. Then came the introduction of smart devices IoT principles data analytics and other capabilities in the connected vehicle ecosystem.

“That evolution of connectivity into IoT solutions and a telematics system has been key in the next inflection point within the industry where data becomes the driver for connectivity and the smart network is also more in demand now” Jiddou explained. “Users are no longer just interested in where the asset is but they also want to know the health state of the asset and what exactly is wrong with the asset or the vehicle for them to provide comprehensive maintenance and preventive maintenance.”

As the trucking industry continues to face pressures from a struggling global supply chain preventive maintenance practices become more important in keeping older assets in operation longer according to telematics provider ConMet.

“In the face of these challenges fleets are seeking new methods for managing their aging assets cost-effectively and with as little disruption to their business as possible” ConMet stated. “This is pushing the industry toward investing in more sophisticated telematics systems.”

Amid these developments and the need for more sophisticated systems data privacy and management are also at the forefront of fleet concerns Jiddou added.

Because no one supplier can offer it all today many telematics companies are intent on integrating their systems with other industry-leading providers. Clarience Technologies for example has acquired several telematics companies including Road Ready Fleetilla and P.S.I. among several others to offer a wider range of solutions to fleets.

“These partnerships allow us to offer capabilities that we alone might not be able to do” Jiddou added. “It allows us to bring in all the data from the different providers and translate it into meaningful data that we can show on a single pane of glass for the fleet depending on what they are interested in at any given time.”

Trimble’s Orban agreed that absolute integration will be key moving forward.

“Fleets have brought it up shippers have brought it up everybody wants integration and wants the data to flow smoothly” he said. “Nobody wants the driver to enter anything manually. I want the driver spending all their time behind the wheel not worrying about whether they mistyped a bill of lading or whether they put in a correct trailer number.”

Alex Jensen senior manager of brand and communications at Lytx also reiterated the importance of having open platforms to drive innovation.

“There’s a lot of market stress right now with supply chain and driver shortage” Jensen said. “That’s the advantage of an open platform—you are sharing the data with a larger community and benefiting from the network not hoarding the data and innovating in your own laboratory all by yourself.”

CFL’s Reardon is optimistic about seeing many smaller telematics companies being absorbed by some of the bigger players to solve the integration problem.

“Everyone I talk to in this industry has the same problem” Reardon said. “Fleets need to provide upper-level management with the data they need to run the business and give the finance and operations people the data we are going to run on and survive on.

If the uniforms didn’t give it away just look at the matchups. There’s a reason the Phillies will enter Game 1 of the National League Division Series as heavy underdogs to reach their first National League Championship Series since that brutal loss to Cody Ross and the Giants in 2010.

It starts with pitching. And the pitching will start with Max Fried.

While the Cardinals were essentially forced to pick between four No. 3 starters when deciding whom to match up against Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola in last weekend’s wild-card series the Braves feature a trio of young arms who each has the makings of an ace. In Games 1 and 2 the Phillies will square off against Max Fried and Kyle Wright who have combined to hold opponents under two runs in 38 of their 60 starts this season.

As for Game 3 the Braves have yet to announce a starter but 23-year-old rookie Spencer Strider might have been the most talented pitcher on the whole staff before an oblique injury cost him the last two weeks of the regular season. Since moving into the rotation in early June the righty has held opposing hitters to a .180/.249/.265 batting line with a 2.62 ERA 158 strikeouts and 32 walks in 103 innings. In his last seven starts Strider has allowed two home runs and 11 walks in 42 innings while posting a 1.71 ERA with a 13.7 strikeouts-per-nine average. The Braves have won six of those seven games. If Strider can’t go the Braves can call on the battle-tested Charlie Morton.

» READ MORE: NL Division Series: Five subplots to Phillies vs. Braves

Even better might be the Braves bullpen which features four veteran setup men with strikeout stuff and ERAs under 2.75 plus closer Kenley Jansen who is coming off a regular season in which he saved 41 games with a 3.38 ERA while striking out 12.0 batters per nine.

Daunting? Sure. But there is a path to victory and this is what it looks like.

1. Braves starters have been 20% worse while pitching on six-plus days of rest than they have while pitching on four days of rest.

Before the Cardinals series I was talking to someone in the Phillies’ baseball ops department who said they were interested to see how the Dodgers and the Braves would respond to going five days between the end of the regular season and their first playoff game. Baseball is a sport in which rest can be a double-edged sword.

Look at the ERA of Braves starters this season based on the days of rest they have before an outing:

Four days of rest: 3.37 ERA 2.79 strikeouts per walk Five days of rest: 3.79 ERA 3.52 strikeouts per walk Six days of rest: 4.04 ERA 2.75 strikeouts per walk

» READ MORE: NL Division Series: Everything you need to know about the Braves

Fried hasn’t pitched in a regulation game since Sept. 30. Wright’s last start came on Oct. 1. That’s a layoff of 10 days for both. Strider hasn’t pitched since Sept. 18 because of the oblique injury.

Fried’s splits are especially pronounced. On four or five days’ rest the 28-year-old lefty has averaged 6.25 innings per outing with a 2.21 ERA. On six-plus days’ rest he has averaged 5.78 innings per outing and a 3.63 ERA.

Truth is we have no idea how this year’s new playoff format will impact the higher-seeded teams. At the very least it is an unknown variable.

2. Since joining the Phillies Wheeler has a 2.03 ERA in 10 starts against the Braves.

Not only that but he has recorded an average of 20 outs in those starts. That’s nearly seven innings per start. This year the Phillies beat the Braves in two of Wheeler’s three regular-season starts. In those outings Atlanta scored a total of nine runs six of them against Wheeler who struck out 25 and walked only one in 20 innings.

Nola hasn’t been as dominant but the Phillies are 3-2 in his five outings. The Game 3 starter has a 3.67 ERA against the Braves with 41 strikeouts and seven walks in 34⅓ innings. Limiting the long ball will be key for Nola: Atlanta has five home runs against him this year.

Having Wheeler on the mound in Game 2 has a chance to be a huge equalizer in the series. Split in Atlanta and you’ll have Nola on the mound in Game 3 pitching at Citizens Bank Park in the Phillies’ first home playoff game since Game 5 of the 2011 NLDS.

3. In 190 career plate appearances at Truist Park in Atlanta Bryce Harper has a .950 OPS with 23 extra-base hits 12 of them home runs.

The Phillies have spent much of the last month waiting for their MVP to get hot. After returning from the injured list in late August Harper hit just three home runs while batting .227/.325/.352 in his last 151 plate appearances of the regular season. Was his second-inning home run in Game 2 against the Braves the start of one of his epic hot streaks? If so it could change the complexion of the series against the Braves.

» READ MORE: ‘We are not losing this game’: How Bryce Harper’s mantra is setting a tone for the Phillies

“If he gets hot we’re going to be really dangerous” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said after Game 2. “So that’s what we’re waiting for is for him to go on one of those streaks where he’s hitting everything and whether it gets there or not I don’t know but if he gets there yeah it’s going to be — it’s going to be special.”

4. Rhys Hoskins was 0-for-9 with three strikeouts against the Cardinals. In 17 games against the Braves this season he is hitting .246/.319/.492 with 24 strikeouts and three home runs in 65 at-bats.

For the Phillies to have any chance in Game 1 and a potential Game 5 they’ll likely need Hoskins’ right-handed bat to show up against the lefty starter Fried and lefty relievers A.J. Minter and Dylan Lee. Hoskins has one hit in his last 28 at-bats dating back to the regular season. He’s a player who has epitomized the Phillies’ later rebuilding stages. He would do wonders for a legacy with a big series against the Braves.

Epps already serves as the Dean of the Cathedral but will also be assuming the role of Administrative Pastor. In the Charismatic Episcopal Church the bishop of the diocese serves as the Cathedral rector while the Dean serves as the rector during the absences or illnesses of the bishop. A Dean therefore serves in essence as the Senior Associate Pastor while the bishop is present. Should the bishop become incapacitated or is otherwise unable to perform his duties the Dean assumes the pastorate until a new rector is appointed.

Epps was born in Kingsport TN the first of three sons born to David and Dr. Cynthia Douglas Epps. One of his earliest memories was when at age three he gave his heart to Jesus.

Growing up in Georgia Epps earned his black belt in Okinawan Isshin-Ryu karate at age 14 (later earning his 2nd degree black belt) and discovered football. He played Offensive Guard and Defensive End for the McIntosh High School Chiefs and received the 1989 Offensive Lineman of the Year Award. He received a football scholarship to Olivet Nazarene University and later transferred to Georgia State University graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in History.

Jason met and married Jessica Paula Pierce of Griffin GA and after graduation was sworn in as a police officer with the Peachtree City Police Department. He and Jesse are charter members of Christ the King. During his police career he was a patrolman a detective and a supervisor. He was certified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a Hostage Negotiator and in 2000 he received the Police Officer Purple Heart for injuries received in the line of duty.

In 2004 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. Epps served as the senior Firearms Instructor and as a member of the Honor Guard/Saber Team. He was one of a handful of police officers nationwide annually selected to attend and graduate from the prestigious three month-long FBI National Academy in Quantico VA. He served as a Detective Lieutenant in the Criminal Investigations Division until completing his law enforcement career after 20 years of service.

In 2005 Jason began the Master of Ministry Program at Saint Michael’s Seminary and was ordained into the diaconate in the Mid-South Diocese by Bishop John Holloway in 2006. In 2007 Bishop Holloway suffered a massive stroke and Father David Epps was elected to serve as the Bishop of the Diocese of the Mid-South.

Following his graduation from St. Michael’s Seminary with a Master of Ministry degree Epps was ordained to the priesthood by his father. He is a member of the Rector’s Council at Christ the King the Diocesan Bishop’s Council and is also the Diocesan Investigator in the event allegations are lodged against clergy of the diocese. He is president of the Warriors Motorcycle Club a ministry of Christ the King and is the Lead on the Response Team of the Sword and Shield Ministry. Prior to his new position he was a senior project manager for Tyler Technologies the largest software company in the nation solely focused on providing integrated software and technology services to the public sector.

""You're talking about a situation where you have a hollowed out economy where you have businesses leaving there are no jobs"" Heritage Foundation senior research fellow in the Center for Health and Welfare Policy Robert Moffit told Fox News Digital last month. ""And the people who are desperately hurt by this are mostly low income and black and minority residents who suffer the most from this high crime.""

Moffit's comments came after McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski took aim at Chicago in a mid-September speech arguing that the city's rising crime rates have made it increasingly difficult for companies to operate or find employees.

""We have violent crime that's happening in our restaurants ... we're seeing homelessness issues in our restaurants. We're having drug overdoses that are happening in our restaurants"""" Kempczinski said at the time. ""So we see in our restaurants every single day what's happening in society at large.""

CHICAGO FACES MORE CORPORATE DEPARTURES AS TYSON FOODS MOVES TO ARKANSAS

Crime in Chicago has spiked during Black Lives Matter riots and the defund the police movement in the aftermath of the 2020 death of George Floyd with the city recording its deadliest year in a quarter-century in 2021 with 797 homicides.

Chicago Police Department Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy told Fox News Digital over the summer that the city has engaged in a ""stealth defunding"" of the police department by failing to provide adequate resources and staffing to the department as officers leave or retire.

The reality has seen crime rise across nearly every category something businesses are taking note of as they look toward the future.

Billionaire Ken Griffin announced earlier this year that he was moving his hedge-fund firm Citadel out of Chicago because of the rising crime a move that was also made by mining equipment giant Caterpillar and Boeing the world's largest aerospace company.

SKYROCKETING CHICAGO CRIME HAS SMALL BUSINESSES CORPORATIONS PACK THEIR BAGS: 'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH'

""If people aren’t safe here they’re not going to live here"" Griffin told the Wall Street Journal in April. ""I’ve had multiple colleagues mugged at gunpoint. I’ve had a colleague stabbed on the way to work. Countless issues of burglary. I mean that’s a really difficult backdrop with which to draw talent to your city from.""

Chicago has also seen small businesses flee the area with Gary Rabine founder of the Rabine Group and owner of 13 businesses telling Fox News Digital last month that crime was behind his decision to take his rod paving business elsewhere.

""We would do thousands of jobs a year in the city but as we got robbed more my people operating rollers and pavers we got robbed our equipment would get stolen in broad daylight and there would usually be a gun involved and it got expensive and it got dangerous"" Rabine said.

Rabine also pointed out that the rising crime leads to increased costs in other areas pointing to increased expenses in both security for his businesses and insurance rates.

CHICAGO MAYOR LIGHTFOOT TELLS MCDONALD'S CEO TO 'EDUCATE HIMSELF' AFTER HE WARNS OF RISING CRIME

""What happened eventually is we said enough is enough"" Rabine said. ""We stopped doing work down there we stopped doing work for the gas company the electric company the south side the west side and eventually all over Chicago. Those companies now work in other places. They work over the border in Wisconsin the outer suburbs of Chicago where they feel safer.""

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has defended the city in the wake of the exodus arguing business leaders such as Kempczinski don't have a firm understanding of the situation.

""I think what would have been helpful is for the McDonald's CEO to educate himself before he spoke"" the Chicago Democrat told reporters last month pointing to a letter from World Business Chicago President Michael Fassnacht that she argued ""lays out in exact detail all the good news economic news about what’s happening in our city.""

But Kempczinksi wasn't buying the rosy picture painted by city officials.

CHICAGO SMALL BUSINESSES SUFFER FROM CRIME PLAGUE WITH NO 'EFFORT' FROM CITY TO STOP IT

""The fact is that there are fewer large companies headquartered in Chicago this year than last year"" Kempczinski said. ""There are fewer this month than last month.""

Tyson becomes the latest company to contribute to the trend though its leaders stayed away from publicly pointing to rising crime as a driver of the decision.

Bringing our talented corporate team members and businesses together under one roof unlocks greater opportunities to share perspectives and ideas while also enabling us to act quickly to solve problems and provide the innovative products and solutions that our customers deserve and value"" Tyson CEO Donnie King said in a release announcing the decision pointing out that the employees would be moving to the company's global headquarters in Arkansas.

Nevertheless Rabine argued the city will continue to lose businesses as they have a difficult time attracting talent to a city plagued by violence.

""If you want a great culture in your company you have to have people that love being on the team and they don't want to live in a violent area"" Rabine said. ""They don't want to live in a place where their kids can't walk to school safely and their wives and kids can't go shopping in a beautiful environment like Michigan Avenue which was once the safest place you could ever go shopping.""

One of the world's largest meat producers said Wednesday that corporate staff at its Chicago and Downers Grove Illinois locations and Dakota Dunes South Dakota office will begin relocating early next year.

The consolidation of corporate offices is intended to allow for closer collaboration and no layoffs will accompany the shift the company said. Tyson plans to expand and remodel its headquarters in Arkansas.

The parent company of Jimmy Dean and Ball Park products employs about 137000 workers worldwide. The announcement follows some recent high-profile corporate maneuvers including naming John Tyson __ the great-grandson of the company's founder __ as its chief financial officer.

Chicago has had a number of corporate departures in recent months.

Boeing Co. announced in May that it would move its headquarters from Chicago to Arlington Virginia.

The following month construction equipment maker Caterpillar said it was moving its headquarters from the Chicago suburbs to Texas.

Citadel hedge fund CEO Ken Griffin a billionaire who has been a vocal critic of Illinois' Democratic governor and of crime rates in Chicago also recently moved his company's headquarters to Miami.

In a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago last month McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said he often fields calls from mayors and governors trying to get him to move McDonald's headquarters out of Chicago.

Kempczinski said McDonald's has no plans to leave but has struggled with crime and homelessness in its Chicago restaurants.

""While it may wound our civic pride to hear it there is a general sense out there that our city is in crisis"" Kempczinski said adding that it is becoming more difficult for the company to recruit promising employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb3dhcHVibGljcmFkaW8ub3JnL2lwci1uZXdzLzIwMjItMTAtMTEvc2lvdXgtY2l0eS1tYXlvci1hc2tzLXRyaS1zdGF0ZS1nb3Zlcm5vcnMtdG8tcHJldmVudC10eXNvbi1vZmZpY2UtcmVsb2NhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sioux City mayor asks tri-state governors to prevent Tyson office relocation,"Sioux City Mayor Bob Scott called upon the governors of Iowa Nebraska and South Dakota to prevent Tyson Foods from moving more than 500 jobs out of the tri-state area.

The food company will be closing its corporate offices in Dakota Dunes South Dakota – which borders Sioux City. The large community employer will be consolidating all three of its corporate offices to its headquarters in northwest Arkansas.

Scott said Tyson's move will have a terrible impact on the area resulting in the loss of 580 jobs for the area. He asked the tri-state governors – Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem – to step in.

“Go see the people at Tyson write letters do whatever” he said at a city council meeting on Monday evening. “But take the lead on this because they are not going to listen to local communities and it is terribly important that we don’t lose those jobs.”

Employees at the Dakota Dunes office will have to opt to relocate to the corporate headquarters or accept a severance package.

The company's processing plant in Dakota City will not be impacted.

Scott said the Sioux City Chamber of Commerce has been unsuccessful in its attempt to get Tyson to reconsider its decision. In a statement to the Sioux City Journal last week Chamber president Chris McGowan said the organization would work “tirelessly” to assist the impacted employees find new jobs locally.

U.S. Representative Randy Feenstra who represents the 4th Congressional District also issued a statement last week urging the company to reconsider their decision to move the office.

“This decision is absolutely contrary to the values I share with the Siouxland community and represents a complete disregard for the employees and families who have been loyal to Tyson for more than two decades” part of Feenstra’s statement read.

The relocation process will begin in early 2023 according to Tyson Foods announcement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vY2hpY2tlbi1wcmljZS1maXhpbmctbGl0aWdhdGlvbi15aWVsZHMtNTc0LW1sbi1mZWVzLXBsYWludGlmZnMtZmlybXMtMjAyMi0xMC0xMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicken price-fixing litigation yields $57.4 mln in fees for plaintiffs' firms,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/chicken-price-fixing-litigation-yields-574-mln-fees-plaintiffs-firms-2022-10-10/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vY2hpY2tlbi1wcmljZS1maXhpbmctbGl0aWdhdGlvbi15aWVsZHMtNTc0LW1sbi1mZWVzLXBsYWludGlmZnMtZmlybXMtMjAyMi0xMC0xMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Minnesota hopes to change that.

Minnesota Sports and Events which has helped secure events such as the 2018 Super Bowl and last spring’s women’s NCAA Final Four plans to make a bid to bring the Big Ten football championship game to U.S. Bank Stadium as soon as 2025. It would be the first year the game — so far — has not been awarded to Lucas Oil Stadium.

The Big Ten women’s basketball tournament will be at Target Center this spring and next and the men’s tournament will be here in 2023 as well. With the pending addition of UCLA and USC in Fall 2024 the Big Ten will have the nation’s biggest media markets to choose from from the New York Metropolitan Area to Los Angeles and stops in between that include Chicago and the Twin Cities.

Speaking at the first day of Big Ten media days at Target Center Commissioner Kevin Warren sounded ready to continue to branch out.

“Now” he said “we have the flexibility to have (basketball tournaments) really anywhere across the country.”

The Big Ten hasn’t officially opened bidding on the football championship a conference spokesperson said. The request-for-proposal process will cover two years and Minnesota Sports and Events hopes to throw its hat into the ring.

“We have communicated to the Big Ten that our community would love to host Big Ten football championships here at USBS the best stadium in the country” Minnesota Sports and Events president and CEO Wendy Williams Blackshaw said Wednesday.

U.S. Bank Stadium was host to Super Bowl LI in February 2018 and Target Center was host to the women’s Final Four last spring.

“Our region our state continues to build on the great reputation we have developed in executing large-scale events” Blackshaw said.

FOOTBALL ALIGNMENT

How the Big Ten will determine the participants for the 2025 football championship has yet to be determined. With UCLA and USC joining the fold the conference is reassessing its alignment currently two seven-team divisions roughly comprising teams from the Big Ten’s eastern and western regions.

The current set-up awards a championship bid to the winner in each division. Because the East Division includes Ohio State Michigan State and Penn State it has often seemed the actual Big Ten championship game is a regular-season meeting between those East rivals.

A West Division team hasn’t won the title game since Wisconsin won the first two in 2011 and 2012 and Ohio State has won five of the past nine. When asked Wednesday where the Big Ten is with its next alignment plan Warren said “I think your question is about divisions if we’ll continue to have them in football. We’re having meetings on that right now.”

TEAM CZINANO

Monika Czinano didn’t take long to decide to return to Iowa for a fifth basketball season. “It would have felt weird if I wasn’t there” the post player from Watertown Minn. said Wednesday.

That’s because Iowa returns everyone from the team that won the Big Ten’s regular-season and conference tournament championships before being upset by Creighton in the second round of the NCAA tournament.

“I know what we’re capable of and especially with the way our season ended last year I was so grateful that I had another year and that wasn’t going to be my last taste with Iowa women’s basketball” said Czinano whose younger sister Maggie is a guard with the Gophers’ team.

The Hawkeyes were not one of the Big Ten’s four Sweet 16 teams last season but the Big Ten’s 14 coaches and a select media panel picked Iowa as the favorite to win the conference this season ahead of Indiana Ohio State and Nebraska.

“I think we deserve that ranking but it’s a long season; there’s highs there’s lows” said Iowa point guard Caitlin Clark who led the nation in scoring (27 points per game) and assists (8.0) last season and was the preseason pick for player of the year.

“It’s the way you bounce back” Clark said. “It’s the way you respond. Like Coach (Lisa) Bluder said pressure is a privilege.”

STILL LEARNING

Clark recently signed a Name Image Likeness (NIL) deal with Nike and already had one with Topps trading cards. “Obviously there aren’t many rules out there” she said. “This is so new and people are still learning — I’m still learning.”

NIL deals have been permitted since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2021 that schools couldn’t limit education-related payments to student-athletes. So the landscape is pretty new. Clark said she leans mostly on her family when making those decisions.

“No one knows everything” Clark said. “They might think they do but they’re not experts in the industry. No one is.”

A NEW COURSE?

In July 100 Big Ten student-athletes joined Warren and other conference leaders for an immersive civil rights experience in Selma and Montgomery Ala. where the late Dr. Martin Luther King led a five-day march to the state capital to bring attention to voting rights.

It was the first of what the Big Ten is calling “Big Life Experience” trips and Warren said the conference is working on making those trips credit-earning courses at member institutions.

“Regardless of what course a student-athlete has taken in civil rights that trip right there I can tell you right now was life-changing” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvdXMtYmFua3Mtc2Vlbi1idWlsZGluZy01LWJsbi1yZXNlcnZlcy1yZWNlc3Npb24tcmlza3MtZ3Jvdy0yMDIyLTEwLTExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. banks likely set aside $5 bln in Q3 reserves as recession risks grow,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvdXMtYmFua3Mtc2Vlbi1idWlsZGluZy01LWJsbi1yZXNlcnZlcy1yZWNlc3Npb24tcmlza3MtZ3Jvdy0yMDIyLTEwLTExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2RkZWQ3MWE2LTI2MzctNDVlYy1iOGI1LWRhMDE1NDQ1NWM4YtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US banks to set aside $4bn for potential losses from bad loans,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The rule would make it more difficult for companies to classify their workers as independent contractors leading to significant cost increases as those companies are forced to pay for things like minimum wage overtime payroll taxes unemployment insurance workers’ compensation and sick days.

That particularly affects gig economy leaders like Uber and Lyft which save up to 20% to 30% on labor costs by classifying their workers as independent contractors according to some estimates. Shares of Uber Lyft and Doordash all dropped over 10% after news of the Biden administration’s proposal broke on Tuesday morning but the stocks have since recovered some of their losses.

Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a Tuesday research note that the proposed gig worker rule change could put companies that rely on the savings they get from employing independent contractors into a difficult situation.

“While there is a lot of uncertainty around how the Federal government and States will handle this latest proposal it’s a clear blow to the gig economy and a near-term concern for the likes of Uber and Lyft” Ives wrote. “With ride-sharing and other gig economy players depending on the contractor business model a classification to employees would essentially throw the business model upside down and cause some major structural changes if this holds.”

The end of an Uber era?

The Labor Department’s proposal amounts to a reworking of the “test” that determines whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee that was developed under the Trump administration.

The new test will now be based on things like job responsibilities a company’s control over workers’ hours workers’ opportunity for profit or loss the permanency of jobs and a handful of other factors.

“This remains a fluid situation but the initial knee-jerk reaction is clearly negative with more questions than answers around this latest proposal in the eyes of the Street” Ives wrote.

Uber and Lyft were quick to comment on the Labor Department’s new proposal on Tuesday portraying it as a return to the policies of the Obama administration.

In a blog post Lyft said that the rule doesn’t reclassify its drivers as employees and won’t force a change to its business model as of now.

“This is just the first step in what is likely to be a longer process before any final rule or determination is made” the company wrote noting that there is a 45-day period for public comments on the rule change before it is adopted.

Lyft added that it was expecting this new rule when the Biden administration came to power and said that it only represents a return to the “approach the Obama Administration used to determine employee status.”

“This approach previously applied to Lyft and app-based companies and did not result in reclassification of drivers” Lyft wrote arguing that its workers shouldn’t be classified as employees because 95% work less than 20 hours per week and 96% are students or have other jobs.

Uber’s communications team echoed Lyft’s comments in a statement saying that the proposed rule “takes a measured approach essentially returning us to the Obama era.”

“In a time of deep economic uncertainty it’s crucial that the Biden administration continues to hear from the more than 50 million people who have found an earning opportunity with companies like ours” they added.

Some 16% of U.S. adults earned money through the gig economy in 2021 and 31% said it was their main job according to a Pew Research study.

Despite the new proposal most Americans are still supportive of independent contractor work in the gig economy. More than 60% of U.S. adults believe ride-hailing drivers should be considered independent contractors according to Pew Research published last year while just 35% believe they should be employees.

Still many advocacy groups and gig workers argue that they’re chronically underpaid bereft of benefits and have to work long hours to stay afloat financially.

“‘Flexibility’ and ‘independence’ sound nice but here’s the truth: When you have to work over 50 hours a week to make ends meet when you have to weigh every hour that you don’t work against the lost income when you are one accident or illness away from financial ruin flexibility and independence mean nothing” Mike Robinson who has been a full-time Lyft driver since 2017 wrote in a recent Fortune op-ed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1LmVkdS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyL3doYXQteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC11YmVyLWRhdGEtYnJlYWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Users: What You Need to Know about Last Month's Data Breach,"Uber Users: What You Need to Know about Last Month’s Data Breach MET cybercrime expert on how hacker likely gained access to company data and systems

Educating employees is crucial to prevent hacks BU cybersecurity expert says. File photo by Jeff Chiu/AP Photo Cybersecurity Uber Users: What You Need to Know about Last Month’s Data Breach MET cybercrime expert on how hacker likely gained access to company data and systems

Last month the internal databases of American multinational ride-share company Uber were hacked. The unnamed 18-year-old who claimed responsibility for the hack said Uber’s ineffective security measures made the breach possible. The hacker who was eventually arrested and is in police custody is said to have gained access to Uber’s secure data through “social engineering” which means manipulating or deceiving someone often with email or phone calls to gain access to personal or financial information. These manipulation methods are becoming commonplace in the world of cybercrime. By posing as a corporate information technology worker the hacker claimed to have convinced an Uber contractor to reveal the password to Uber’s systems. Uber says it is also possible the hacker bought the corporate password on the dark web.

According to Uber having obtained the contractor’s password the hacker sent repeated log-in requests to the contractor’s account and was then able to bypass Uber’s two-factor log-in authentication—a system where a user is granted access after electronically confirming their identity twice—when the contractor finally accepted the authentication. The hacker was also admitted to the Uber Slack account and posted a message that read: “I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach.”

A security update from Uber says they believe the cybercrime group Lapsus$ is responsible for the attack. “We’re working with several leading digital forensics firms as part of the investigation” Uber writes. “We will also take this opportunity to continue to strengthen our policies practices and technology to further protect Uber against future attacks.”

BU Today spoke with Kyung-shick Choi (MET’02) a Metropolitan College professor of the practice and director of its Cybercrime Investigation & Cybersecurity programs about the implications of the hack and how companies and users can protect themselves.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q & A with Kyung-shick Choi BU Today: Can you briefly describe the scope of Uber’s security breach? Choi: Uber’s security breach is quite an interesting case because unlike other major breaches I wonder if the hacker attained what they really wanted to attain. I was expecting some sort of ransomware attack so they could seek financial gain. But this time it looks like they didn’t really get much. Of course maybe Uber’s cybersecurity quickly responded to the incident but they clearly stated they hacked right on the Slack. And so to me that’s much more what the motivation could be.



They already identified the potential suspect Lapsus$. It’s a Brazilian hacker group—I presume a group of teenagers. We call them “cyber punks.” They have been really active recently and are gaining fame. I think maybe that’s why they were aiming at such a huge company. BU Today: Can you talk about their methods how they possibly gained access? Choi: According to Uber the hacker group purchased the log-in password from the dark web. It’s very common that hackers are trading selling and buying older password and log-in names. So consider if they are cyber punks and not extremely skillful just getting the credential through the dark web is the easiest way to commit crime rather than a complicated hacking process. So maybe that’s what’s happening in this case.



Now Uber has a two-factor authentication system and so that’s double protection. With two-factor authentication you get that notification and you have to press the buttons. So maybe [an Uber worker] thought okay I did it and so they approve. So that’s one way and that’s pure luck to be honest if [the hackers] did it that way.



Another way if they’re really dedicated hackers [is to] get deeper into the system. And then they [would] escalate the privilege and change the information to switch the contact to their own. It has to be a burner phone so that you can get your own authentication using the burner. That’s what pretty skillful hackers do but it looks like the [Uber hackers were] not at that level. That’s my assumption. But normally cyber punks try and try and try and can kind of luckily get in. BU Today: What are the potential ramifications for users and their data as a result of the hack? Choi: Personal data is so important. Every single person’s data can be weaponized and used against them. Your data can be used for criminal purposes for account takeover or financial gain. And then of course [hackers] can sell the information. And that’s why privacy is so important in that we really have to protect ourselves.



I can expand it to sexual crime. And so if hackers find out the date of birth location and all of that they can stalk people and then even commit sextortion. I’ve seen those cases a lot.



People think oh this is just one hack. But it’s not just one hack. The damage could be substantial to individuals families and the community at large. That’s why we have to be really cautious.

BU Today: What data is believed to be compromised by the attack? Hackers downloaded the financial information from Slack. The financial information could be anything. It could be invoices or employment information. So I think [Uber and the authorities] are currently investigating that and what types of information were compromised. According to them nonsensitive data was exposed but we don’t know until we really see what happened. Credit card information is encrypted and so that information is safe and other travel information is secure.



I think right after the incident [Uber] reported it to law enforcement and now the FBI is involved. I think [Uber] did the right thing so once the FBI gets involved and they do a very extensive investigation we will receive much more accurate information. BU Today: Do you think Uber handled the situation well? I didn’t see the evidence. If I investigated it then maybe I could see the log file and when they really got hacked. In most hacking incidents especially on a big scale the corporations don’t report the victimization right away. I hope Uber reported it right away. At least the suspect and the hacking group left a message but we don’t know when they really started. And so maybe they spent extensive time maybe a month of time until they got to that stage.



Commonly major cases are similar in that way because [hacked companies] don’t want to ruin their reputation from the corporate side. They don’t want to give bad images to the public. Who’s going to use Uber if they constantly get hacked?



In this case [Uber] saw the sign of the hack and they reported it to law enforcement. I think that’s the right way to do it. And that’s why maybe the damages according to Uber are minimal. Although we don’t know yet. BU Today: Are other rideshare apps vulnerable to similar attacks? Of course. Because of the tendency of hackers if they are professional hackers they will never attack headquarters because headquarters have a lot of security built right there. All the major hacks if you really examine them are not really happening by directly hacking into the main server. [Hackers] are always finding the small vendors. The size of the company could be very small. That’s a vulnerability right there. That’s also how you handle digital information and that’s very important.



But definitely Lyft and all the others should be careful. So that means they need to educate their employees. BU Today: What steps should Uber and other rideshare apps take to prevent similar attacks in the future? I have my own theory and my theory has become dominant in computer crime victimization. It’s called “cyber-routine activities theory.” Very simple. There are two factors that contribute to computer crime victimization. So either online behavior that means a human error and/or there’s a security issue. Business emails getting compromised is always the number one computer crime victimization throughout the history of the internet or email.



Then another factor is cybersecurity. What if you don’t have basic protection? What if you don’t have the internal security management? Meaning do you have a strong policy in place in your company? If something happens incident response is so important. If you don’t have an incident response policy…they have everything. You just have to wait for law enforcement and watch the hackers stealing every single thing. You cannot do anything because you don’t know what to do.



Also important is educating employees. It’s critical.



Many [hacking] cases I would say close to 50 percent come from an insider. So that’s why you have to maintain all the security credentials especially when [employees] leave the company. Revenge is a huge factor. [If] they’re not just leaving nicely…[if] they’re doing something with it maybe selling the information or sharing all the credentials or selling it to the dark web. BU Today: It’s believed the hacker potentially gained access to Uber’s internal systems through a psychological manipulation tactic referred to as social engineering. How can Uber and other companies better prepare and train their employees to identify these persuasive techniques? The effective training has to be hands-on training. So statistically speaking hands-on training really boosts your long-term memory. This type of training is essential so that you feel it when you click it and see what happens. Our programs at MET are designed to train our future law enforcement in cybercrime investigation and cybersecurity. We’re creating a scenario. So we have a suspect and a victim. Students really feel it. They are investigating the case and see how [the hacker] sends a phishing email and they really observe.



Also technology quickly evolves almost everyday. And then our online behavior quickly adapts. The companies should think about that and the changing technology. Companies should really know their employee populations and the characteristics for using social media for example. BU Today: How can users protect themselves and their personal data when using rideshare apps? Anytime you hear an incident has happened the first thing you have to do is change your passwords. If you see anything happen like a hacking incident from the company side I highly recommend changing passwords so [hackers] cannot do anything further.



And so of course never use the password you have used before. If I were an Uber customer I would have a very strong password. And be careful when you download apps by making sure you are downloading genuine apps because there are lots of replicated ones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzExL3R3by13b21lbi1raWxsZWQtdWJlci1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaS05My1ib3N0b24tdG93LXRydWNrLXVydXNoaS1tYWRhbmktZGVsYW5pZS1mZWtlcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What we know about the 2 women killed in an Uber crash on I-93 in Boston,"Local News What we know about the 2 women killed in an Uber crash on I-93 in Boston The two women just graduated with physical therapy degrees from Quinnipiac University.

The two women killed in a car crash in Boston Saturday when a tow truck rear-ended their Uber were 2021 graduates of Quinnipiac University’s physical therapy program the department wrote on Facebook Tuesday.

Urushi Madani 25 of North Andover and Delanie Fekert 25 of Floral Park New York were pronounced dead on scene after the 10 p.m. crash near the Zakim Bridge.

Their driver survived with serious injuries. The tow truck driver as well as the driver of a Honda Civic that crashed into the tow truck were unharmed.

Tracy Wall the program director of Quinnipiac’s Physical Therapy Department told The Boston Globe Tuesday that Madani and Fekert were both dedicated students who worked in outpatient physical therapy. They had just earned their doctorates in physical therapy degrees from the Connecticut university she said.

“Their smiles were contagious and will continue to shine bright for all who knew them” the department wrote on Facebook.

Ken Kosior chair of Quinnipiac University’s department of physical therapy told The Connecticut Post that during their program Madani and Fekert were “inseparable.”

“They were always looking toward what was ahead and…always asking the right questions and being present. Both very intelligent and bright young women with a huge future ahead of them” he told the newspaper.

Wall told the Globe that both women deeply valued “being able to help people improve their quality of life.”

She said the group of 66 students the pair had graduated with had already lost a classmate in a tragic accident last year.

Madani’s older brother Shaunak Madani told the Globe Tuesday that his sister was “fearless spirited extremely funny and very compassionate.”

On Facebook many friends of the two women mourned their loss.

Anthony Paul a friend of Fekert’s wrote a post in her honor saying “Delanie you were one of the sweetest individuals I have ever met. I’m honored and truly thankful I had the opportunity of knowing you and getting to work alongside you.”

Our Lady of Victory Parish a Catholic church in Floral Park to which Fekert and her family belonged held a Monday night Rosary for the family.

Donny Golden Irish Dance School wrote on Facebook Sunday that Fekert had been a student of the school and an accomplished Irish dancer.

“Delanie will always be remembered for her radiant smile her kindness positivity laughter grace and elegance. Her beauty shone from the inside out” the school wrote.

“In the Golden school she was cherished like a sister by so many dancers loved like a daughter by the moms and admired by all in her extended dance family.”

Bridget Spillane who knew Fekert through the school also posted a tribute to her on Facebook on Monday.

“Delanie Fekert was a bright light in this world…and not only because of her megawatt smile. She was a sweet and kind soul who was dedicated wholly to everything and everyone” she wrote.

“I will miss watching her dance in our shows…she was so beautiful to watch – and she was a dancer I could always rely on.”

Jillian Milch a friend of Madani’s who said she met her when they were paired as roommates at Quinnipiac wrote a heartfelt tribute to her on Facebook Monday.

“We used to recite the Billy Madison script from opening to end credits sing anything from High School Musical at the top of our lungs we danced to elevator music and we bickered like sisters do. The love you brought into my life is truly immeasurable” she wrote.

ULTA,Ulta Beauty,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvaG93LXNwZWNpYWx0eS1iZWF1dHktcmV0YWlsLWNhbWUtdG8tZG9taW5hdGUtdGhlLW1hc3MtY2hhbm5lbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How specialty beauty retail came to dominate the mass channel,"Shopping for beauty is not like it used to be and you have specialty retailers dedicated exclusively to beauty to thank for that.

The change to beauty retail has occurred over three decades since Sephora and Ulta Beauty first emerged in the 1990s and disrupted the department store dynamic. But over time specialty retail’s influence has crept into other shopping spheres like e-commerce and mass retail. A key motivator for this creep is the chicken-and-egg dynamic of where and how customers shop and how specialty retail has influenced and responded to it.

Take for example Lumene a Nordic mass skin-care brand that sells through CVS and Target. Johanna Paavilainen gm of North America for Lumene said she is tasked with expanding the brand’s distribution beyond the aforementioned stores to new specialty retailers to align the North American market with Lumene’s international masstige positioning and “be where the customer is.” She is targeting online specialty retailers while also considering one or two brick-and-mortar retailers.

Being available where the customer is has become a key talking point within the beauty industry on par with the phrase “surprise and delight” and building communities. These terms have a tendency to get tossed around to the point of cliché and people cease to question what they actually mean let alone how they work. In the case of being where the customer is increased fragmentation of product assortments based on use cases clean positioning and diversity for example has necessitated that retailers offer dedicated spaces on shelves devoted to these types of products. The result is that mass beauty retail as we know it is fading and being reborn.

Kohl’s JCPenney Walmart and Target have all opted for retail partnerships with specialty retailers like Sephora Thirteen Lune SpaceNK and Ulta Beauty respectively to build out their shop-in-shops or expanded endcaps in the case of Walmart. CVS opted to build out its own specialty counters dedicated to prestige beauty without a retail partner with the most recent version launching in August called Skin Care Center. It is an elevated shop-in-shop concept with fewer brands and more shelf space. CVS previously launched an experiential concept called BeautyIRL which partnered with Glamsquad in 2018 to offer express beauty services; that partnership is currently in 160 stores. Andrea Harrison vp of beauty and personal care at CVS said BeautyIRL led to attracting a younger demographic bigger basket size and more frequent trips to stores.

Paavilainen said that Lumene customers are bucketed into three segments. There are people who are looking for accessibly-priced products those who want clean products and those seeking products providing a glow. Clean beauty is especially responsible for the retail fragmentation and emphasis on specialized retail. Clean beauty retailers like The Detox Market Follain and Credo Beauty have emerged to cater to the category while Sephora Ulta Beauty and Bluemercury have debuted clean beauty standards and special in-store merchandising programs for clean brands. Ulta Beauty even partnered with clean beauty retailer Follain in Feb. 2020 underscoring just how specialized clean beauty is.

“It’s all about the changes in consumer purchasing behaviors and Lumene needs to go where these consumers prefer to shop” said Paavilainen. “Big box [retailers] definitely play a role in visibility and credibility whereas specialty stores and online markets meet the immediate and specific needs of consumers.”

But as the blurring between luxury prestige and mass beauty brands has increased it’s led to a question of why mass retailers need the aid of specialty retailers.

“These segmentation schemes between department stores and mass merchandisers have been so strong for so long that [a retailer like] Target could have [had] problems with credibility. People don’t necessarily trust them to be makeup experts” said Barbara Kahn professor of marketing at Wharton School of Business.

So far these partnerships have proven successful. In its second-quarter earnings call in August Brian Cornell CEO of Target said Ulta Beauty’s shop-in-shops drove “incremental traffic and sales” and that Target was responding by trying to rapidly expand the program to additional doors. Target has a goal of operating 800 locations by end of 2022. Beauty sales overall at Target grew by high single digits year-over-year in the second quarter. Sephora which has nearly 600 shop-in-shops in Kohl’s will expand to another 850 locations in 2023. This partnership is delivering a “high single-digit sales lift” compared to Kohl’s doors without Sephora according to Michelle Gass CEO of Kohl’s during the company’s second-quarter earnings in August. Additionally Kohl’s has acquired more than 1 million new customers since the partnership began in Aug. 2021. They’re younger and more diverse and shop more frequently than Kohl’s average customer.

Another dimension to being where the customer is literally refers to where they live. This explains the appeal for specialty retailers and their prestige brand partners to delve into the mass space. Laurie Tessier merchandising director of prestige beauty at Walmart explained that it is not always convenient for many Walmart customers to access prestige brands in the brick-and-mortar space. Retailers like Bluemercury and Sephora have traditionally been centered in urban high-foot-traffic areas as opposed to rural places and small towns. Yet most customers buy across prestige and mass. With over 10000 stores 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store according to the company. The Walmart and SpaceNK partnership called Beautyspace began in March initially in 250 doors.

“We were looking to provide our customers with access and convenience” said Tessier. “What we’ve done now is create a one-stop shop for them within Walmart’s existing infrastructure.”

Beautyscape’s special endcaps feature a variety of prestige brands like Mario Badescu and Lancer spanning body care hair care skin care and makeup. This differs from the usual aisle demarcation based on categories. Endcap resets are likely to be more frequent than the traditional beauty aisles said Tessier adding that prestige brands have a great opportunity to showcase holiday gift sets in this environment.

“This became more about giving brands a special place within the Walmart aisle that felt different from the [rest of] the department” said Tessier.

Convenience was also a factor for CVS with its Skin Care Centers especially for more novice beauty enthusiasts. Skin Care Center is more about expertise and curation than BeautyIRL which was based on creating a more enjoyable beauty shopping experience via services and indie brands. There are fewer brands and products on shelves and each center is staffed with an aesthetician to help shoppers analyze their skin with a Skinscope diagnostic tool.

“Every customer experience influences their expectations” said Harrison. “Customers are now looking for certain brands and experiences and they’re looking for a [higher] level of service. As the retailers around us offer those things we must be conscious of offering an environment in which someone wants to shop.”

Lumene is not part of CVS’s latest Skin Care Centers which are only in three stores nationwide but it is part of CVS’s Healthy Skin Care concept. Healthy Skin Care units spotlight better-for-you products in over 2000 CVS stores nationwide and Lumene is at a majority of those. She said Lumene has doubled its per-store sales over the past two years due to its better positioning on CVS shelves. Sitting next to similarly priced prestige household names like La Roche-Posay and Dermalogica helps draw more attention on the shelf. More spacing on better-looking shelves also helps Lumene stand out and communicate more.

“This has been helpful and matches what I [am trying to do] with repositioning the brand away from being a pure drugstore brand. What CVS started doing is wonderful [because] they recognize the same [specialty] need for brands” said Paavilainen.

The success of CVS’s Skin Care Center endeavor is based on customer feedback and brand sales increases. Where and when it will expand is yet to be determined but even a small trial can inform CVS’s overall beauty strategy moving forward said Harrison. As fragmentation in beauty categories continues mass brands will take a page out of specialty retail further eliminating the mass retail’s one-size-fits-all approach as it has stood. For example Harrison said there is also a greater opportunity for assortments for melanated skin. Diversity and inclusivity are primed to be another rich area for specialty retail with several retailers exploring how to address the needs of these customers. JCPenney notably partnered with Thirteen Lune an e-tailer focused on Black- and Brown-owned brands. Ulta Beauty Sephora Credo and Bluemercury have all signed the 15 Percent Pledge and featured BIPOC voices and beauty perspectives in various campaigns.

“People especially the younger generation are really demanding that brands speak to DE&I” said Kahn. “That’s an important trend in beauty. And we will see more and more of that in retail.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdsYW0uY29tLzEwNDg3NDUvdWx0YS1iZWF1dHktc3RydWdnbGluZy1pbi1zdG9yZS1mb290LXRyYWZmaWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ulta Beauty Is Struggling With In-Store Foot Traffic Compared To This Time Last Year,"As seen in data collected by SafeGraph Ulta Beauty hasn't been getting as many in-store visits during the summer and fall of 2022 as the retailer did at this time in 2021. For instance Ulta pulled in 34144 in-store shoppers during a single day in September 2022 — almost 10000 fewer customers than the company received in October 2021. Believe it or not Ulta isn't the only well-known makeup and skincare-focused retailer having this problem. Sephora's in-store foot traffic dropped to half that of this time last year. What's more Sally Beauty Supply is struggling to reach last year's foot traffic levels so this lack of foot traffic is an industry-wide issue.

The lack of people showing up to Ulta and other cosmetic retailers isn't as random as you might think. Do you remember the late spring and early summer of 2021 when COVID-19 vaccines became available to the public meaning that life began to feel normal? As a result of fewer mask requirements and more nightlife venues and restaurants re-opening with pre-pandemic hours there was an intense sense of urgency to get dressed up buy and wear new makeup and go out. However many people have been vaccinated for a while now and have been living their lives again for quite some time so that sense of urgency to go out and do makeup isn't as prominent as it was a year ago. Plus inflation has been hitting every sector of the U.S. meaning consumers have less money to spend on makeup because more of their dollars are going toward food bills and gas the latter of which has also seen higher prices.

In an analysis of the results researchers at Launchmetrics said online and Instagram were the two main channels from which ranked brands accumulated the most MIV and noted that beauty retailers received “significant MIV through video format channels such as YouTube and TikTok due to their brands being promoted in makeup and skin care tutorials.”

Regarding the performance of Sephora Launchmetrics said owned media played a key role. The researchers said the “top performing voice for the brand comes from owned media channels and with having many region-specific accounts Sephora was able to generate $82.8 million in MIV across owned social media during July to September.”

The top-performing “partner voice” for Sephora was Rare Beauty which garnered Sephora $6.5 million in MIV. “That being said the top performing celebrity voice for the brand was Selena Gomez whose social brand mentions in reference to Rare Beauty earned the brand $2.9 million in MIV across eight placements ($1.6 million of which was garnered through Selena’s YouTube channel)” Launchmetrics said in the report.

Sephora’s partnership with HausLabs also drove significant MIV for the period. “The second top-performing celebrity voice was Lady Gaga whose brand mentions in reference to HausLabs generated $2.5 million in MIV across 18 placements” Launchmetrics said. “The top placement mentioning the brand garnered Sephora $394000 in MIV. Additionally the mentions by HausLabs generated $1.3 million in MIV.”

For Ulta Beauty Launchmetrics said the “second top performing voice for the brand originates from partner placements garnering Ulta Beauty $43 million in MIV. Urban Decay ranked as the top partner voice generating $5.1 million in MIV.”

The locomotives will be built at Union Pacific’s North Little Rock facility in Arkansas with the first prototype expected to be delivered in late 2023. Five additional units will then arrive in 2024.

The locomotives will be able to operate in single-engine battery-charging or electric-only modes. In addition their batteries will be compatible with both wayside and onboard charging.

Union Pacific’s Senior Vice President of Engineering and Mechanical Shane Keller said: “Adding hybrid-electric locomotives to our fleet is another important step for Union Pacific as we work to explore ‘drop-in’ technologies that modify current systems and reduce our carbon footprint. This pilot will help make our fleet more fuel efficient and further advance our commitment to reaching our sustainability goals while testing the technology’s capability for expanded use across our locomotive fleet.”

The new locomotives will be produced as mother-slug sets where two locomotives are replaced with one diesel locomotive connected to an accessory or slug. The engineless slug will increase the traction motors available to the locomotive to boost its pulling and braking power for yard operations.

The slug unit will be equipped with batteries power electronics and controls supplied by ZTR. This will allow the hybrid-electric mother-slug to operate in single engine battery charging or electric-only modes.

ZTR Control Systems President Derek Shipley said: “ZTR is proud of our long-standing relationship with Union Pacific and excited to partner with them on this hybrid-electric locomotive development. This investment aligns well with our ongoing goal to leverage ZTR’s technical expertise to support railways in their decarbonisation and efficiency improvement efforts. This initial hybrid-electric mother-slug application will be the basis of our design for future hybrid-electric long-haul and fully electric solutions.”

Earlier this year Union Pacific also announced an agreement with Wabtec Corporation to modernise 600 locomotives. These improvements will increase fuel efficiency by up to 18 percent in order to further reduce the company’s emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVub21haGEuZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMC91bm8tdG8tY2VsZWJyYXRlLWludGVybnMtdGhyb3VnaC1jYXJlZXItY29ubmVjdC1ldmVudC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omaha Area Employers Join Mavericks to Celebrate Career Connect,,,,,,,,,,

In May Joby was granted a Part 135 air carrier certification by the Federal Aviation Administration one of three approvals required to operate as an air taxi service in cities and communities across the U.S. The company must also receive a type certification on its aircraft and production certification on its production facilities.

Joby reported a net loss of $46.6 million during the second quarter of 2022 including total operating expenses of $99.4 million reflecting continued progress in certifying its aircraft and early manufacturing operations. As of the end of the second quarter the company had $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments to support operations.

Delta is not the only company to invest in eVTOL aircraft.

Last month United Airlines announced a $15 million investment in Embraer-backed startup Eve Air Mobility. The carrier agreed to buy 200 four-seat electric aircraft with options for 200 more. The first deliveries are expected as early as 2026.

In August United placed a $10 million deposit for 100 eVTOL aircraft from Archer Aviation. Last year the company agreed to order up to 200 of Archer's flying taxis. The deal is worth approximately $1 billion with an option to purchase an additional $500 million worth of aircraft. Archer is aiming to launch as early as 2024 .

Load factor is expected to rise sharply YOY to its highest level in three years.

Revenue is expected to be at its highest level in at least four years.

Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) the world's largest airline before the pandemic crippled global travel is expected to say profit quintupled in the third quarter as its load factor reached a three-year high.



Delta will probably say early on Oct. 13 that adjusted earnings per share (EPS) excluding certain items jumped to $1.43 from $0.30 in the same period a year ago according to consensus estimates provided by Visible Alpha. It would be the fourth profit in five quarters after a string of losses as revenue rises 54% to $14.1 billion and its load factor a key metric used by airlines to gauge what percentage of seats are filled by paid passengers increases to 87.7%.



The results are likely to underscore the global industry's recovery from COVID-19 pandemic as travel restrictions ease according to the International Air Transport Association. Air carriers lost $137.7 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2021.



Granted Delta and its rivals still face challenges including accelerating inflation that's pushed up ticket prices and threaten to curb demand for travel. Higher fuel prices meantime add to Delta's costs. Its shares are down 33% in the past year on a total return basis compared with a 17% decline in the S&P 500.

Delta Air Lines Earnings History

Delta posted adjusted EPS of $2.32 in Q3 FY 2019 before reporting six consecutive quarterly losses beginning in Q1 FY 2020 including a loss of $3.30 in Q3 FY 2020. It returned to profit in 3Q 2021.

Revenue started to rebound after declining for five quarters through Q1 FY 2021. It almost doubled to $13.8 billion in Q2 2022 surpassing pre-pandemic levels. For Q3 analysts expect an even stronger performance estimating the highest revenue in four years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzExLzIzMzk2ODUxL2RlbHRhLWpvYnktaW52ZXN0LWV2dG9sLWhvbWUtdG8tYWlycG9ydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Airlines will invest up to $200 million in Joby Aviation to create a 'home-to-airport' air taxi service,"Delta Airlines will invest $60 million in Joby Aviation a leading electric air taxi startup to create a “home-to-airport” service using the startup’s five-seat electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft the companies announced Tuesday. Delta said its investment in Joby could go as high as $200 million if the company hits certain milestones.

The service which will launch first in New York City and Los Angeles with other cities to follow will be “mutually exclusive” across the US and UK for five years with the option to extend that exclusivity for longer the companies said. The home-to-airport service will exist in parallel to Joby’s currently nonexistent airport service transporting passengers from cities to airports.

A 50 minute trip from Manhattan to JFK could take just 10 minutes

In a briefing with reporters Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt said that a trip from Manhattan to JFK Airport which can take as long as 50 minutes to an hour when traveling by car or subway would take as little as 10 minutes when flying in one of the company’s five-passenger aircraft — “along with a really spectacular view” he added. It’s a nice thought but the truth of the matter is that the type of aircraft that Joby is developing — electric low noise profile cross between helicopter and drone — is not yet approved for any commercial service anywhere in the world.

Neither Delta nor Joby would disclose when they intend to launch the service noting the lengthy regulatory process that Joby’s unique aircraft still needs to undergo. They also didn’t reveal how the service would be priced although Bevirt said he wanted fares to be “accessible.” Joby has said it intends to launch its first commercial service in 2024.

Delta is the latest major airline to bet on unconventional aircraft technology in the expectation that city skies will soon be teeming with small egg-shaped vehicles with fixed wings and tilt rotors that run on battery power. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said his company’s investment was distinct from other similar funding announcements because the airline wasn’t seeking to purchase Joby’s aircraft or operate the service itself.

“We’re not looking to be an operator; we’re going to be working with Joby”

“We’re not looking to be an operator; we’re going to be working with Joby who’s going to be our operator” Bastian said during a briefing with reporters. “And so all of our attention and focus is really on delivering a great customer experience and providing the airport infrastructure.”

As previously noted electric air taxis aren’t a real thing yet. They face a host of technical and regulatory challenges before they can scale up into a meaningful service. So far those projects have proven costly to implement requiring the construction of a vast network of rooftop or ground-level “vertiports” and regulatory approval from a host of federal state and local agencies.

Joby Aviation which was founded in 2009 has been attacking this problem for quite some time and it has a lot of financial support including investments from Toyota and Uber. The company went public in February 2021 after merging with a “blank check” special acquisition company or SPAC. The company got $1.6 billion as part of the deal but has struggled to win new investments until now. Joby’s stock is currently selling for around $3.80-a-share.

Asked what milestones Joby would need to hit in order to unlock the full $200 million investment Bastian didn’t provide a clear answer. The company has made some notable regulatory progress in recent months. Earlier this year Joby was awarded with a Part 135 Air Carrier Certification by the Federal Aviation Administration which the company need to operate an on-demand air taxi service. It still needs two more certifications alongside type certification and production certification before its aircraft can legally carry passengers.

Joby’s stock is currently selling for around $3.80-a-share

Noise could be a problem for Delta and Joby. The eVTOL startup claims its aircraft are far less noisy than internal-combustion engine vehicles like helicopters which allow them to operate within residential communities without subjecting people to brutal levels of noise pollution. The company conducted several tests with NASA recently that found its aircraft producing a level of noise while flying overhead similar to the hum of a refrigerator. Joby said most people would barely notice it.

Volume production will be another challenge for Joby. The company presented a bullish view of its production plans in it investor deck when it went public but a recent short seller report noted that it filed plans to build a much smaller facility with regulators. The short seller said Joby is overstating how many aircraft it plans to eventually produce. Bevirt noted that Joby has yet to select a location for its Phase One facility but it is currently in conversations with a number of different possible facilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzExL2RlbHRhLWludmVzdHMtaW4tZmx5aW5nLXRheGlzLXRvLW9mZmVyLXJpZGVzLXRvLXRoZS1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta invests in flying taxis to offer rides to the airport,"It’s a bird it’s a plane it’s a flying taxi!

Delta Air Lines has invested $60 million in Joby Aviation with plans to offer flying taxi services to airports in New York City and Los Angeles.

Joby Aviation has been backed by Uber and the Pentagon and just went public last year.

“I’m optimistic that there are better ways and certainly more sustainable ways to get to the airport than sitting in one to two hour traffic jams on the way to JFK or LaGuardia or LAX” Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said.

Delta announced that their initial investment could grow to $200 million if the project proves to continue on the projected deadline.

United Airlines Holdings and American Airlines Groups have also invested in similar projects with both airlines buying their own fleet of flying taxis.

Delta Air Lines plans to offer the flying taxi service as an add-on option available for purchase on their website or app. REUTERS

Delta instead plans to outsource Joby’s services and offer the transportation option as an add-on to ticket purchases that can be ordered through the Delta website or app. The service will be a part of Delta’s premium offerings but plans to keep the pricing unrestrictive.

The companies have not yet announced a launch date for this new service but Joby has previously announced plans to offer commercial services by 2024.

These flying taxis are not currently permitted to carry paying passengers in the US but similar programs such as BLADE airport rides which currently offers $195 helicopter rides to and from New York City commercial and private airports.

Several airlines have invested in flying taxis as a more sustainable and faster way to travel to and from the airports in major cities. Stephen Yang

Air-taxi manufacturers have reportedly raised more than $7 billion in the last two years according to the Wall Street Journal as travel companies have continued to explore new technologies.

In 2018 Uber announced their hopes to offer flying taxis by 2020. After missing their goal the company sold their aviation division Uber Elevate to Joby who continues to dominate the space.

The option to call a flying taxi to JFK or LaGuardia doesn’t seem like its going to be offered any time too soon but could become a more needed solution as taxis become increasingly scarce and Uber prices continue to skyrocket."

Software as a service (SaaS) has been steadily gaining ground over the past couple of years and now UPS is aiming to tap into new revenue streams by combining its standalone digital offerings into a ‘logistics as a service’ (LaaS) package.

The move brings together the integrator’s 3PL arm Coyote Logistics same-day delivery provider Roadie the Delivery Solutions platform and financial services provider UPS Capital.

In addition UPS will bring in its partnership with CommerceHub aimed at building delivery density.

CEO Carol Tomé revealed the plan in an earnings call announcing the integrator’s third-quarter results in late October.

She described it as “a key plank” in the company’s strategic shift from the “better not bigger” approach of the past year to “better and bolder”.

Ms Tomé said: “Bolder is about moving faster to grow in our targeted market segment. It’s also about combining digital solutions with our global integrated network to create more value for our customers and new revenue opportunities.”

The UPS LaaS concept is being built around five strategic pillars: delivery density; end-to-end visibility; financial solutions; robust reverse logistics; and advanced capabilities that help clients optimise their supply chain.

“When we combine logistics-as-a-service with our integrated physical network we believe we will be unstoppable” added Ms Tomé.

UPS has wasted no time moving into its new venture. This quarter it is starting a pilot programme for more convenient returns with Overstock.com an internet retailer that primarily sells furniture. The programme picks up furniture returns from customers’ homes without requiring them to re-package the items and is one of several pilots for LaaS offerings UPS is launching.

“The LaaS venture is already gaining traction. This could be huge for them” said John Haber chief strategy officer of Transportation Insights adding that Roadie had garnered UPS a lot of customers for same-day delivery solutions.

He added that one benefit of the digital solutions is that they generated new business without having to deploy sales staff.

Primarily the LaaS venture is targeting small and mid-sized businesses which offer higher profit margins than large shippers he said.

Ms Tomé added: “It’s one of the segments where we see significant growth now making up nearly 30 % of our business. We will continue to lean into that customer segment which is actually growing.”

Brian Glick CEO of Chain.io a cloud-based supply chain integration platform agrees the LaaS strategy hits an opening in the market.

“What Carol [Tomé] described is well aligned with what SMBs need which is a company that makes it all work without having to have internal logistics staff to direct the service providers. It appears to bring the promise of 4PL to the masses in a similar way to what Flexport promises on the international side” he said.

“This announcement focuses on the distribution side of the supply chain and it will be interesting to see if UPS SCS brings a similar model to bear for the sourcing side. If they can combine the two and help SMBs manage the whole supply chain from sourcing through delivery then they’ll have something we’ve all been chasing for decades which is a turnkey supply chain function as a service” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZlZGV4cy1yZWR1Y2VkLWhvbGlkYXktZm9yZWNhc3Qtbm8tc3VycHJpc2Utc2tlcHRpY2FsLWNvbnRyYWN0b3JzLTIwMjItMTAtMTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Focus: FedEx's reduced holiday forecast no surprise to skeptical contractors,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/fedexs-reduced-holiday-forecast-no-surprise-skeptical-contractors-2022-10-11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZlZGV4cy1yZWR1Y2VkLWhvbGlkYXktZm9yZWNhc3Qtbm8tc3VycHJpc2Utc2tlcHRpY2FsLWNvbnRyYWN0b3JzLTIwMjItMTAtMTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV4dC8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL2FtYXpvbi10by1pbnZlc3Qtb3Zlci0xLWJpbGxpb24tdG8tYm9vc3QtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1mbGVldC1hbmQtbWljcm9tb2JpbGl0eS1odWJzLWluLdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon to invest over €1 billion to boost electric vehicle fleet and 'micromobility hubs' in Europe,"By Euronews with Reuters

To slash its carbon emissions Amazon wants to deliver more parcels using electric vans trucks cargo bikes - but also on foot.

Amazon plans to invest more than €1 billion over the next five years to roll out thousands more electric vans trucks and cargo bikes across Europe as part of efforts to slash its carbon emissions.

The online retail giant said the investment would help its electric van fleet in Europe more than triple from 3000 vehicles to more than 10000 by 2025.

Amazon also aims to double the number of cities where it has so-called “micromobility hubs” enabling parcel deliveries on cargo bikes and on foot. It currently has such hubs in 20 European cities including London.

Amazon aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040 - 10 years ahead of the target set by the Paris Agreement.

Chief Executive Andy Jassy said achieving this required “a substantial and sustained investment” with the transportation network “one of the most challenging areas” of the business to decarbonise.

The company hopes its overall investment will help boost innovation across the transportation industry and encourage more public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs).

""Deploying thousands of electric vans long-haul trucks and bikes will help us shift further away from traditional fossil fuels - and hopefully further encourage transportation and automotive industries in Europe and around the world to continue scaling and innovating"" Jassy said in a statement.

The company said that alongside EVs it will invest in thousands of chargers at facilities across Europe.

Amazon said it also hopes to purchase more than 1500 electric heavy goods vehicles - used for ""middle-mile"" shipments to package hubs - in the coming years.

Amazon's largest electric van order is for 100000 vehicles from Rivian Automotive through 2025.

Although a number of large logistics firms - including package delivery companies United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx - have committed to buying large numbers of zero-emission electric vans and trucks there are still not many available for purchase.

A number of start-ups are racing to bring electric vans or trucks to market and are facing increasing competition from legacy manufacturers like General Motors and Ford.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2N1c3RvbXMtYnJva2VyYWdlLW1hcmtldC10by1yZWFjaC11c2QtMTItODYtYmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI2LS1zb3VyY2luZy1hbmQtcHJvY3VyZW1lbnQtZm9yZWNhc3QtYW5kLWFuYWx5c2lzLXJlcG9ydC1zcGVuZGVkZ2UtMzAxNjQ0MzgwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customs Brokerage Market to reach USD 12.86 Billion by 2026 | Sourcing and Procurement Forecast and Analysis ...,"Frequently Asked Questions:

The notice stated that unless I go to a local DMV for specialty plates I'll receive a new set in the mail. It took me about 5 seconds to just roll with the random plates that are coming to me but about 2.5 seconds into thinking about it I did give thought to a custom license plate. What I didn't know is that there are at LEAST 39 phrases or words that you CAN NOT use on your license plate and for good reason.

People call them different things I grew up hearing them called the 'vanity plates' or 'specialty license plates where you pick a name or phrase to use in place of the 3 letters and 3 numbers that are traditionally on a Minnesota 'normal' license plate.

According to Minnesota Statute 168.12 ""No words or combination of letters placed on these plates may be used for commercial advertising be of an obscene indecent or immoral nature or be of a nature that would offend public morals or decency.""

The only reason I know there are at LEAST 39 illegal custom license plates is that back in 2016 Fox 9 in the Twin Cities did a story about 39 Minnesotans being told their license plates violated this statute and were being revoked. Here are the 39 license plate phrases that are illegal in Minnesota according to that article.

“WHRI will be focused on innovative interventions and medications that can make a difference in underrepresented communities including older adults rural residents women and minority populations” Walmart said in a news release Tuesday (Oct. 11).

The company argued clinical trials have long been unrepresentative of the population at large and often use participants who live near research centers and have the time and financial ability to take part. Walmart pointed to Food and Drug Administration data that shows 75% of trial participants in 2020 were white 11% were Hispanic 8% were Black and 6% were Asian.

“Walmart is focused on studies that can have a health equity impact in the communities it serves and represent all populations” the release said. “With 90% of Americans living within 10 miles of a Walmart the retailer can offer solutions to care by meeting customers and patients where they live and work.”

As PYMNTS has reported Walmart has been venturing deeper and deeper into the healthcare space as part of its rivalry with Amazon. Last month the company and UnitedHealth signed a 10-year deal to use their complementary resources and expertise to provide affordable health services.

The program is set to kick off next year with 15 Walmart Health locations in Florida and Georgia. Optum a UnitedHealth Group business will facilitate the process and help Walmart Health clinicians in using analytics and decision support tools.

And in June Walmart joined forces with patient journey automation firm GYANT in an effort to meet the demand for patients seeking virtual care.

GYANT co-founder and CEO Stefan Behrens noted at the time that “Walmart Health Virtual Care is well-positioned in telehealth care” adding that “the pandemic has shown us that more and more patients are seeking convenience in their healthcare. We share a common goal — to meet patients where they are and we are keen to kick off with like-minded innovators.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3JldGFpbC93YWxtYXJ0LWxhdW5jaGVzLXJlc2VhcmNoLWluc3RpdHV0ZS1haW1lZC1tb3JlLWRpdmVyc2UtY2xpbmljYWwtdHJpYWwtcGFydGljaXBhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart launches clinical trial-focused research institute,"Retail giant Walmart is launching a new healthcare research organization with the goal of driving higher-quality more equitable healthcare.

The Walmart Healthcare Research Institute will initially focus on driving greater equity in clinical trials for drugs that treat chronic conditions. Older adults women minorities and rural populations are often underrepresented in such trials though chronic illnesses commonly impact all of these populations. Data from the Food and Drug Administration show that in 2020 75% of trial participants were white while 11% were Hispanic 8% were Black and 6% were Asian Walmart noted in its announcement.

Walmart said it is working with a range of partners including clinical research organizations drugmakers and academic medical centers. The company said that because its reach is significant—90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store—it can use its community ties to meet more diverse potential trial populations where they are.

“At Walmart we want to help ensure all our customers have access to high quality affordable and convenient healthcare resources including innovative research” said John Wigneswaran M.D. Walmart’s chief medical officer in the release.

“We know our customers are interested in participating in healthcare research but many have not had access until now"" Wigneswaran added. ""We are already making an impact for our customers and for medical research by raising patient trust and engagement in their care.”

To make the process simple patients can connect to Walmart's MyHealthJourney app which enables them to track their own health data and insurance information in one place. Walmart said the app will notify users of care services and research opportunities they can use to better manage their own health.

Walmart said it sees the research institute as an extension of its broader focus on healthcare access and affordability. The company has also launched a low-cost private label insulin developed a $4 generic medication program and offers multiple services at cash-pay prices at its growing footprint of clinics.

“The efforts by Walmart in research are innovative and impactful—it is clear that the intention behind their foray into this space is to genuinely make a difference for patients of all ages race and gender in their ability to access research” said Bill Hawkins chairman of the board at Duke University Health in a statement. “This initiative will support individual patient health as well as the health of numerous communities home to Walmart stores.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9tYXlvLWNsaW5pYy1yZWNlaXZlcy0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1naWZ0LXRvLWV4cGFuZC1yYWRpYXRpb24tdHJlYXRtZW50LWNlbnRlci1pbi1yb2NoZXN0ZXIvNjAwMjE0NDg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayo Clinic receives $100 million gift to expand radiation treatment center in Rochester,"Mayo Clinic is receiving a $100 million gift to expand its Rochester facility for patients who need proton beam radiation treatment.

The gift from the Fred C. and Katherine B. Andersen Foundation of Bayport Minn. will allow Mayo to nearly double appointments for the treatment which delivers precise radiotherapy to cancerous tumors.

Mayo doctors use the technology in cases where tumors are near or within vital organs as well as for young people whose organs are still developing because the treatment can minimize radiation of surrounding healthy tissue.

""This gift marks a significant milestone in Mayo Clinic's decades-long relationship with Fred and Katherine Andersen and the foundation that executes on their vision for healthy strong communities"" Dr. Gianrico Farrugia the chief executive at Mayo Clinic said in a statement.

Mayo started offering the treatment in 2015 with the construction of the Jacobson Building which was named for Iowa philanthropist Richard Jacobson who also provided the clinic with a $100 million gift. The new Fred C. and Katherine B. Andersen Building will be connected to the existing center.

Mayo says its proton beam therapy program routinely approaches its appointment capacity of 1200 patients per year. The clinic anticipates treating 900 additional patients annually with the expansion thereby meeting annual estimated demand of 2000 patients by 2025.

The expansion will include two floors below ground with construction to begin next year. The goal is to start treating patients in the facility in 2026; services in the existing center will continue during construction.

""Mayo is the only center offering proton beam therapy in Minnesota and surrounding states"" the clinic said in a news release. ""The nearest centers are in Illinois and Missouri.""

Fred and Katherine Andersen who are both deceased were long-time benefactors of Mayo Clinic.

Fred was the president and chair from 1914 until 1972 of Andersen Corp. the Bayport-based manufacturer of windows and doors. Katherine served on the company's board of directors for 50 years. They created the foundation in 1959.

""This gift amplifies the quiet yet significant philanthropy the Andersens and the foundation have provided to Mayo Clinic over many years and exemplifies the Andersens' 'All Together' spirit by matching the foundation's resources with Mayo's innovative medical care"" said Peter Clements president of the Fred C. and Katherine B. Andersen Foundation.

Over the years the foundation has supported professorships at Mayo in the names of both Fred and Katherine. It has also financially supported the clinic's capital improvement women's cancer care and translational cancer research.

Through the foundation Fred and Katherine are listed among the foundation benefactors of what's now called the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine. The medical school was named for Jay Alix the founder of a corporate consulting firm who in 2018 gave Mayo its largest-ever gift of $200 million."

Data are needed to formulate new health polices and strategies to ensure quality and equity of health-care services and universal health coverage to design effective health-care interventions prioritize health challenges and mobilize resources and to monitor progress at national and subnational levels. Low- and middle-income countries often lack strong vital statistics data and health decisions are based on data from censuses surveys surveillance and administrative data sources. Studies such as the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) which quantifies health loss from hundreds of diseases injuries and risk factors are essential to complement local evidence sources and bridge evidence gaps. Ethiopia has a strong collaboration with the GBD supported by grants from development partners but this could be improved by greater collaboration and additional in-country investments.

Ethiopia established a collaboration between the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) under the Ministry of Health the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and an expert network of more than 800 GBD collaborators who jointly produce national and subnational estimates of burdens of disease. This evidence informs our health sector transformation plan and is used to revise essential health service packages develop non-communicable disease strategies assess national health expenditures and mobilize resources measure key health indicators and track progress devise strategies to narrow disparities between subnational states and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The collaboration with IHME has helped us to establish a National Data Management and Analytics Center at EPHI. The center’s multi-disciplinary team works to enhance health data repository and governance systems advance in-country health data analytics and generate quality scientific evidence and translate evidence into policy and decisions. We are establishing similar centers at subnational levels that are helping us to understand our own health data landscape in Ethiopia allowing us to identify future potential uses of health data understand technical and data infrastructure limitations and devise new strategies.

Our use of GBD data is not without challenges. Some findings have big uncertainties and may not be consistent between GBD iterations which may be owing to lack of quality data inputs or new methods being used over time. But consistency of key health indicators is essential to measure progress and track disparities between and within countries. The advanced methods used by GBD can only be understood by trained experts which requires a considerable in-country investment to understand the relevance of the findings for health policy and strategy. There are also challenges in accessing already available data which is needed to improve the estimates.

Data powers the modern economy and data-driven health policies can help to drive development and economic growth in low- and middle-income countries. This would also help to improve disease estimates such as those from GBD. A closer collaborative network between GBD and leaders in low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia would improve the reliability and consistency of estimates and help us to create national data management and analytics systems build our technical capacity and allow us to generate higher quality in-country data all of which would further strengthen national health policies and research. All countries should build data repositories to archive existing and prospective health data as well as invest in high performance computing for data analysis and visualizations led by a multi-disciplinary team that understands the evidence demands of health systems.

Training in health metrics and data science in low- and middle-income countries is essential. This could include GBD methods data processing standardizing data inputs and methods analysis and synthesis modeling reviewing estimates and experience in using estimates for policy strategy and decision-making. Training should be provided for people working in ministries of health research institutes public health institutes academia and other relevant stakeholders who generate health data. This will allow countries to jointly analyze national and subnational burden of disease estimates to process and analyze their own data locally and would also provide investment in the local health sector.

Low- and middle-income countries in collaboration with GBD and funding organizations also need to increase their investment in primary data collection systems to improve estimates and fill their data gaps. Data collection could include population and demography causes of death morbidity and disability health risk factors and social determinants of health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2NvbW1vbnNwaXJpdC1jeWJlcmF0dGFjay1yZW5ld3MtcGF0aWVudC1zYWZldHktY29uY2VybnMtYW1pZC1vdXRhZ2VzLWNhcmUtZGVsYXlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CommonSpirit cyberattack renews patient safety concerns amid outages care delays,"A notification from the Department of Health and Human Services to the healthcare sector confirms the cyberattack on CommonSpirit Health and widespread IT outages were brought on by a ransomware attack.

It’s currently unclear just how many of the more than 1000 care sites and 140 hospitals operated by CommonSpirit across 21 states have been impacted. But the incident has led to appointment cancellations and care delays as providers leverage paper processes and medical records at the impacted facilities.

“It is essential that sector stakeholders maintain awareness of threats and take actions to secure their technology systems” HHS officials warned. Providers are being directed to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Shields Up webpage for more information.

The impact of the incident has stretched to at least a dozen hospitals nearly as expansive as the 2020 ransomware attack on Universal Health Services one of the largest U.S. health systems. All 400 U.S. care sites were brought offline for three weeks however electronic health records systems were not directly impacted by the attack. Overall the outages cost UHS $67 million in lost revenue and recovery efforts.

As previously reported the CommonSpirit outages began on or around Oct. 3 spurring electronic health record downtime procedures at CommonHealth subsidiaries and hospitals across the country. Ambulances were diverted at several hospitals across the country immediately following the attack. But it’s unclear whether emergency care diversion is still in place.

“For an organization the size of CommonSpirit to be hit when care delivery is already stretched to the max in so many parts of our country puts numerous health providers and the entire ecosystem of care in the red zone endangering all of us” Carter Groome CEO of First Health Advisory told SC Media.

The impact of the ""incident is still being assessed and the public may not ever get a full account of what is happening right now” Groome added. That doesn’t mean the organization isn’t “putting every bit of expertise and capability into mitigating the immediate risk to patients as care diversion care delay access to critical decision data operational uptime and even patient portal access must be top of mind for the highest levels of leadership.”

While some media outlets have raised concerns about the possible impact on data the real risk of these outages is to patient safety and care morbidities. A certain subset of patients have seen appointments and planned procedures canceled until the outages have ended including those tied to cancer treatments.

Multiple Reddit threads contain unconfirmed reports from users claiming to be nurses across the country expressing concerns with the shutdown.

One patient from Seattle claimed that they’re dealing with a tumor from home and unable to get the medications needed for treatment as the hospital was not able to use their computer systems to confirm the patient’s identity. Instead providers are requesting paper prescriptions. Other users appear to confirm local media coverage that surgeries and other medical care procedures are being delayed including provider appointments.

“Patients suffer when their care is delayed disrupted and otherwise diverted” and the potential consequences of these delays “are indisputable” said Groome. Indeed “a breach to one organization is a breach to our entire critical infrastructure of healthcare.”

“Without a doubt morbidity is increasing because of cyberattacks and we simply cannot just go back to business as usual. I’m beyond frustrated” he added. “This year after year neverending scourge that feels like groundhog day has got to abate. We as a nation can do something about this and it’s about time we get more support from Washington.”

It’s unclear what ransomware variant was used in the attack or the group behind it. The HHS alert notes that “CommonSpirit is coordinating with the law enforcement to understand the full extent of the impact and communicating with the HHS to maintain awareness of what if any impact there may be to patient care.”

In response to the attack HHS is urging all provider organizations to review freely available cybersecurity resources against their current controls given the continued targeting of the healthcare industry by malicious actors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTEvd2VsbC9mYW1pbHkvYW54aWV0eS1zY3JlZW5pbmctcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb24tY2hpbGRyZW4uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health Panel Recommends Screening All Kids 8 and Up for Anxiety (Published 2022),"A panel of medical experts on Tuesday recommended for the first time that primary care doctors screen all children ages 8 to 18 for anxiety new guidance that highlights the ongoing mental health crisis among American youth.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — a volunteer panel of experts who make recommendations about the likely benefits and harms of various preventive health services — also reaffirmed its position that all adolescents ages 12 to 18 should be screened for depression.

In making its recommendations the task force hopes to reduce the number of children whose mental health conditions go undetected and untreated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention some 5.8 million children have been diagnosed with anxiety while 2.7 million have been diagnosed with depression — though some children may be missed or misdiagnosed. Those national estimates also predate the Covid pandemic and there are troubling signs that mental health distress among children intensified in the last few years.

In a New York Times video op-ed Hilton recounted her experience marking the first time she’s opened up in detail about specific instances of abuse.

“Very late at night – this would be around 3 or 4 in the morning – they would take myself and other girls into this room and they would perform medical exams” Hilton claimed. “This wasn’t even with a doctor. It was with a couple different staff members where they would have us lay on the table and put their fingers inside of us. And I don’t know what they were doing but it was definitely not a doctor.”

Along with the alleged sexual abuse the star who has been a strong advocate for the closure of Provo Canyon in recent years has also previously said she was physically and mentally abused during her time at the treatment center.

Hilton shared her experience for the op-ed titled “Can You Punish A Child’s Mental Health Problems Away?” alongside a number of other participants who were sent away to similar treatment facilities as teenagers. “It was really scary and it’s something that I really had blocked out for many years” she added. “But it’s coming back all the time now and I think about it. And now looking back as an adult that was definitely sexual abuse.”

She went into greater detail in a Twitter thread while sharing the op-ed writing: “Sleep-deprived & heavily medicated I didn’t understand what was happening. I was forced to lie on a padded table spread my legs & submit to cervical exams. I cried while they held me down & said ‘No!’ They just said ‘Shut up. Be quiet. Stop struggling or you’ll go to Obs.’ ”

Hilton first opened up about her experience at Provo Canyon School in the 2021 YouTube Originals documentary This Is Paris. She accused staff members of inflicting emotional physical and psychological abuse on her through verbal assault. She also claimed that attendees were regularly monitored while using the bathroom and showering. Last year Hilton appeared in a Utah court to testify against Provo Canyon School. Editor’s picks

“This was a recurring experience not only for me but for other #survivors” she added on Twitter. “I was violated & I am crying as I type this because no one especially a child should be sexually abused. My childhood was stolen from me & it kills me this is still happening to other innocent children.”

Provo Canyon School was purchased by Universal Health Services in 2000 and has declined to comment on allegations prior to the new ownership. But it also hasn’t commented on the alleged continued abuse experienced by patients in the two decades since.

In 2020 Universal Health Services agreed to pay $117 million to resolve alleged violations of the False Claims Act which prohibits billing for medically unnecessary inpatient behavioral health services and failing to provide adequate and appropriate services. Still despite continuing to deny these allegations the company and its centers currently face multiple ongoing lawsuits. In one suit which names 49 plaintiffs more than two dozen people allege sexual abuse by a former medical director according to the Times.

“It’s important to open up about these painful moments so I can heal & help put an end to this abuse” Hilton wrote."

It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.

Set to Beat the Market?

In order to see if VLO is a promising momentum pick let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil refiner holds up.

Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.

For VLO shares are up 6.24% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 4.18% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too as the monthly price change of 0.41% compares favorably with the industry's 0.22% performance as well.

While any stock can see a spike in price it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Valero Energy have increased 8.79% over the past quarter and have gained 44.76% in the last year. In comparison the S&P 500 has only moved -6.33% and -15.85% respectively.

Investors should also pay attention to VLO's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. VLO is currently averaging 4341239 shares for the last 20 days.

Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with VLO.

Over the past two months 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VLO's consensus estimate increasing from $26.94 to $27.55 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Taking into account all of these elements it should come as no surprise that VLO is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term make sure to keep Valero Energy on your short list.

""The charts as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden suggest that Twitter  Valero and Occidental [Petroleum] could have some upside here. I'm more cautious on Twitter because it's an arbitrage play but the other two have my attention"" he said.

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday said that there are three stocks that could be set to rally.

The stock has made a pattern of reaching higher highs and higher lows which is a ""textbook sign of strength"" he said.

At the same time the key moving averages that Boroden watches look bullish. The stock is trading above both the 200-day and 50-day simple moving averages. In addition the 5-day exponential moving average is crossing over the 13-day according to Cramer.

""That's her favorite buy signal"" he said.

Cramer added that Boroden sees Twitter stock easily running to $53.43 or even $54.87. He acknowledged that Elon Musk's back-and-forth with Twitter on their deal for him to purchase the company at $54.20 a share could hurt the stock.

""I think our upside is capped at that level and if something goes wrong wow the stock will plummet through Boroden's support levels in the mid-to-high $40s at which point she says you need to go bearish because the bull thesis is toast"" he said.

OIL COMPANY BLASTS CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS: Valero hit back at California’s Energy Commission (CEC) last week after the agency demanded oil refinery executives explain why despite declining crude oil prices gas prices have spiked.

""[C]rude oil prices are down and industry profits are up yet gas prices have increased by a record $0.84 per gallon in 10 days in California – a $2.50 difference compared to U.S. prices"" CEC Chair David Hochschild wrote in a Sept. 30 letter to executives. ""This degree of divergence from national prices hasn’t happened before regardless of planned or unplanned refinery maintenance and no explanation has been provided. The oil industry owes Californians answers.""

Hochschild accused the executives of not providing an ""adequate and transparent"" explanation for the price spike. He noted that the industry’s ""lower-than-normal"" stockpiles of gasoline appear to be a contributing factor to a tightening gasoline market that has increased gasoline prices over the prior week.

YELLEN SAYS OPEC OIL PRODUCTION CUTS BAD FOR GLOBAL ECONOMY

Hochschild demand that the industry leaders explain why gasoline prices have risen ""despite a sharp downturn in global crude prices no significant unplanned refinery outages in the state and no increases in state taxes or fees.""

Hochschild asked what the State of California could do to address logistics or other obstacles that have contributed to the price increases. He also demanded that refiners explain why they supposedly allowed inventory levels to drop despite ""for months or in some cases years"" that planned maintenance would occur.

In response Valero’s Vice President State Government Affairs Scott N. Folwarkow denied any allegations of ""price conspiracies"" among oil refineries pointing to a federal judge having thrown out another case finding no basis for them.

VALERO

Instead Folwarkow said market price was driven by supply and demand coupled with ""government-imposed costs and specifications.""

He noted that Valero has planned maintenance activity but said the company has planned accordingly to meet its contractual obligations to its customers.

Folwarkow blamed low inventories on post-COVID’s growing demand and limited supply. He said the higher prices in California than in the rest of the U.S. had to do with the state being the ""most expensive operative environment in the country and (being) a very hostile regulatory environment for refining.""

""California policy markers have knowingly adopted policies with the expressed intent of eliminating the refinery sector"" he said. ""California requires refiners to pay very high carbon cap and trade fees and burdened gasoline with cost of the law carbon fuel standards.""



ANOTHER COMPANY FLEES DEM-RUN CITY: Tyson Foods Inc. became the latest large company to announce its departure from Chicago continuing a trend in the city that many have argued is the result of the city's skyrocketing rates of crime and threatens to do harm to its most vulnerable populations.

""You're talking about a situation where you have a hollowed out economy where you have businesses leaving there are no jobs"" Heritage Foundation senior research fellow in the Center for Health and Welfare Policy Robert Moffit told Fox News Digital last month. ""And the people who are desperately hurt by this are mostly low income and black and minority residents who suffer the most from this high crime.""

Moffit's comments came after McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski took aim at Chicago in a mid-September speech arguing that the city's rising crime rates have made it increasingly difficult for companies to operate or find employees.

""We have violent crime that's happening in our restaurants... we're seeing homelessness issues in our restaurants. We're having drug overdoses that are happening in our restaurants"" Kempczinski said at the time. ""So we see in our restaurants every single day what's happening in society at large.""

CHICAGO FACES MORE CORPORATE DEPARTURES AS TYSON FOODS MOVES TO ARKANSAS

Crime in Chicago has spiked during Black Lives Matter riots and the defund the police movement in the aftermath of the 2020 death of George Floyd with the city recording its deadliest year in a quarter-century in 2021 with 797 homicides.

Chicago Police Department Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy told Fox News Digital over the summer that the city has engaged in a ""stealth defunding"" of the police department by failing to provide adequate resources and staffing to the department as officers leave or retire.

The reality has seen crime rise across nearly every category something businesses are taking note of as they look toward the future.

Billionaire Ken Griffin announced earlier this year that he was moving his hedge-fund firm Citadel out of Chicago because of the rising crime a move that was also made by mining equipment giant Caterpillar and Boeing the world's largest aerospace company.

TYSON FOODS INC.

""If people aren’t safe here they’re not going to live here"" Griffin told the Wall Street Journal in April. ""I’ve had multiple colleagues mugged at gunpoint. I’ve had a colleague stabbed on the way to work. Countless issues of burglary. I mean that’s a really difficult backdrop with which to draw talent to your city from.""

Chicago has also seen small businesses flee the area with Gary Rabine founder of the Rabine Group and owner of 13 businesses telling Fox News Digital last month that crime was behind his decision to take his rod paving business elsewhere.

""We would do thousands of jobs a year in the city but as we got robbed more my people operating rollers and pavers we got robbed our equipment would get stolen in broad daylight and there would usually be a gun involved and it got expensive and it got dangerous"" Rabine said.

Rabine also pointed out that the rising crime leads to increased costs in other areas pointing to increased expenses in both security for his businesses and insurance rates.



AUTO RECALL: Rivian Automotive announced on Friday it is recalling almost all the vehicles it has delivered to customers in order to tighten a loose fastener.



The electric truck and SUV maker said the problem could potentially affect drivers' ability to steer.



The recall involves 13000 vehicles because a fastener connecting the vehicles' front upper-control arm and steering knuckle may not be torqued enough.



There have been seven reports potentially related to the issue but no injuries have been reported Rivian said.

EV MAKER RIVIAN SAYS ITS CURRENT MODELS WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR TAX BREAKS

""If you experience excessive noise vibration or harshness from the front suspension or a change in steering performance or feel you should call immediately"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe wrote in a letter to vehicle owners.



The company says it is a quick fix and expects to have finished the repairs on all of them in about 30 days.

The company which was founded in 2009 is aiming to take advantage of a growing appetite among consumers and investors for electric vehicles.

Rivian is among a long line of companies both new and old trying to peel away market share from Tesla.

It went public last year and its market value quickly soared past that of Ford and General Motors but has since come back to earth.

In May Ford trimmed its stake in the company selling 15 million shares.

Rivian's stock is down 67% so far this year.

INFLATION REPORTS DUE: Inflation will be a big focus this week with the release of the September consumer and producer price indices.



However last week’s surge in oil prices won’t be reflected in these reports but they will show up in the October data next month.



In addition to inflation data investors will also weigh reports on retail sales jobless claims and consumer sentiment

But futures markets aren’t waiting around: traders are betting on another 75-basis point rate hike in November the fourth in a row and a 50-basis point increase in December bringing the Federal Funds rate to 4.25%-4.5% by year-end. Those estimates could change in the coming days.

On Wednesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report wholesale inflation for September. The producer price index is expected to rise 0.2% month-over-month according to Refinitiv forecasts after slipping 0.1% in August.

ECONOMIST MOHAMED EL-ERIAN SAYS US ECONOMY ‘ON BUMPY JOURNEY TO BETTER DESTINATION’

Year-over-year prices paid by wholesalers are anticipated to jump 8.3% down from 8.7% in August and the third straight month of slowing growth. It would also be the lowest reading since July 2021 possibly easing rekindled inflation fears.



Excluding food and energy costs core producer prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% monthly in September trailing August’s 0.4% gain. Year-over-year look for growth in core PPI to hold steady at 7.3% in September the sixth straight month of flat-to-slowing growth after a record 9.7% surge in March.

A day later BLS is expected to say the consumer price index rise 0.2% month-over-month in September slightly above August’s 0.1% rise.

On a year-over-year basis watch for prices climb 8.1% in September easing back from August’s hotter-than-expected reading of 8.3% thanks to moderating energy costs (the survey was conducted in the first three weeks of September).

It would also mark the third month in a row of slowing growth after June’s 9.1% surge the highest inflation rate in almost 41 years (since November 1981).

Factoring out volatile food and energy costs the core consumer price index is anticipated to rise 0.5% in September slightly trailing a 0.6% spike the previous month.

Annually core CPI is forecast to climb 6.5% in September. That would be the second month in a row of rising core inflation following a larger-than-expected spike of 6.3% in August. More worrisome for inflation watchers it would match March’s 6.5% spike which was the highest in nearly 40 years.

Energy production or distribution is related to the stocks in the energy sector. Companies engaged in oil and gas drilling refining and exploration and development are included in the energy companies of the industry. Integrated power utility companies using coal and renewable energy are a part of the energy sector.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Companies that produce or supply energy including fossil fuels or renewables are included in the energy industry.

Over the past century the energy industry has played a major role in propelling industrial growth by supplying the remainder of the economy of the energy.

Businesses in the energy sector are categorized according to the type of energy they use like the renewables like solar energy or non-renewables like fossil fuels.

Knowledge of the Energy Sector

The phrase “energy sector” refers to a broad and all-encompassing network of businesses that are both directly and indirectly engaged in the manufacture and supply of the energy that is needed to drive the nation’s economy and support its factors of production and transport.

Businesses in the energy sector use different types of energy. Energy providers are generally divided into one of 2 categories according to where the energy they produce is sourced:

Non-renewable resources include petroleum products natural gas gasoline diesel fuel heating oil nuclear energy and coal.

Renewable energy sources include wind solar hydropower biofuels like ethanol and hydroelectricity. The energy sector makes use of auxiliary sources like electricity. The demand and supplying for energy on a global scale majorly determine energy prices and the financial success of energy producers.

When gasoline prices are high producers of petroleum products often fare well. However as the cost of energy products declines energy corporations make less money. On the other hand when the crude oil prices decline oil refiners gain from the decreasing cost of the raw materials used to make petroleum products like gasoline.

Energy Sector Company Types

Here are a few of the different kinds of businesses you may find in the energy sector. Each has a specific function to fulfill in bringing energy to consumers and companies.

Drilling for and Production of oil and gas

These are the businesses that extract oil and gas through drilling pumping and production. Oil is often removed from the ground as part of the production.

Refining and Pipeline

To refine raw materials like natural gas and oil into completed goods like gasoline transportation must be made from the manufacturing location to the refinery. The businesses that make up this area of the energy industry are known to be the midstream suppliers.

Mining Businesses

Because coal is used to fuel power plants specifically nuclear ones the coal industry could be categorized to become an energy corporation.

Sustainable Power

Over time clean energy has grown in popularity and funding and it is expected that it will play a major role in the energy sector going forward. The wind is one type of renewable energy.

Chemicals

Although many major oil producers like Exxon Mobil are integrative energy producers which means they create different types of electricity and have complete control over the process some businesses specialize in converting petroleum and natural gas into specialty chemicals.

They request that all possible investments be carbon neutral damaging or have some other observable environmental advantage such as lowering water usage because their aim is for every investment to improve the future of our climate.

Based on decades of investment spanning big percentage and business cycles sporadic governmental support for carbon reduction and multiple “boom and bust” cycles of green power sector expansions they have developed the following theories of the foundation for their climate-positive investment thesis:

Technology that is more productive and efficient generates higher economic rewards.

The portfolio risk of a portfolio of smaller assets is lower than that of major centralized utility-scale investments. This is brought on by tendencies towards more decentralization and asset digitization.

The following are the top six benefits of energy efficiency for businesses in 2022:

1. Energy efficiency lowers costs

By improving its energy efficiency your business can save money. Energy used to be viewed as an inevitable expense by many businesses. However more companies are becoming aware that energy use can be controlled and has a direct impact on whether or not they operate financially well.

According to the U.K. government advances in energy efficiency in all non-domestic premises in England and Wales led to 39% savings in 2014. The potential savings on energy bills for enterprises come to £3.7 billion.

The government report exposed £3.7 billion in possible savings of which lighting contributed[p=\£1.1 billion. It uses 20% on average of the total electricity consumed in industrial and commercial structures.

Additionally lighting projects typically have a short return on that investment duration and a low first cost. As a result if your company is just getting started with energy saving lighting is a great place to start.

Energy efficiency initiatives often include upfront expenditure but over the long run tracking and reducing energy consumption will result in more money being available to invest in other parts of your organization.

2. Less danger

Recently the energy markets across the world have become more volatile leading to big price swings. The Department Of Energy predicts that as global population growth and energy demand increase this pattern will continue. In the U.K. energy costs have climbed dramatically with gas and electricity prices tripling between 2005 and 2018. To make matters worse energy costs increased by 5.3% in just three of 2018 (February through May) primarily as a result of increases in the cost of wholesale gasoline and electricity.

One of the best methods to lessen the effect volatile oil markets could have on your business is to produce your own power on-site. This could not be possible for your company for many reasons. The optimum strategy is as follows using energy as effectively as feasible is one way to safeguard your business.

3. Increasing brand awareness

Energy efficiency has several benefits outside of financial ones. Being energy-efficient can better your firm’s image in a green society and improve the productivity of your company. Just be careful not to just go green because this could diminish the importance of your business.

Studies show that a strong energy-saving strategy can improve relationships with customers suppliers and other partners. A third of consumers (33%) are now choosing to purchase goods or services from companies they believe are contributing to the environment or the community according to a global Unilever study.

Sainbury’s Google Microsoft and Coca-Cola are some of the few businesses that are trying to cut back on their energy usage. For instance Sainsbury’s has promised to install LED lighting in more than 450 of their locations in June 2017.

4. Fuel efficiency can improve working conditions for employees.

As you can see fuel efficiency can reduce costs and improve the reputation of your business but did you realize that it could be essential in creating the greatest workplaces for your employees? Previously the concept of energy efficiency was seen to be the threat to comfort. But as recent research has presented energy efficiency can really improve employee comfort well-being and productivity.

Employees who work for companies that place a high priority on energy efficiency tend to be more productive according to a study published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology. The investigation found that adequate illumination and properly outfitted Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment were the main factors in this productivity boost.

Your company’s energy-saving strategy can help it retain its current workforce and keep them content and productive and recruit fresh talent. According to a recent study 79% of millennials think about an employer’s environmental policies when choosing where to work. If your company intends to hire people in this demographic you must ensure that your energy-saving strategy is effective and current.

5. The environment benefits from it.

With proper reason concern over climate change has increased recently. The United Kingdom Parliament declared a climate emergency even in 2019. The main cause of climate change greenhouse gas emissions is still largely attributed to energy use. Everyone is therefore under obligation to use electricity more wisely.

Fascinatingly people and homes are frequently in the spotlight. However it was estimated that the business sector would emit 65.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2018 or nearly 18% of all emissions in the United Kingdom. Businesses must therefore unquestionably majorly reduce their usage.

Making a move to a 100% renewable power source as Google and Apple have accomplished is one of the best methods for a business to reduce the environmental effect of its energy usage. More resources than ever provide 100 percent renewable energy and prices have recently gotten considerably very competitive. This is great news because it presents how cutting your company’s energy use may go in tandem with reducing your carbon footprint which is beneficial to both your business and the environment!

Programa alertas de ofertas

Amazon pone miles de artículos en descuento durante los eventos de ofertas Prime así que puede ser abrumador saber dónde empezar (y tentador hacer compras impulsivas). Concéntrate en tus compras haciendo una lista de los artículos que te interesan antes de visitar el sitio.

Puedes consultar CamelCamelCamel (en inglés) para ver el historial de precios del producto en Amazon y así saber si el costo determinado es realmente un buen precio.

KidKraft se encargó de solucionar ese problema con un producto de gran tamaño y algo caro: una casita de juguete de tres pisos que mide 4 ½ pies de alto y 5 de ancho justo a la medida de las muñecas American Girl que miden 18 pulgadas de alto.

La casa tiene un precio de $598 y se exhibe en las 11 tiendas que tiene en el país incluyendo la única que hay en el Norte de Texas en Galleria Dallas.

La marca American Girl tuvo una especie de renacimiento en 2020 y 2021 después de años de caída en ventas pero sus ventas volvieron a caer un 21% en el primer semestre de 2022.

KidKraft fundada en Dallas en 1968 ha estado bajo la dirección de Geoff Walker exejecutivo de Mattel desde 2019.

Walker pasó casi 24 años en Mattel y era director de innovación cuando se fue después de negociar colaboraciones con Warner Bros. y Disney.

Susan Russo vicepresidenta de marca y mercadotecnia de productos de KidKraft dice que las dos marcas “piensan igual” en su misión de crear juguetes que despierten la imaginación.

Si bien la alianza era natural “la trayectoria de Geoff y su relación con Mattel ciertamente fueron fundamentales para sacar adelante esas pláticas” dijo.

El diálogo entre American Girl y KidKraft empezó durante la pandemia refirió Russo “cuando el comercio electrónico era una prioridad para ambas marcas y la fecha de lanzamiento para esta colaboración siempre estuvo programada para la temporada navideña 2022″.

KidKraft es proveedor de grandes cadenas minoristas como Amazon Walmart Costco y Target y es propiedad de la firma de capitales de inversión MidOcean Partners desde 2016.

KidKraft tiene 400 empleados vende al mayoreo y también directamente al consumidor.

Para esta temporada navideña KidKraft introduce una nueva categoría: los juguetes para juegos de rol y experiencia de inmersión.

La compañía no quiso revelar el monto de sus ventas anuales.

La pandemia ayudó

Antes de la pandemia American Girl estaba lastrando las ventas de Mattel cuando la venerable marca de muñecas sufrió caídas trimestrales de 25% y 30% y aumentaron sus gastos en sus tiendas.

Encima creció la competencia de copias más baratas y la marca se desvió de sus personajes históricos y sus historias.

Las ventas en internet despegaron durante la pandemia cuando los padres gastaron más en juguetes debido al confinamiento y a que las tiendas estuvieron cerradas temporalmente en 2020 y 2021.

Por primera vez en cuatro años las ventas navideñas de American Girl aumentaron en el último trimestre de 2020; y en 2021 tuvo ventas de $278 millones un 4% más que el año anterior.

La compañía de Wisconsin ahora opera 11 tiendas después de cerrar de forma permanente durante la pandemia en Atlanta Denver Kansas City Seattle Scottsdale Arizona y Hershey Pennsylvania.

El mes pasado también cerró su tienda de Miami al vencer su contrato de arrendamiento.

En mayo de 2021 American Girl anunció el relanzamiento de sus seis personajes originales al reconocer que la primera generación de dueñas de muñecas American Girl ya eran madres y que podían crear experiencias multigeneracionales con el regreso de las muñecas.

Ese es el caso de Jennifer Wettstein de 38 años de Kansas City quien estaba en la tienda de Galleria Dallas con su hija Anna de 8 años el miércoles.

“Yo tenía a Molly y mi hermana a Samantha. Nosotras leímos todos los libros y ahora mi hija está creciendo con ellas también” dijo Wettstein.

Los Wettstein estaban en Dallas visitando a familiares y fueron a Galleria porque la tienda de Kansas City había cerrado.

A la muñeca Truly Me de Anna le peinaron su cabello le perforaron las orejas y le dieron un nuevo leotardo y un vestido.

“Tenemos la revista (American Girl) en casa y ahí lo leí”.

Despite all the talk of modernisation the London market’s day-to-day operations are still defined by manual processing low productivity and clunky trading interaction writes Ben Bolton.

Last month we wrote about the perceptions of underwriters and brokers in relation to their hopes for better trading tools and their (possibly misplaced) belief that everyone will be e-trading within the next 18 months.

Sadly in 2022 risk placing is still a throwback to the 1990s where email and PDFs prevail and productivity tanks as human effort is duplicated or triplicated through interminable rekeying and poor data integration.

On any given morning in the London insurance district you’ll find hundreds of broking teams picking up overnight risk requests on email printing them out for evaluation before loading them back onto email to send out to underwriters for quotation.

As the day wears on these quotes are assessed and fed back by underwriters over email and then sent out again by the brokers again on email to the international markets.

This unremitting and largely manual process is one that every broker and underwriter recognises as inefficient slow and demoralising.

Two trading systems – PPL and Whitespace – are in play in the market and while Whitespace is by far the most user-friendly option PPL has the dominant share of users.

Despite its market share PPL is still essentially a document repository which offers little to underwriters and brokers looking for tech that can oil the wheels of the trading process itself.

After many false dawns there may be hope on the horizon however – “Next Gen” PPL is promised for early 2023 Whitespace now owned by global tech company Verisk is building out its popular system and others like Acrisure are also developing fast.

So competition may look like the cavalry coming over the hill but will these new systems really meet the users’ needs?

Gracechurch’s recent research highlighted the top three must-haves from trading systems:

#1 Integration with back-office systems: Standalone systems perpetuate multiplication of effort so integration would be the biggest win for any trading system reducing energy-sapping rekeying and unleashing productivity and innovation gains.

“Straight-through processing. In the life of a risk only one person in the entire chain from purchaser to ultimate risk-bearer should have to key in any details of the risk to any system.”

#2 Communications technology support for remote trading: Face-to-face is still the preferred way of trading but systems that support trading communications in a hybrid work environment would be another big win. Some suggest built-in chat and/or video functionality to allow better collaboration between underwriter and broker.

“A shared platform where broker and underwriter can walk through a slip as if doing it face-to-face.”

#3 User-friendly systems that are continuously improved: One of the biggest frustrations with PPL is the static nature of the system where promised updates don’t happen or only happen as big infrequent Next Gen improvements – users want to see a ‘Kaizen’ approach in which trading systems continually evolve to meet user needs.

“Easy to use. Easy to send to the underwriter. Easy to make changes to. The e-platform can ‘talk’ to other computer systems (the insurer’s or the broker’s) and populate data fields in those respective systems automatically.”

So contrary to popular opinion brokers and underwriters completely get that tech is coming know what good looks like and are prepared to embrace these new tools of the trade – as long as they are fit for purpose enable something better and evolve at the pace of the market rather than that of the technology providers.

Let’s hope that the competition can rise to the challenge because if it can’t then London’s productivity problem won’t go away anytime soon.

VZ,Verizon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcml6b24uY29tL2Fib3V0L25ld3MvdmVyaXpvbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1uZXctdGVjaC1tb25pdG9yLWFjdGl2aXR5LWhvbWUtd2lmadIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon launches new tech to monitor activity on home WiFi,"NEW YORK – Verizon today announced the launch of two easy-to-use home technologies: Home Awareness and Device Identification. The new home solutions provide customers with greater visibility into their homes and an added sense of security – with no additional cost.

As more and more customers maximize capabilities of their home Wi-Fi networks by adding connected devices such as entertainment energy management and voice activated smart speakers – to name a few – they can now enjoy new functionality and get even greater value with added visibility into the home.

Home Awareness

Home Awareness uses WiFi sensing technology to detect motion and report activity in your home via the My Fios App. The technology patented by Origin Wireless a Verizon Ventures portfolio company enables select Fios router models to detect disruptions in existing WiFi signals in the home and let the user know if there is unexpected motion. Verizon and Origin Wireless will continue working together to enhance the in-home experience with additional features based on this Wi-Fi sensing technology.

“We’re bringing to market a technology that will help customers better understand their home without the need for cameras or sensors” said Pavan Challa Director of Product Management at Verizon. “We’re excited to partner with Origin Wireless on this new state-of-the-art technology that gives Verizon customers even more value for their money” Challa said.

When using Home Awareness customers can see activity reported in the My Fios App through a live dashboard and historical views. To learn more about Home Awareness visit: http://verizon.com/homeawareness.

Device ID

Verizon is also partnering with SAM Seamless Network another Verizon Ventures portfolio company and leading provider of cloud-native network security and intelligence services to provide customers with additional peace of mind with Device Identification.

With Device ID customers can monitor their home network for new or previously unrecognized devices. With greater visibility into the devices connected to their home network they can manage certain details of devices on the network like customized naming conventions allowing for better control of their home network and connected devices. Device ID is available to all customers on eligible Fios Routers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjcndpcmVsZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIyMTAxMC9jYXJyaWVycy92ZXJpem9uLWV4cGFuZHMtZnJlZS1sb3ctaW5jb21lLWZpeGVkLXdpcmVsZXNzLWFjY2Vzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon expands free low-income fixed wireless access,"Eligible recipients now can get LTE 5G or fiber connections through the new program

Verizon has announced an expansion of free broadband connectivity services for low-income households. The company’s new Verizon Forward Program promises home internet service for qualifying households using 5G LTE or Fios at no cost. Customers enrolled in the program do not have data caps contracts or equipment charges to deal with either. The company has put the new program under the aegis of its “Citizen Verizon” corporate social responsibility business plan first announced in 2020.

Verizon noted that the new program taps into resources made available through the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC’s) Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). In April FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel told Congress the program had already reached more than 11 million households across the country. The ACP was originally established as the Emergency Broadband Benefit as part of COVID-19 relief programs but received $14.2 billion in expanded funding through the Infrastructure and Jobs Act when it was renamed.

Expanding internet access especially to rural and historically underserved communities has been a key initiative of the Biden administration. In May the administration began to open the $45 billion spigot for nationwide broadband development. That effort coordinated through the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) happened parallel to the expansion of ACP funds.

The ACP provides monthly discounts of up to $30 per month for Internet service ($75 per month for households on qualifying native lands) and a one-time discount of up to $100 on hardware to connect to the Internet like laptops desktop computers and tablets. Households eligible for the ACP must be at or below 200% of Federal poverty guidelines or if household members meet some means-based criteria such as enrollment in public assistance programs.

While Verizon is leveraging federal ACP money to underwrite its efforts the company emphasized that its Verizon Forward Program offers free service not discounted service that may incur other hidden costs through fees or equipment rental charges. Normal prices for Verizon’s FWA range from $25 to $70 a month depending on service level and type.

In March Verizon announce Fios Forward a subsidized program specifically aimed at Verizon customers who live in areas services by the company’s Fios fiber optic Internet services. Fios Forward provided ACP customers with free access assuming they’re already enrolled in one of Verizon’s Fios Mix & Match plans. The new Verizon Forward Program expands enrollment for customers not services in areas equipped with Fios but where Verizon can provide Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) services using LTE or 5G instead.

Verizon’s chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg called home Internet service “not just nice to have but a necessity. It is critical that we offer accessible affordable and usable digital solutions. Income should not be a barrier for reliable connectivity which is why it’s so important that we provide free Verizon Home Internet to ACP-qualifying customers across the country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy92ZXJpem9uLTVnLXdpcmVsZXNzLWludGVybmV0LWNvbWNhc3QtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLTIwMjIxMDExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon begins launch of 5G internet-to-home service in Philly,"Verizon has launched 5G wireless home-internet service in Philadelphia. It’s not available to all city residents because of where the company has placed small cell towers on telephone poles and city property. But it is competing with Comcast Corp.’s Xfinity service.

To qualify for a discounted price of $25 a month with Verizon a new customer must subscribe to a Verizon unlimited mobile plan. Otherwise the price is $50 a month.

5G wireless to homes is the latest battleground between telecom and cable companies. Mobile phone companies have invested in wireless spectrum and small cells to expand high-speed internet services to residences competing with cable companies that dominate the internet-to-home market with wires.

Comcast’s network is available to 60 million businesses and homes and it has signed about 32 million to its internet services.

Earlier this year Comcast reported its first-ever decline of residential internet customers a loss of 10000 connections in the company’s second quarter. Comcast executives attributed some of that loss to new 5G wireless competition in rural areas though Verizon and T-Mobile also are expanding into cities and suburban areas.

At the same time Comcast and cable companies are offering wireless mobile phone services taking those customers from mobile-phone firms.

T-Mobile says that its high-speed home internet service is available to 40 million residences in the United States and that it has signed up 1.5 million customers. In the Philadelphia area the T-Mobile home-internet service — also called fixed-wireless — is available to 530000 houses a company spokeswoman said. But customers must check availability.

Nationally Verizon has 384000 consumer fixed-wireless customers in the second quarter up from 216000 in the first quarter the company reported. Verizon has sold off most of its wireline-based businesses though it still owns Fios in the Philadelphia area.

Critics say that 5G is not as reliable as wireline internet such as Fios and Xfinity and that the wireless companies prioritize mobile phone traffic on networks over internet-to-the-home service.

Verizon’s online coverage map shows big gaps in Feltonville Hunting Park Allegheny West Pennsport and other neighborhoods where the wireless service is available on main roads and in public spaces but not on many side streets within neighborhoods creating a patchwork of availability.

“People want options” said Verizon spokesman Andrew Testa. “Most people only have one or two options for home internet.” Verizon’s 5G service will be an additional one he said.

Verizon officially launched 5G home internet in Philadelphia on Sept. 22. Consumers can go to verizon.com/home to plug in their address and see what service — Fios or wireless — is available to their locations.

Verizon customers are expected to install the home wireless service themselves. The company has posted an instructional video on YouTube to show how.

Verizon doesn’t disclose how many Philadelphia residents have access to the new 5G home-internet service that supplements the wire-based Fios internet service in Philadelphia the company says.

Verizon agreed to make Fios available throughout Philadelphia with its franchise agreement in 2009 to offer television services. Verizon fulfilled the pledge the city has said though there have been complaints that Fios is not available to all Philadelphia residents.

Spokesman Testa said that Verizon continues to expand Fios and 5G in Philadelphia.

“I don’t think that 5G will be a replacement for fiber-to-the-home” said Brandon Forester national organizer for the nonprofit advocacy group MediaJustice. “There are a lot of places that lack fiber. In urban areas it’s the areas that have been redlined.”

No that's a Verizon 'jackup rig' between Greenport Shelter Island - The Suffolk Times,"The jackup rig or lift boat stands in 95 feet of water near the North Ferry. (Credit: Martin J. Dempsey)

An extremely large “lift boat” is dominating the horizon out by the North Ferry these days prompting considerable speculation among residents.

Its proximity to the ferry as well as the PSEG cable adjacent to the slips suggested one of those entities might have a project underway.

However Shelter Island Bay Constable Beau Payne who’s charged with keeping a sharp eye on the extensive varieties of vessels plying Island waters confirmed the “lift boat” is the work of Verizon.

“Verizon is taking core samples” of the bay floor he said indicating the company may be exploring the feasibility of laying cable between Shelter Island and Greenport.

“I wish I could tell you it was something more exotic” he laughed suggesting theories ranging from discovering sunken treasure to drilling for oil might make their way into local chatter.

The vessel consists of a barge mounted on stilts which are currently standing in 95 feet of water and can be moved to take samples from different parts of the sea floor.

Given the size of the vessel also known as a jackup rig it will probably become a familiar part of the landscape since it’s expected to continue the project until Dec. 15 according to Mr. Payne."

Now the company reportedly has a new divestment target in mind.

Viatris is considering a sale of its consumer health products in Europe in a deal that could fetch 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) Bloomberg reports citing people familiar with the matter.

The drugmaker has tapped Jefferies to scout for buyers but no final decisions have been made the people said according to Bloomberg.

Viatris didn’t immediately reply to a Fierce Pharma request for comment.

A European over-the-counter sale would follow some smaller OTC castoffs in the U.S. The generics giant recorded $96.7 million in proceeds from asset sales in 2021 which it attributed “primarily” to a group of U.S. OTC products.

The report also comes as Viatris works to wrap up a $3.3 billion deal to shed its biosimilars portfolio to partner Biocon Biologics. The companies unveiled that transaction in February and expect it to be complete by the end of the year.

When announcing the biosimilar deal Viatris CEO Michael Goettler said the company has identified additional sell-off targets to simplify its business. All told Viatris hopes to generate up to $9 billion in pretax proceeds from these initiatives by the end of 2023. The European OTC sale if it becomes a reality would likely count toward that goal.

As to how Viatris plans to spend the money Goettler said during an August conference call that the “base” goal is to meet the company’s financial commitments for 2022 and 2023. These include paying dividends to shareholders and paying down debt. As for share buybacks and business development “we’ll make those decisions with value for shareholders in mind at the right time and for the right reasons” the CEO said.

Consumer health products aren’t exactly Viatris’ focus these days and they rarely came up during public discussions with investors. Like many other biopharma companies Viatris is now more interested in innovative products with higher profit margins. The company has identified ophthalmology gastrointestinal diseases and dermatology as its areas of focus.

Across the industry pharma companies are increasingly distancing themselves from OTC products in favor of novel therapies. GSK just spun off its Pfizer consumer health franchise into Haleon and Johnson & Johnson is in the process to do the same with its own consumer health business to be called Kenvue. As one of the last Big Pharma holdouts Sanofi has been slimming down its OTC franchise shifting its focus to switching prescription meds into first-in-class OTC options.

The Viatris European OTC franchise could draw interest from private equity firms that want to beef up their existing OTC businesses or a drugmaker that wants to grow its business in Europe Bloomberg's sources told the news service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEwLTExL3ZpYXRyaXMtc2FpZC10by1jb25zaWRlci1zYWxlLW9mLTMtYmlsbGlvbi1ldXJvcGVhbi1vdGMtYXNzZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viatris Said to Weigh Sale of $3 Billion European OTC Assets,"Why did this happen?

Administered in a dose of 480 mg per day the formulation is the basis of the drug Tecfidera which doctors use to treat multiple sclerosis.

Biogen believes that generic drugs manufactured by Neuraxpharm Hexal and Viatris (formerly Mylan) infringe EP 873 with the company applying for injunctions against the three companies at the Regional Court Düsseldorf (case IDs: 4b O 50/22 4b O 54/22 and 4b O 5r/22). In filing the cases Biogen hoped to prevent the sale of the competing products.

In parallel Biogen also filed injunction proceedings against Viatris in France (case ID: 22/5579).

Biogen stumbles at EPO

However Neuraxpharm and Hexal are among five parties that filed an objection against EP 873 at the European Patent Office. The patent-in-suit arose from a divisional application of parent patent EP 21 37 537 which the first instance EPO Opposition Division revoked due to lack of inventive step. In January 2022 Biogen appealed to the Boards of Appeal. However the boards also revoked the patent due to added matter.

In view of the EPO’s decision on the parent patent Düsseldorf Regional Court also considered the validity of divisional patent EP 873 insufficiently secured to justify handing down a preliminary injunction. Biogen appealed against the decision.

Furthermore the Judicial Court Paris also saw reasonable doubt as to the validity of the patent and refused to grant a preliminary injunction. In parallel Biogen is fighting over the patent in Sweden Ireland and the Czech Republic.

Tried and tested

Biogen relies on its regular advisor Rospatt Osten Pross. A team led by partner Thomas Musmann advises the client on numerous patent disputes. The patent attorneys at df-mp also have a long-standing client relationship with the originator company.

Name partner Sandra Pohlman was not only responsible for filing the patent-in-suit but also represents Biogen in various opposition proceedings most recently against Polpharma in the dispute over another MS drug natalizumab.

In France the pharmaceutical company relies on Hoyng ROKH Monegier. Paris-based partner Benoît Strowel regularly acts in cross-border pharma cases.

He has already cooperated with Rospatt Osten Pross in the past for example for Ceva in the dispute against Bayer/Elanco over a veterinary drug.

Herbert Smith Freehills is coordinating the international proceedings for Biogen with Milan-based partner Sebastian Moore leading.

Bird & Bird has already advised and litigated for Neuraxpharm in the past. For the technical issues the pharmaceutical company retained a team of patent attorneys from Ter Meer Steinmeister & Partner which also represents the client in the opposition proceedings concerning EP 873.

Generics in Europe

Gleiss Lutz acted for Hexal marking the first time the firm has represented the company in a patent dispute. The generics producer also regularly retains Bird & Bird for patent litigation.

Viatris which emerged in 2020 from the merger of Dutch company Mylan with the then-Pfizer subsidiary Upjohn is a regular client of Taylor Wessing.

For example the German practice was recently active in proceedings against Bayer over Nexavar. In addition the UK practice represented the generics company in a dispute with Flynn over an insomnia drug.

In France Viatris’ predecessor Mylan has long relied on IP boutique Schertenleib. Here name partner Denis Schertenleib represented the company in the French part of the cross-border proceedings against Novartis over fingolimod.

B&B Spoilers Recap Highlights

Over in Aspen Steffy Forrester Finnegan (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) was one happy kid when she realized her plan worked. All her nagging paid off and her mommy and daddy are a couple again. Oh joy! The trio wasted no time videoing Thomas (Matthew Atkinson) to spread the good news.

READ THIS: Find out what’s happening next on Bold and the Beautiful.

Taylor Hayes (Krista Allen) was beside herself with happiness. She never thought this would happen. Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) made a promise to Taylor and Steffy that he would protect her heart from now on…forever and ever and ever. Oh boy Taylor is one lucky lady! She was so giddy she decide to take a moment upstairs with Steffy to collect herself.

B&B Recap: Brooke Lost The Game

Meanwhile Brooke Logan Forrester (Katherine Kelly Lang) was reminiscing about her “destiny” during her mad dash to the property. Sadly by the time she made it to the house it was over. Ridge was with Taylor and her marriage was caput.

She caught up with Ridge when he decided to get some fresh air. He hardly got a few steps from the house before Brooke pulled up in a chauffeured jeep and ran after him. She demanded to know what he was doing at the property. Ridge shocked her by telling her he was with Taylor now.

The Bold and the Beautiful Recap: Thomas Was All Smiles

Back in Los Angles Douglas Forrester (Henry Joseph Samiri) played a joke on his dad using his voice app. He pretended to be his great-grandpa saying he didn’t need to do his homework. Thomas scolded the little boy for playing such games and told him to stop using that app altogether. No good comes from practical jokes.

After sending Douglas off Thomas got busy telling Eric Forrester (John McCook) and Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis) about his parent’s reunion. The couple was shocked and dismayed Brooke didn’t make it to Aspen in time. How sad.

Thomas was not sad of course and boasted about Brooke’s downfall. His father deserves a loyal woman and that certainly isn’t Brooke and never has been. Taylor is the best woman (blah blah blah). Donna and Eric certainly were not happy to hear all the Brooke bashing.

B&B Spoilers Recap Highlights

Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) tried to appeal to her husband’s sense of reasoning but no reasoning was to be had. Not only did Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) flat-out dump her and insist he was going back to Taylor Hayes (Krista Allen) but he refused to give her a reason why.

READ THIS: Find out what’s happening next on Bold and the Beautiful.

All Ridge would say is Brooke “knew why” she was being downgraded to ex-wife and it was time to admit it. Brooke was understandably confused and cried for Ridge to come home and sort things out. All he did was grimace and shake his head.

B&B Recap: More Family Feuds

Inside the Aspen cabin Taylor and Steffy Forrester Finnegan (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) were as giddy as school girls over Taylor’s big win. That is until they noticed Brooke outside. Taylor insisted she wasn’t worried but Steffy was so panicked she even called Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson).

Thomas got the call as he was basically laughing in Donna Logan’s (Jennifer Gareis) face. Her sister lost his mother won blah blah blah. Donna and Eric Forrester (John McCook) warned him to not count Brooke out yet.

The trio went back and forth over what Brooke Ridge and Taylor’s future holds. Donna was Team Brooke naturally. Thomas was absolutely on his mother’s side. As for Eric he spoke highly of both women but admitted he had a soft spot for Brooke. They do share a past that includes children after all.

When Thomas answered the phone to Steffy a bit of a tiff broke out between her and Donna when the latter revealed she was the one who directed Brooke to Aspen. Steffy demanded Donna keep her nose out of the family’s business (hi pot meet kettle). Donna was so heated she asked Eric to take her for a drive.

The Bold and the Beautiful Recap: The Truth Came Out!

Once alone in the mansion Thomas was very proud of himself. He smirked about finally besting Brooke. A call to CPS isn’t something Ridge will ever be able to forgive. Of course it wasn’t Brooke who called at all. It was Thomas using the voice-changing app his son likes to play with. What a tricky trickster!

Send us all of your questions about the new credit card surcharge. We are listening: ask@cbc.ca.

As of last week you may be paying an additional fee if you choose to pay with your credit card. That's because Canadian retailers can now charge customers using credit cards to pay following a long-standing lawsuit with Visa and MasterCard that was settled earlier this year.

Canadian businesses launched a class-action lawsuit against the two companies in 2011 and the settlement earlier this year refunded them hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fees — known as interchange fees — that they pay any time a customer pays with credit. The settlement also gave them permission to pass those charges on to customers directly which they weren't allowed to do before.

Previously businesses were absorbing the cost of these so-called interchange fees but now many are looking to make up for lost revenue by charging their patrons.

The new rules laid out in the settlement will not apply to Quebec because of the province's Consumer Protection Act which forbids this type of fee.

But what does it all mean for you? We've received a lot of questions from our audience and have answered some of them below.

Why are the credit card fees so high at 2.4 per cent? Couldn't they be capped at 1 per cent?

Actually credit card interchange fees are sometimes higher than 2.4 per cent but the surcharge for customers has been capped at that number due to the settlement.

However the surcharge amount you may be charged when paying depends on which credit card you use.

""The higher the premium of the card the higher the interchange fee"" said Luciana Brasil a partner at Vancouver-based law firm Branch MacMaster LLP which worked on the class-action lawsuit that led to the settlement.

That means the more points and rewards you receive from using your credit card the higher you can expect the surcharge to be.

Merchants can also choose to add the surcharge by company brand meaning Visa or MasterCard or they can add it to product types meaning types of Visas or types of MasterCards Brasil added.

The average interchange fee in Canada is 1.4 per cent but depending on the card it could be up to two per cent or more. Regardless of the cap however merchants cannot surcharge more than the actual cost of what is being purchased or paid for.

""It's not a money-making charge. It's a cost recovery charge"" said Brasil.

Why are we paying more [interchange fees] than Europeans and others?

In many parts of the world including the European Union Israel the United Kingdom China and Australia interchange fees have been capped at less than one per cent.

On the other hand Canada has some of the highest interchange fees in the world with the average being 1.4 per cent.

Why this is the case is still unclear. However credit card companies determine these rates.

""It's a question for the networks"" said Brasil.

Merchants may choose to levy a surcharge on the company brand such as Visa or MasterCard or they can add it to product types meaning specific types of Visas or MasterCards. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)

She says her and her team were previously told these fees need to be higher in Canada in order to maintain all the different levels of services that are provided in connection with providing credit to people.

However Australia one of the countries where interchange fees are legally capped is able to provide a comparable level of services for much less.

Understanding why there is such a significant difference is a question they posed in the litigation Brasil says but never received an answer because the case was settled.

There has been talk of introducing legislation to control the fees especially for small- and medium-sized businesses but so far there has not been any news from Ottawa.

Can a surcharge be applied if I use my Visa Debit card?

No a surcharge cannot be applied if you use your Visa Debit card or your Debit MasterCard card. It only applies to credit cards Brasil says.

The debit cards use Interac typically even if labelled as Visa Debit or Debit MasterCard.

This applies to pre-authorized debit transactions such as bill payments as well — they cannot have a surcharge because those bills are using debit. In fact some of your bills can't even be paid with credit cards such as your property tax bill because it's too expensive said Rubina Ahmed-Haq a personal finance expert based in Toronto.

How will added credit card fees affect my buying habits?

Whether it's the increase of self-checkout stations at the grocery store or your local coffee shop that has gone cashless many businesses have recently opted for more frequent use of card transactions — both debit and credit.

With the rise of cashless options and the introduction of credit card surcharges more Canadians will likely be more inclined to pay with Interac via tap options.

""I think the only thing it's going to do is make people more used to using debit but you can use the debit tap thing in all of those cashless environments"" said Brasil. ""I don't think it's going to affect the ability to pay in a cashless environment.""

Debit is also much cheaper for the merchant she added.

However adding a surcharge on the credit card fees may change customer behaviour whether that's changing your buying habits or your mode of payment experts say.

It's also not for certain that all or even many businesses will implement the surcharge.

""My impression is that most businesses are not going to apply this surcharge because they don't want to scare customers away"" said Ahmed-Haq.

When it comes to bringing customers into your door and not your competitors choosing not to add the surcharge might be the answer.

""If you have a local coffee shop that you go to or you eat at a restaurant can you imagine if they say we are now adding a surcharge how that would impact people's behaviour"" she said. ""It's really easy to go next door.""

Instead she expects grocery stores to be the first to implement the charge because they are unavoidable for people to feed their families."

The agreement between Stellantis and GME Resources Limited — which owns a nickel and cobalt project in western Australia — is the latest example of automakers moving to shore up supplies of key raw materials deep into the supply chain to meet the capacity for their EV plans.

The deal with GME is for the ""future sale of quantities of battery grade nickel and cobalt sulphate products"" from the NiWest Nickel-Cobalt Project according to a news release. That project is expected to produce approximately 90000 tons per year of battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulphate for electric vehicles. A feasibility study for the project is slated to start this month according to Stellantis and GME.

""Every day Stellantis is working to provide our customers clean safe affordable cutting-edge freedom of mobility"" Maxime Picat chief purchasing and supply chain officer for the transatlantic automaker said in a statement. ""Securing the raw material sources and battery supply will strengthen Stellantis' value chain for electric vehicle battery production and equally important help the company achieve its aggressive decarbonization target.""

Stellantis has said it plans to transition 100% of its passenger sales mix in Europe to battery electric vehicles by 2030. And by that time it expects for half of its passenger car and light-duty truck sales mix in the U.S. to be battery electric. It aims to be carbon neutral by 2038.

In a statement Paul Kopejtka managing director of GME said that a definitive agreement with Stellantis ""would be a critical step in being able to progress the NiWest Project through to commercial operations"" and said that GME hopes the MOU is ""the first step in a long-term partnership.""

Across the industry automakers have been working to secure raw materials for EV batteries in response to government policies and growing consumer demand for all-electric vehicles.

Earlier this year Stellantis inked deals with Vulcan Energy and Controlled Thermal Resources for supplies of lithium hydroxide for Europe and North America respectively.

General Motors Co. earlier this year announced new supply agreements that it said would help secure all of the raw materials it needs for EV batteries to meet a 2025 goal of having 1 million units of annual EV capacity in North America. And in July Ford Motor Co. executives detailed several deals the company reached to shore up raw materials for battery production as they announced that the automaker had secured 100% of the battery capacity it needs to hit annual EV production capacity of 600000 units by the end of next year.

All three Detroit automakers have announced joint ventures to produce EV batteries in North America.

Berkley MI- Republica is a Downtown Berkley restaurant with creative food and drink options. It was a great place to visit for The Revolution – a grass-fed beef burger topped with smoke gouda bacon fried egg onion ring arugula tomato and spicy mayo. This amazing burger was topped only by the Smokey Eyes craft cocktail. The best drink I’ve had in my life was made with smokey Mezcal passion fruit liquor cucumber lime and ginger beer. So good. My friend ordered the Flower Roast – a roasted cauliflower served with a tasty walnut garlic pesto sauce. Plus we feasted on Mitch’s Pita Bread and Dip.

Other choices include the tomato fennel soup stuffed eggplant pistachio salmon and spicy goat cheese crustini. The Village Burger is made with lamb topped with feta dill green onion Greek yogurt and yayas beans. There’s also the Buffalo and Blue Chicken featuring organic free range grilled chicken topped with buffalo sauce celery apple and blue cheese slaw.

The beverage menu is exciting as well. The Newest Fashion drink for example includes Traverse City bourbon sweet vermouth luxardo cherries orange and walnut bitters. The Buzzed Bee has Aquavit St. Germain yellow chartreuse and grapefruit. And for something sweet there’s Hard Candy made with vodka sour cherry fresh squeezed lemonade and a sugar rim.

Republica has been serving the Berkley community since 2013. They’re located at 1999 Coolidge Highway. Learn more at www.republicaberkley.com.

City Manager Paul Brake outlined the grant through a federal pilot program under the U.S. Department of Transportation at Monday night’s City Commission meeting.

Elected officials in Royal Oak Berkley Oak Park and Huntington Woods all have to participate to qualify for the grant.

Brake said the grant request will be submitted within a week and cities can get funds within 90 days if it is approved.

“This could bring a transformative change to 11 Mile Road” Brake told commissioners.

Royal Oak is considering road diets streetscape improvements and adding bike lanes to some sections of 11 Mile Road between Stephenson Highway and Woodward Avenue.

Those changes would calm traffic slow motorists’ speed and improve safety for pedestrians and drivers officials said.

The goal among the four participating cities is to improve connectivity between the communities.

“We are reimagining 11 Mile and creating a more pedestrian environment” Brake said.

Besides narrowing the number of lanes along most stretches of the major road the effort would include adding pedestrian islands planting trees and installing some rain gardens.

“Many of these improvements would change the aesthetics and improve the connections to the (four) cities” said City Engineer Holly Donoghue. “I think it is a really great opportunity … where we are connecting across Woodward.”

In Royal Oak the four lanes of 11 Mile Road would likely be reduced to three lanes in many areas and a left-turn lane would be added.

The city already has an 11 Mile Road repaving project set to go in 2025 from Main Street to Campbell Road that work would include traffic lane reductions.

“That’s where we are seeing the accidents now” Donoghue said.

However Royal Oak would have to maintain four full lanes of traffic at the 11 Mile and Woodward intersection she added.

A city traffic study showed that between 2016 to 2020 there were 568 crashes on 11 Mile in Royal Oak with 149 of them resulting in serious injuries.

Royal Oak’s $1.8 million city repaving of 11 Mile is scheduled to take construction through 2028. The work would be done in three segments. From Main to Campbell Woodward to Main and Campbell to Stephenson.

If approved the city would have to put up a $36000 matching grant but would get a total of roughly $186000 to cover some of the costs for streetscape and other related changes.

Even though there would be lane reductions along parts of 11 Mile a traffic study showed that it would increase a motorist’s trip from Woodward to Stephenson by about one minute Donoghue said.

Other cities are also looking at adding pedestrian islands where the roadway runs through their communities Brake said.

Some residents spoke in support of converting 11 Mile Road to a more pedestrian friendly traffic corridor.

Former City Commissioner Jim Rasor an attorney who transformed a former motel into the boutique Hotel Royal Oak at 811 E. 11 Mile Road said he and other business owners in the area favor slowing motor traffic in the area.

“Those cars are going through there at 50 mph” Rasor said. “We urge you to adopt this (lane reduction now).”

Some city commissioners wondered if Royal Oak could start doing some of the road diet now.

But Donoghue citing the multiple moving parts and schedules for the city’s 11 Mile Road resurfacing disagreed.

“I wouldn’t look at doing a rush project” she said.

The schedule is to repave 11 Mile from Main Street to Campbell in 2025; from Campbell to Stephenson in 2027; and from Woodward to Main in 2028.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2VtaWx5LWhlbnJ5cy1wZW9wbGUtd2UtbWVldC1vbi12YWNhdGlvbi1hZGFwdGF0aW9uLXRvLWJlLWRpcmVjdGVkLWJ5LWJyZXR0LWhhbGV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emily Henry’s ‘People We Meet on Vacation’ Adaptation to Be Directed by Brett Haley,"Best-selling author Emily Henry’s book “People We Meet on Vacation” movie adaptation has recruited Brett Haley as its director and Yulin Kuang to adapt the screenplay TheWrap has learned.

Haley was previously best known for writing and directing “Hearts Beat Loud” starring Nick Offerman Kiersey Clemons Ted Danson Sasha Lane Blythe Danner and Toni Collette. His other credits include “The Hero” which premiered at Sundance in competition in 2017 “All The Bright Places” starring Elle Fanning and “All Together Now” which was also recently released on Netflix. Haley has also directed an episode for the Hulu limited series Looking For Alaska based on the award-winning novel of the same name.

Deadline first reported the news.

Published in 2021 by Berkley Books an imprint of Penguin Random House the novel debuted on the New York Times bestseller list spending over a year on the paperback list. The story follows college best friends Alex and Poppy to very different people who vow to take a yearly vacation somewhere every summer.

Henry who most recently published “Book Lovers” and who has a continuing book contract with Berkley Books for at least three more novels after her latest announced “Happy Place” posted Deadline’s piece to her Instagram.

She also later announced the news in her substack newsletter “Emily’s Grocery List” the edition titled “About Time I Told You Some News.”

“People We Meet on Vacation” is (very likely) going to be a movie!” Henry wrote in her newsletter. “I say ‘very likely’ because films are made up of a million moving parts and there’s a saying among authors to not get your hopes up for an adaptation to pan out until you’re actually sitting at the premiere.”

She also announced Haley’s and Kuang’s boarding of the project.

“We have our script” she wrote. “And I love it so much that when I finished reading and set it aside I just started weeping. I felt seen in the exact way that Alex’s story made Poppy feel seen.”

Temple Hill’s Marty Bowen Wyck Godfrey and Isaac Klausner will produce. Laura Quicksilver is overseeing for the company. Erin Siminoff and Sophie Kaplan are overseeing the project for the studio.

Haley is repped by WME manager Jeff Silver at Grandview and attorneys Scott Whitehead and Jeff Frankel. Kuang is represented by UTA Kaplan/Perrone and attorney Phillip Klein.

Family Fiance Bora Does anyone in your family work in politics or government? N/A Age

45 Previous public office appointive or elective N/A Why are you seeking this office? To protect the American Dream from radicals like Rashida Tlaib.



What are the major differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post? I will fund our police my opponent wants to defund our police. I support Israel my opponent has been called an antisemite even by Democrat leaders for her remarks regarding Israel. I will secure our Southern border and stop illegal immigration my opponent has advocated for defunding our border patrol. I believe in America and capitalism my opponent is a radical Socialist who degrades America and is a cheerleader for Marxists policies.



If you are challenging an incumbent in what way has the current officeholder failed the community?

Rashida Tlaib has focused on radical Socialist policies which have made our community less safe created a crisis on our Southern border caused high inflation increased gas prices and harmed small businesses. Do you think the federal government can or should do more to curb inflation which has led to an increase in prices for food gas and other goods? Yes the federal government needs to slow down spending and decrease our debt. We also need to invest in American oil and gas to lower fuel prices. Do you support changing the state’s constitution to ensure that women have to right to get an abortion? I do not think Abortion is an issue for the Constitution. It is an issue for the legislature and Governor to handle.

Do you support the Raise the Wage ballot initiative which would increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2027 and provide cost-of-living increases in later years? I think minimum wage increases create more inflation harming the very people it is intended to help. It also encourages businesses to hire fewer people again harming the very people it is intended to help. Sounds nice but fails to achieve the goals implied. Would you support an election initiative to require another audit of the 2020 presidential election to transfer authority over the audit from the Secretary of State to a newly created auditing panel and to change how elections are reviewed in the future? I think all elections should be thoroughly reviewed by an independent body to eliminate fraud and improve voter confidence.



What other issues do you intend to address during your campaign? Safer Streets.

Better Schools.

Lower Taxes.

More Freedom.

What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job? I am a Veteran of the United States Marine Corps and small business owner What is the best advice anyone ever gave you? Lead with a servants heart Is there anything else you would like voters to know about yourself and your positions?

I love this great nation and our state."

October 11 2022 - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

WBA has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 45% stake for approximately $392 million which is based on the exit multiple agreed to at the time of WBA's initial majority investment announcement in CareCentrix.

CareCentrix is an industry leader in the $75 billion post-acute and home care industry providing care coordination and outsourced benefit management services. WBA’s full acquisition of CareCentrix follows WBA’s 55% majority investment in the company which closed on August 31 2022. The full acquisition is subject to limited customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 2023.

“We continue to see strong results and potential for growth from our partnership with CareCentrix. Our full acquisition further accelerates our transformation to become a consumer-centric healthcare company leveraging innovative platforms that extend our capabilities into fast-growing segments of healthcare” said Roz Brewer CEO WBA. “CareCentrix is key to offering services to our patients at every stage of the care continuum and to driving long-term sustainable growth as part of our U.S. Healthcare strategy.”

CareCentrix currently manages care for more than 19 million members through over 7400 provider locations offering a suite of services on an integrated basis to support home care models – including home nursing durable medical equipment home infusion and in-home palliative care. By helping to accelerate the transition of care to patients’ homes CareCentrix provides one of the core elements to support value-based care on behalf of health plans and providers.

In WBA’s fiscal year 2021 CareCentrix delivered pro forma sales of $1.5 billion. The company will continue as a distinct business and brand within Walgreens following the full acquisition.

“We are thrilled to be part of WBA’s vision to transform local healthcare and develop new valued-based models” said John Driscoll CEO CareCentrix. “A major component of the future of healthcare is in the home and CareCentrix is critical to enabling WBA to serve patients wherever and however works best for them.”

He will report directly to Brewer and serve on WBA’s executive committee. CareCentrix Chief Financial Officer Steve Horowitz will assume the role of CareCentrix CEO.

“John brings a wealth of experience and leadership across many different aspects of healthcare all of which will play an important role in delivering on our vision to reimagine local healthcare for all” Brewer said. “He has demonstrated high levels of success by building winning teams and rapidly scaling technology-enabled solutions and analytics that make healthcare more personal and effective.”

Driscoll will oversee U.S. Healthcare for WBA as the company expands into larger faster-growing profit pools that drive synergies across the care continuum including provider enablement and managed service organizations primary care population health home health post-acute care specialty pharmacy and retail pharmacy. U.S. Healthcare encompasses integrations with WBA’s market-leading healthcare partners including VillageMD Shields Health Solutions and CareCentrix as well as the organic Walgreens Health business which focuses on population health through initiatives such as Walgreens Health Corners.

“It is an honor to take this leadership position with a company committed to integrating the key pieces to deliver better healthcare at lower costs to so many” Driscoll said. “I look forward to working closely with Roz and WBA’s U.S. Healthcare leadership team to create a truly differentiated experience for consumers across their healthcare journey while bringing greater value to payors providers and other partners.”

October 11 — Today Walmart is announcing the launch of the Walmart Healthcare Research Institute SM (WHRI) to increase community access to healthcare research that may help lead to safer higher quality and more equitable healthcare.

WHRI will be focused on innovative interventions and medications that can make a difference in underrepresented communities including older adults rural residents women and minority populations. WHRI initially is focused on inclusion in studies on treatments for chronic conditions and innovative treatments that should include members from these communities.

“At Walmart we want to help ensure all our customers have access to high quality affordable and convenient healthcare resources including innovative research” said Dr. John Wigneswaran Walmart’s Chief Medical Officer. “We know our customers are interested in participating in healthcare research but many have not had access until now. We are already making an impact for our customers and for medical research by raising patient trust and engagement in their care.”

For decades clinical trials have not been representative of the population at large and often recruit participants who live near research centers have the time and have the financial ability to participate.1 According to Food and Drug Administration data in 2020 75% of trial participants were white 11% were Hispanic 8% were Black and 6% were Asian.2 Walmart is focused on studies that can have a health equity impact in the communities it serves and represent all populations. With 90% of Americans living within 10 miles of a Walmart the retailer can offer solutions to care by meeting customers and patients where they live and work.

Walmart is working with a wide range of study partners including clinical research organizations pharmaceutical companies and leading academic medical centers including CTI Clinical Trial & Consulting Services and Laina Enterprises. WHRI is already demonstrating strong results with a referral rate 3x the industry benchmark.

“The efforts by Walmart in research are innovative and impactful – it is clear that the intention behind their foray into this space is to genuinely make a difference for patients of all ages race and gender in their ability to access research” said Bill Hawkins Chairman of the Board Duke University Health. “This initiative will support individual patient health as well as the health of numerous communities home to Walmart stores.”

To help make it easier for research patients to simplify their care Walmart launched MyHealthJourneySM a digital tool that lets patients take control of their own data through easy access to their eligible medical records and insurance information online in one place. With MyHealthJourneySM patients receive reminders for care services and research opportunities to help them keep their health on track.

“Walmart's research initiative aligns with North Carolina A&T's strategic plans to further expand its local regional and national community engagement activities in order to reduce social economic and health disparities within African American populations” said Dr. Raymond Samuel Professor North Carolina A&T State University; Center of Outreach in Alzheimer’s Aging and Community Health; Past Project Director Hampton University-based Minority Men’s Health Initiative (MMHI). “Walmart's interest in ensuring that DEIA is at the core of its effort to increase customer access to clinical trials is in synergy with the historical commitment of NC A&T to enhancing the well-being of its communities.”

Walmart’s Healthcare Research Institute is an extension of Walmart’s long-standing commitment to helping expand access to patients and underrepresented populations. The retailer has demonstrated this through low-cost medicines such as $4 generic medication program and private label ReliOn® insulin high-quality healthcare at Walmart Health Centers and Vision Centers partnerships and programs to address Social Determinants of Health and now the opportunity to enroll in healthcare research.

“Identifying models that can make shopping easy convenient affordable and sustainable is a core part of how we pursue our commitment to becoming a regenerative business at Walmart. By leaning into reuse with Loop and so many of our brand partners we see a unique opportunity to help our customers eliminate packaging and single use plastic from many of their regular purchases” says Corey Bender VP merchandising for Household Essentials Walmart U.S.

The new Loop assortment includes a combination of well-known food and household products from a range of brands including Gillette Clorox Cascade Kraft Heinz Seventh Generation and Love Beauty and Planet with more brands being added to the Loop product portfolio in the coming months.

Walmart+ InHome allows customers to have fresh groceries everyday essentials and more delivered to the location of their choice: from dropped off at their doorstop to unpacked directly into their kitchen or garage refrigerators all done by highly trained Walmart associates. For customers looking to try out this ultra-convenient and highly personalized service—all while enjoying the added benefit of Loop—they can visit www.inhome.walmart.com to sign up for a 30-day free trial today.

Loop is one of the first platforms to partner with brands and retailers to offer consumers a way to go from single-use packaging to one that is reusable. After consumers use the products they place the empty containers in a designated spot inside or outside their home for a Walmart associate to retrieve them. From there the containers are sent to Loop to be sanitized then returned to participating brands to be refilled and returned to the store for future purchase.

""Loop was designed from the ground-up to reinvent the way we consume by learning from historic circular and sustainable models while honoring the convenience afforded by our single-use consumption of today” says Tom Szaky founder and CEO of Loop and TerraCycle. “Walmart and Loop have come together to create a simple and convenient way to enjoy a wide range of products customized in brand-specific reusable packaging with the convenience of in-home delivery.”

The Walmart Healthcare Research Institute will initially focus on driving greater equity in clinical trials for drugs that treat chronic conditions. Older adults women minorities and rural populations are often underrepresented in such trials though chronic illnesses commonly impact all of these populations. Data from the Food and Drug Administration show that in 2020 75% of trial participants were white while 11% were Hispanic 8% were Black and 6% were Asian Walmart noted in its announcement.

Walmart said it is working with a range of partners including clinical research organizations drugmakers and academic medical centers. The company said that because its reach is significant—90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store—it can use its community ties to meet more diverse potential trial populations where they are.

“At Walmart we want to help ensure all our customers have access to high quality affordable and convenient healthcare resources including innovative research” said John Wigneswaran M.D. Walmart’s chief medical officer in the release.

“We know our customers are interested in participating in healthcare research but many have not had access until now"" Wigneswaran added. ""We are already making an impact for our customers and for medical research by raising patient trust and engagement in their care.”

To make the process simple patients can connect to Walmart's MyHealthJourney app which enables them to track their own health data and insurance information in one place. Walmart said the app will notify users of care services and research opportunities they can use to better manage their own health.

Walmart said it sees the research institute as an extension of its broader focus on healthcare access and affordability. The company has also launched a low-cost private label insulin developed a $4 generic medication program and offers multiple services at cash-pay prices at its growing footprint of clinics.

While probably best known to television audiences as Jessica Fletcher in the long-running detective series Murder She Wrote her performances in two classic Disney films—Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) and Beauty and the Beast (1991)—endeared her to fans of all ages across several generations.

Already an accomplished and Oscar®-nominated dramatic actress and a Tony Award®-winning stage star Angela took her first musical-comedy film role as the apprentice witch Eglantine Price in Bedknobs and Broomsticks introducing several original songs by Disney Legends Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.

She returned to Disney two decades later to voice Mrs. Potts the enchanted teapot in the animated classic Beauty and the Beast this time debuting the enduring title song by Disney Legends Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. Her warm authoritative performance captured the hearts of viewers and critics alike. When the movie was released in 1991 film critic Leonard Maltin called Angela’s performance “just charming.” He continued “She expresses such warmth. To convey that with just your voice… there’s something tremendously appealing about the character and the way she plays it.”

Angela went on to voice Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997) as well as in the video game Kingdom Hearts II (2006). Angela later served as a segment host for the Studio’s millennial animated classic Fantasia 2000 (2000) introducing Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite and she narrated the Beauty and the Beast Sing-Along for the attraction at EPCOT.

Her final Disney performance was in Mary Poppins Returns (2018) portraying the unnamed Balloon Lady who facilitates the magic of the movie’s final scene and leads off the musical number “Nowhere to Go But Up.”

Born in London England on October 16 1925 Angela began to study acting at the Webber-Douglas School of Dramatic Art until World War II forced her family to escape the London Blitz and emigrate to the United States.

In New York she enrolled in the Feagin School of Dramatic Arts and at 16 earned her first professional job performing in a Montreal cabaret act. Her family relocated to Los Angeles and in 1944 director George Cukor cast the 17-year-old actress as the Cockney maid in Gaslight. The role not only won her a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but also an Academy Award® nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

A year later Angela received a second Oscar nomination for her performance as a music-hall singer in The Picture of Dorian Gray. From there she went on to make more than 40 films including The Harvey Girls (1946) with Judy Garland State of the Union (1948) with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) for which she received her third Oscar nomination. She even played Elvis’ mother in 1961’s Blue Hawaii.

In 1966 Angela won the first of her five Tony Awards for her performance as Mame Dennis in the hit musical Mame. She dazzled Broadway audiences with her interpretation of the madcap title role displaying for the first time the full range of her extraordinary talents. Subsequent Tony wins came for Dear World (1969) Gypsy (1975) Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979) and Blythe Spirit (2009). She was given a Lifetime Achievement Tony Award in 2022.

For her first Disney role Angela lobbied producer and co-writer Bill Walsh for the lead in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. She wrote in a hand-written note in October 1969 “I think the script has so many marvelous facets character humor heart and an opportunity for rare inventiveness in so many areas… And the songs Dick and Bob [Sherman] have written for Eglantine are charming and just what was needed. So all things being equal do hope I’m ‘Your Girl.’”

One reason the story appealed to her she later said was because its World War II setting reflected her own experience. “The story reminded me of my teens” Angela recalled. “Like Miss Price I was in England when World War II broke out. My mother gave me a choice of being evacuated from London to a boarding school in the country or studying acting at home. I chose the latter without hesitation.”

Before she would return to Disney storytelling Angela found new fame and accolades in her smash-hit television series Murder She Wrote (1984–1996) receiving 12 successive Emmy® Award nominations.

For Beauty and the Beast Angela’s musical theater bona fides appealed to Disney producer Don Hahn and he was happy to combine her with other stage veterans including Jerry Orbach (Lumiere) and David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth). “We were developing a trio of talking objects in Beauty and the Beast servants who had fallen under the Beast’s spell” Hahn recalls for this article. “They were his confidants in the same way that the Scarecrow Cowardly Lion and Tin Man are to Dorothy in Oz. One of the trio was a maternal teapot named Mrs. Chamomile—which was hard to pronounce so she became Mrs. Potts. For months the casting list had just one name on it: Angela Lansbury. Howard and Alan wrote the ‘Beauty and the Beast’ ballad with her in mind and she recorded it with a live orchestra her voice tinged with melancholy in just one take. She’d tell us later how she’d be talking to a friend and some little kid would run up and say ‘Mom that’s Mrs. Potts!’ She was so proud of being part of it.”

Beauty and the Beast star Disney Legend Paige O’Hara (voice of Belle) offered her own memory for this article: “When I was starting out in New York I used to [sneak into the] second act [of] Angela’s production of Gypsy—I was so in awe of her! And idolized her ever since. That I had the opportunity to work with her and call her my friend was and is a blessing. I am heartbroken and will miss her—but also will always cherish the gifts she so willingly shared with the world. Certain as the sun rising in the east—‘Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme’—I love you Angela! Rest in peace.”

Angela was named a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2014 when she was 88 recognizing her services to both drama and charity.

Angela’s achievements on stage screen and television are too numerous to count but include six Golden Globe® Awards and 18 Primetime Emmy nominations. She is also the recipient of the National Medal of the Arts and the Kennedy Center Honors and she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994. Angela was inducted as Disney Legend in 1995 alongside Wally Boag Fulton Burley Dean Jones Edward Meck Fred Moore Thurl Ravenscroft Wathel Rogers and Betty Taylor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpdG4yMi5vcmcvMjAyMi8xMC8xMC9oYmN1LXdlZWstYXQtd2FsdC1kaXNuZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HBCU Week at Walt Disney,"HBCU Week at Walt Disney

Each marching band showcased all the elements that make an HBCU band so unique – precision marching mechanics high-energy dance teams regal drum majors and the unmistakable sounds of chart-topping R&B music.

Then on Sunday the same marching bands put on a high-steeping show during HBCU Week Battle of the Bands at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.

It was a friendly but fierce battle of the band’s event that included an exciting pre-show performance from none other than Drum Major Mickey Mouse who dazzled the crowd with his moves.

The parade of bands at Magic Kingdom Park and Battle of the Bands at the sports complex was a part of HBCU Week at Walt Disney World. The event featured a host of activities designed to promote HBCU enrollment including a huge college fair offering on-the-spot acceptance and millions in scholarships.

HBCU Week was held for the first time in its five-year history at Walt Disney World in collaboration with the HBCU Foundation Walt Disney World and Disney on the Yard an initiative focused on deepening Disney’s engagement with HBCUs.

(Photo by Santiago Felipe/Getty Images)

Abigail Disney a grandniece of Walt Disney and shareholder in the media giant went viral back in 2019 when she criticized former CEO Bob Iger's $66 million compensation package. Ever since the Disney heiress — who is a documentary filmmaker and social activist — has used her connection with the company to make the case for broader changes in corporate America related to the pay fairness issue and to redefine success in a corporate context.

""How can you call a company successful when people are suffering?"" Disney recently told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the ESG Impact virtual summit. ""Part of the problem of this is in how we define the idea of what a successful company is and if we pushed human interest to the center of our set of calculations about the well-being of a company we would feel very differently about Disney as a successful company.""

Disney who recently released the documentary ""The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales"" said she thinks of ESG as one aspect of a much larger set of principles that determine how a company operates and determine what it can and cannot do.

""It's also a question of helping companies do the right thing"" Disney said.

Worker issues are in fact the No. 1 ESG theme according to polling of the American public. The polling finds that paying a fair and living wage is the single-most important issue for Americans when asked what they want to see companies do.

Disney doesn't buy the argument that the market dictates wages. ""The market is a bit of a yardstick but it's not really dictating anything"" she said. ""These are boards of directors that are populated by people who are CEOs or would like some day to be CEOs and are loyal to the class ... they identify with the CEO"" she said.

A Disney spokesman said in an emailed statement to CNBC ""Our amazing Cast Members storytellers and employees are the heart and soul of Disney and their wellbeing is our top priority."" The Disney spokesman cited ""competitive pay and leading entry wages"" affordable medical coverage access to tuition-free higher education and subsidized child care for eligible employees.

Just Capital the ESG research nonprofit that produces the polling of the American public on corporate issues of importance ranks Disney No. 1 among media companies overall in its annual ranking of the top 100 companies but its lowest category score is workers where Disney ranks 10th among 15 media companies.

In March Disney shareholders voted in favor of a proposal for greater transparency on pay data including data related to race and gender a rare loss for Disney management in a proxy battle which garnered support from 60% of stockholders. According to a June article from entertainment publication The Wrap Abigail Disney is gearing up for another shareholder fight next year against the pay of current Disney CEO Bob Chapek whose compensation doubled last year to $32.5 million.

Disney who told the FT in 2019 that she had a net worth of $120 million and called herself a ""traitor"" to her class doesn't think that the idea of wealth redistribution is necessary.

""I don't think we need to do redistribution. But I think we need to think more carefully about pre-distribution and maybe businesses need to be taking less as owners and seeing the workers as their true partners who deserve to participate in profits just as deeply"" she said. ""Capitalism is the invisible hand that creates a kind of magical surplus when it's worked right. And it can still do that without being this you know predatory entity that it has become"" she added.

Netflix is well-known as one of the pioneers of mass-market video streaming. The service has become so ubiquitous that the word “Netflix” is now synonymous with watching a movie or television show.

But while it’s one of the most recognized streaming platforms in the world has it been able to maintain its dominant position in the industry now that more competitors have entered the fray?

This graphic by Truman Du shows how Disney’s streaming empire (Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+) has quickly gained subscribers and is giving Netflix a run for its money.

Netflix: The Beginning

Founded in 1997 Netflix started out as mail-order DVD rental company. One of the co-founders Reed Hastings told Fortune Magazine that he got the idea for Netflix after he was charged a $40 late fee for a VHS he’d rented out.

By 2007 Netflix had evolved from a relatively modest DVD rental company into a ground-breaking subscription-based streaming service. While there were a few other streaming platforms at the time Netflix had a significant first mover’s advantage operating on a subscription model and acquiring a wide pool of distribution rights from different studios.

This allowed the company to grow rapidly and establish itself as an industry leader. From 2007 to 2022 Netflix’s subscriber base grew from 7 million to 221 million nearly 3000%.

When Did Disney Enter the Scene?

The Walt Disney Company got involved in the streaming industry in 2009 when it first joined Hulu as a minor stakeholder but became more directly invested in 2016 when it bought a 33% stake in BAMTECH Media a video streaming technology company.

Disney eventually bought a majority stake in BAMTECH Media and in 2018 the company rebranded to Disney Streaming Services. In addition to launching Disney+ and ESPN+ Disney’s acquisition of 21 Century Fox gave the company a majority stake in other streaming platforms including Hulu and Star+.

While Disney arrived much later on the scene compared to Netflix it didn’t take long for Disney’s platforms to gain traction. And as of Q2 2022 Disney’s streaming empire (Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+) has more combined subscribers than Netflix and are gaining at a rapid pace.

Netflix



Platform Subscribers (Q2 2022) % Growth (y-o-y) Netflix 220.7 million 5.5% Netflix Total 220.7 million 5.5%

Disney



Platform Subscribers (Q2 2022) % Growth (y-o-y) Disney+ 152.1 million 31.1% Hulu 46.2 million 7.9% ESPN 22.8 million 53.0% Disney Total 221.1 million 27.3%

Other streaming services like HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video also continue to pick up steam which begs the question: has the Netflix empire started to tumble?

Recent Trouble With Netflix

In April 2022 Netflix shared its Q1 results which showed a loss of 200000 subscribers. Though barely a fraction of its 200+ million subscribers it was Netflix’s first drop in subscribers in over 10 years.

This sent the company’s share price plummeting below $200 the lowest since 2017. As October 10 2022 its share price still sits at $230 over 30% down from before the Q1 announcement in April 2022.

But change for the company is on the horizon. Netflix has announced that it plans to launch a cheaper ad-supported service in November—something that other streaming platforms like Peacock and Paramount+ have already been offering customers for a few years."

Discovery Braces For New Round Of Layoffs This Week,"Another wave of Warner Bros Discovery post-merger layoffs is coming.

We hear multiple divisions of the merged company will be impacted with Warner Bros. Television Group considered a main target. The staff reductions are expected this week as soon as (and likely) Tuesday. Speculation about the imminent downsizing started spreading like wildfire Monday morning. Reps for WBD and WBTVG declined comment.

The number of layoffs is unclear but appears to be substantial. The HBO/HBO Max programming operation in August laid off 14% of staff — about 70 people — the vast majority of them on the Max side with the areas of Max Non-Fiction Originals International Acquisitions Casting and Live-Action Family Originals as the most heavily impacted.

Like with HBO/HBO Max the WBTVG cuts are expected to be accompanied by structural changes spearheaded by Chairman Channing Dungey.

A new round of WBD layoffs was expected in the fall as the goal has been for the cuts to be over before the start of the holiday season so this is not a surprise.

“Everyone was given financial targets going into Q4” a corporate insider told Deadline. “Those targets include head counts and October was always the expectation for the ax to fall.”

Content-wise the most significant overlap between Discovery and WarnerMedia is in the unscripted TV area so potential further cuts beyond the HBO Max layoffs had been rumored. WBD’s unscripted studio business part of Warner Bros. TV Group is run by Mike Darnell who has been President of Warner Bros. Unscripted and Alternative Television since he joined in 2013. We hear the veteran reality executive likely will stay put at the studio which operates three businesses that could undergo some sort of consolidation Warner Horizon Unscripted Television Telepictures and Shed Media. (The Discovery side essentially doesn’t have a production side other than its ownership stake in British production group All3Media. Discovery Studios was closed a few years ago with former chief Sandy Varo Jarrell now running All3Media label Bright Spot.)

Brooke Karzen head of development and programming for Warner Horizon Unscripted Television which makes shows such as The Bachelor just stepped down and is leaving the company. David McGuire leads current programming and oversees development at Telepictures with Lisa Shannon and Dan Peirson running development and programming at Shed Media.

Other areas rumored to potentially be affected include TV animation following HBO Max’s recent decision to cut back on the genre triggering the cancellation of several of Warner Bros.-produced series. On the live-action side Warner Bros. TV is preparing for the impact of the CW changing ownership which is expected to significantly reduce the studio’s output for the network.

Beyond WBTVG WBD Streaming Marketing and broader IT operations are rumored to be affected.

The most recent major layoffs to hit Warner Bros.’ production divisions came in 2020 when 600 employees at then-AT&T-owned WarnerMedia were impacted a significant portion of them at Warner Bros Entertainment. Along with the cuts Warner Bros. Television and Warner Horizon Scripted TV were combined. There was also consolidation on the unscripted side under Darnell resulting in a number of layoffs. This all happened before Dungey took over Warner Bros. Television Group as Chairman succeeding Peter Roth. The studio is coming off big Emmy wins for Ted Lasso and Abbott Elementary.

Warner Bros.’ movie studio also has new heads in Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy. Word is that theatrical distribution and marketing would not be significantly impacted; the studio has 14 theatrical releases next year.

The pending layoffs are part of WBD leadership’s pledge to find at least $3 billion in savings. The process started with several high-profile executive departures led by WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar and like Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff in the first three months after the Discovery-WarnerMedia merger was completed.

Dominic Patten and Anthony D’Alessandro contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC93YXJuZXItYnJvcy10ZWxldmlzaW9uLWdyb3VwLWxheW9mZnMtMTI1LWVtcGxveWVlcy0xMjM0NzcxNjM0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Warner Bros. Discovery Layoffs as Warner Bros. Television Group Cuts 125 Jobs,"Warner Bros. Television Group has eliminated 125 jobs IndieWire has learned. That tally includes 82 employees laid off across the scripted unscripted and animation divisions as well as 43 open positions that will go unfilled.

The 125 jobs represent a loss of 26 percent of the current and vacant positions at the company. The layoffs alone comprise 19 percent of the current WBTV workforce.

Parent corporation Warner Bros. Discovery has been cutting costs in all sorts of ways including previous rounds of layoffs and the scrubbing of completed films and television series. The most notable example of the content write offs came when David Zaslav chose to wholly delete “Batgirl” ahead of its release. Zaslav and his consigliere CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels have tasked themselves with finding $3 billion in cost savings.

Tuesday was Warner Bros. TV’s turn to take one for the team (that team being the shareholders). Among those laid off today were both newer employees and others with more than a decade of service to Warner Bros. Television Group we’re told. The highest-profile executive to leave is Brooke Karzen head of Warner Horizon Unscripted Television; the “Bachelor”-universe boss has been with the company since 2000. Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks will now lead Warner Horizon.

Mike Darnell will continue to oversee Warner Bros. Television Group’s unscripted studios: Warner Horizon Telepictures and Shed Media. David McGuire will continue to lead Telepictures; Lisa Shannon and Dan Peirson will continue to run Shed Media. Creative development and programming teams at Warner Horizon and Telepictures are being combined although their labels will remain separate to continue the separation of union (Warner Horizon) and non-union (Telepictures) programming. The physical production business affairs and finance teams for unscripted programming were already combined in a 2020 reorg.

In addition to “The Bachelor” and its many spinoffs Warner Horizon produces “The Voice” for NBC. Telepictures recently launched Jennifer Hudson’s syndicated daytime talk show. Shed Media is probably best known for “The Real Housewives of New York.”

Brett Paul will continue to run Warner Bros. TV’s scripted side which is not seeing a major structural change but will close two key initiatives: Stage 13 and the Warner Bros. Television Workshop. Founded in 2017 the Stage 13 studio was formed to create original short-form programming for digital platforms which Warner Bros. believed could be the future of entertainment content. They were sort of right — but executives had missed the part where it would all be user-generated and free on platforms like Tik Tok. Stage 13 which produced “Two Sentence Horror Stories” for The CW has a few projects still in development; those will shift to the scripted group.

The Warner Bros. Television Workshop for emerging writers and directors will wrap with the 2022-23 class. The workshops were key to discovering and cultivating talent from underrepresented groups a mission the studios and leadership say it plans to continue.

Finally Sam Register will continue to oversee animation from Warner Bros. Animation Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios will combine their development and main production teams. Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe will continue operating largely on its own due to geography and the varying business practices in the different locations. Cartoon Network Studios does the original artist-driven animation; Warner Bros. Animation is the Bugs Bunny and other IP.

Warner Bros. Television Group chief Channing Dungey informed her staff of the layoffs and restructuring today. IndieWire has obtained the email she sent to staff below.

Team

Today I write to you with sad news and a heavy heart. As many of you have already learned some of our treasured colleagues will be leaving the company because of restructuring and realignment within our group. This was strictly a business decision made as thoughtfully and compassionately as possible by studio leadership. But understanding that doesn’t make this moment any easier. These colleagues are more than just people with whom we’ve worked they are part of our work family. We spend more time together than we do with most other people in our lives. Because of that this loss is painful and difficult. For those impacted by the changes I want you to know how grateful I am for your contributions – in some cases spanning decades – and how deeply sorry I am.

There are a few changes happening within WBTVG that I would like to make specific note of here:

As part of the strategic realignment on the unscripted side run by Mike Darnell President Warner Bros. Unscripted Television we are making some changes aimed at finding synergies within the group which includes Warner Horizon Unscripted Television Telepictures and Shed Media.

As you may have read yesterday Brooke Karzen head of Warner Horizon Unscripted Television informed us in the last few weeks that she would like to try something new with her career after a highly successful 22-year run at the company. Brooke has been synonymous with “The Bachelor” brand for more than 20 years overseeing the original show and developing “The Bachelorette” “Bachelor in Paradise” and many other extensions that have propelled “The Bachelor” into a global hit franchise. Her other successes include Emmy winner “The Voice” “Ellen’s Game of Games” and the “Friends” and “Harry Potter” reunion specials to name just a few. Please join me in saluting Brooke for her tremendous accomplishments and wishing her the best in the future.

As a result of Brooke’s departure Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks will now be leading Warner Horizon. We are combining some creative development and programming roles to work across both Warner Horizon and Telepictures with David McGuire continuing to lead Telepictures. Lisa Shannon and Dan Peirson will continue to run Shed Media.

Working across all three unscripted divisions Kevin Fortson continues to lead all aspects of physical production (including budgeting scheduling staffing and more) and Matt Matzkin maintains oversight of all business affairs legal and finance for unscripted series.

In Animation run by Sam Register President Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios we are implementing a new streamlined structure in which the development and main production teams will now work across both Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios. The kids and family series development team will be led by Audrey Diehl adult animation development will be led by Peter Girardi and animated longform series development will be led by Sammy Perlmutter with Bobbie Page leading main production. This is an extension of the cross-studio teams that have already been in place for current programming casting legal and business affairs and artist relations. Ed Adams will continue as Executive Vice President and General Manager.

On the scripted side run by Brett Paul President Warner Bros. Television our senior creative leadership team remains in place. Clancy Collins White continues to head up development with Vicki Dummer as head of current programming. Adam Glick continues to serve as head of business affairs Sue Palladino as head of production and Mele Nagler as head of casting.

We will be closing Stage 13 which was founded in 2017 under the former Warner Bros. Digital Networks division as a studio for original digital shortform programming and has produced past series such as “Special” and “It’s Bruno!” for Netflix “Two Sentence Horror Stories” for The CW/Netflix and more. WBTV has already been supervising Stage 13 development and programming since 2020. Any existing Stage 13 projects in development will be absorbed within WBTV which continues to be committed to finding new voices and providing opportunities for its richly diverse creative collaborators to tell authentic stories. I want to thank Diana Mogollón for her passionate leadership of Stage 13 and for the groundbreaking series that she and her team produced.

Also following the conclusion of the current 2022–23 edition of the Warner Bros. Writers’ Workshop in April we will be closing the Warner Bros. Television Workshop program which includes both the Writers’ Workshop and the Directors’ Workshop. Both workshops have been instrumental in training the next generation of creative talent in the industry. While we will no longer have these formalized programs in place we remain committed to developing and mentoring emerging talent and preparing them for careers in television.

As of this writing all the impact conversations for WBTVG are complete. Out of respect to our colleagues we will not be distributing a list of those impacted. Your direct managers will provide you with information about roles changing within specific groups. Your P&C partner will be available as well to address any questions or concerns. During this period of transition please support each other and be gentle with one another.

These are challenging times in the world at large and a tumultuous time in our industry. For this kind of change to hit so close to home is incredibly difficult. But my hope is that these changes made with an eye to a more focused business strategy will strengthen and stabilize our company maintain our great creative output and better position us for continued future success.

Yet today we are losing members of our work family that we love whose hard work has helped make our success possible and for that I am truly sorry. I want everyone who is leaving to know that your contributions mattered and the shows that you helped bring to life will always be part of the Warner Bros. Television Group legacy. Thank you for being part of our story.

With the deepest gratitude

Channing",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS90di90di1uZXdzL21vcmUtbGF5b2Zmcy1jb21pbmctdHVlc2RheS1hdC13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktMTIzNTIzODMzNC_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vdHYvdHYtbmV3cy9tb3JlLWxheW9mZnMtY29taW5nLXR1ZXNkYXktYXQtd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LTEyMzUyMzgzMzQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Layoffs Coming Tuesday at Warner Bros. Discovery,"Another round of layoffs is coming Tuesday at Warner Bros. Discovery.

Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that as part of Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s effort to find $3 billion in post-merger cost savings layoffs will impact several departments in the merged companies. Among those expected to be impacted are Channing Dungey’s Warner Bros. Television Group (which includes scripted unscripted and alternative studios); possibly DC Comics Cartoon Network Adult Swim and other units.

Reps for Warner Bros. Discovery and WBTV declined to comment.

The idea that additional layoffs are coming is not necessarily new information though the Tuesday timing is. A wave of layoffs hit Casey Bloys’ HBO Max and HBO teams in August with an estimated 70 staffers let go as part of a larger restructuring.

All facets of the merged WBD are being examined as Zaslav looks to save billions in staff redundancies and other areas. Sources tell THR that lower-level executives may be the focus of the layoffs at WBTV. Other departments like ad sales are rumored to be looking to cut costs by 20 percent to 30 percent through a combination of layoffs travel and expense savings and supplier cuts.

The Warner Bros. film group is likely not going to be impacted as part of Tuesday’s layoffs as its new executive regime needs time to acclimate.

Additional layoffs at other WBD divisions are expected.

HBO Max and Discovery+ will be merged into one service next year. Executives are currently debating a new name for the service as sources say much of the discussion is about whether the HBO name will remain part of it or if a broader name for the service would work better.

THR will have more details on the cutbacks Tuesday.

TV Group Lays Off 82 Staffers Consolidates Some Unscripted and Animation Departments in Belt-Tightening Restructure,"Warner Bros. Television Group handed out pink slips to 82 staffers on Tuesday representing 19% of the studio’s workforce across its scripted unscripted and animation divisions. Additionally it has opted not to fill 43 additional vacant positions — making for a total elimination of 125 jobs (or 26% of an approximately 481 headcount).

Warner Bros. TV Group declined comment but it’s understood that chairman Channing Dungey detailed to staff a series of changes that included various levels of consolidation in unscripted and animation. Also as reported Tuesday afternoon the company has closed Stage 13 a shingle focused on diverse shortform programming (leading to the exit of Stage 13 head Diana Mogollón) and will end the Warner Bros. Television Workshop which had existed for decades as a training ground for new creative talent in both writing and directing.

The layoffs were expected as the latest cost cutting move inside Warner Bros. Discovery which merged in April and since then has attempted to make good on its mission to cut costs by $3 billion. It also comes just two years after a previous round of layoffs under the WarnerMedia banner had already cut into Warner Bros.’ workforce by at least 650 people.

Popular on Variety

More recently in August WBD eliminated around 70 jobs or 14% of the workforce from HBO and HBO Max as the company prepares to merge HBO Max and Discovery+ into one streamer. Unscripted programming scripted children’s and family fare casting international and acquisitions were hardest hit. And in September WBD let go of 100 employees as part of the downsizing of the company’s ad sales departments.

As outlined on Tuesday Dungey’s direct reports remain as do the umbrella divisions that fall under the Warner Bros. TV Group banner — but more consolidation has occurred.

In the non-fiction space Mike Darnell remains as president of Warner Bros. Unscripted Television and continues to report to Dungey; Warner Horizon Unscripted Television Telepictures and Shed Media will continue as separate shingles under Darnell’s domain.

But with the announcement Monday that Warner Horizon Unscripted TV head Brooke Karzen was departing some creative development and programming oversight will now be combined between Warner Horizon and Telepictures. (Warner Horizon productions fall under union work while Telepictures is generally not under union rules.) With Karzen’s exit Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks will now lead Warner Horizon while David McGuire continues to lead Telepictures and Lisa Shannon and Dan Peirson continue to run Shed Media.

Physical production business affairs and finance teams for unscripted programming had already been consolidated between Warner Horizon Telepictures and Shed Media following the 2020 cuts.

With the Warner Bros. Discovery merger Shed Media is expected to develop and produce more content for the Discovery networks while overall Warner Bros.’ unscripted units will continue to sell to external platforms and create formats for international as well.

In animation Sam Register will continue to oversee Warner Bros. Animation Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. Those three labels will continue to exist but development and main production teams for Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios will now merge (while Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe will maintain a separate team). The three shingles had already shared the same current programming casting legal/business affairs and artist relations teams.

Under the new setup a kids and family series development team will be led by Audrey Diehl adult animation development will be led by Peter Girardi and animated longform series development will be led by Sammy Perlmutter with Bobbie Page leading main production.

Despite the changes output will remain the same as Cartoon Network Studios continues to produce original animated fare for internal outlets including Cartoon Network Adult Swim and HBO Max. And with HBO Max moving away from adult animation there will be a renewed push for producing for third-party networks and outside platforms as well. Warner Bros. Animation focuses on more pre-existing characters and IP.

Also under Dungey’s direct report Warner Bros. TV president Brett Paul continues on the scripted side with no major structural changes beyond the closure of Stage 13 (which comes as the company decides to no longer invest in short-form production). The biggest change to scripted came back in 2020 when Warner Bros. TV and Warner Horizon Scripted TV were merged.

Meanwhile as broadcasters pull back on their number of series and pilots — as it appears more likely that networks may reduce their primetime hours and The CW shifts its focus under new ownership — Warner Bros. TV will likely reduce its roster in terms of writer deals as well.

Nonetheless Warner Bros. TV is still aiming to be a major supplier of programming first for its own sister platforms (the studio has 15 scripted and unscripted series currently with HBO Max plus more than 20 animated shows) in addition to outside entities. Warner Bros. recently scored Emmys for “Ted Lasso” which it produces for Apple TV+ and “Abbott Elementary” which it produces for ABC. Warner Bros.’ scripted unscripted and animated divisions count more than 120 shows in production for more than 20 different platforms.

Here is the memo distributed to staffers this afternoon by Dungey:

Team

Today I write to you with sad news and a heavy heart. As many of you have already learned some of our treasured colleagues will be leaving the company because of restructuring and realignment within our group. This was strictly a business decision made as thoughtfully and compassionately as possible by studio leadership. But understanding that doesn’t make this moment any easier. These colleagues are more than just people with whom we’ve worked they are part of our work family. We spend more time together than we do with most other people in our lives. Because of that this loss is painful and difficult. For those impacted by the changes I want you to know how grateful I am for your contributions – in some cases spanning decades – and how deeply sorry I am.

There are a few changes happening within WBTVG that I would like to make specific note of here:

As part of the strategic realignment on the unscripted side run by Mike Darnell President Warner Bros. Unscripted Television we are making some changes aimed at finding synergies within the group which includes Warner Horizon Unscripted Television Telepictures and Shed Media.

As you may have read yesterday Brooke Karzen head of Warner Horizon Unscripted Television informed us in the last few weeks that she would like to try something new with her career after a highly successful 22-year run at the company. Brooke has been synonymous with The Bachelor brand for more than 20 years overseeing the original show and developing The Bachelorette Bachelor in Paradise and many other extensions that have propelled The Bachelor into a global hit franchise. Her other successes include Emmy winner The Voice Ellen’s Game of Games and the Friends and Harry Potter reunion specials to name just a few. Please join me in saluting Brooke for her tremendous accomplishments and wishing her the best in the future.

As a result of Brooke’s departure Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks will now be leading Warner Horizon. We are combining some creative development and programming roles to work across both Warner Horizon and Telepictures with David McGuire continuing to lead Telepictures. Lisa Shannon and Dan Peirson will continue to run Shed Media.

Working across all three unscripted divisions Kevin Fortson continues to lead all aspects of physical production (including budgeting scheduling staffing and more) and Matt Matzkin maintains oversight of all business affairs legal and finance for unscripted series.

In Animation run by Sam Register President Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios we are implementing a new streamlined structure in which the development and main production teams will now work across both Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios. The kids and family series development team will be led by Audrey Diehl adult animation development will be led by Peter Girardi and animated longform series development will be led by Sammy Perlmutter with Bobbie Page leading main production. This is an extension of the cross-studio teams that have already been in place for current programming casting legal and business affairs and artist relations. Ed Adams will continue as Executive Vice President and General Manager.

On the scripted side run by Brett Paul President Warner Bros. Television our senior creative leadership team remains in place. Clancy Collins White continues to head up development with Vicki Dummer as head of current programming. Adam Glick continues to serve as head of business affairs Sue Palladino as head of production and Mele Nagler as head of casting.

We will be closing Stage 13 which was founded in 2017 under the former Warner Bros. Digital Networks division as a studio for original digital shortform programming and has produced past series such as Special and It’s Bruno! for Netflix Two Sentence Horror Stories for The CW/Netflix and more. WBTV has already been supervising Stage 13 development and programming since 2020. Any existing Stage 13 projects in development will be absorbed within WBTV which continues to be committed to finding new voices and providing opportunities for its richly diverse creative collaborators to tell authentic stories. I want to thank Diana Mogollón for her passionate leadership of Stage 13 and for the groundbreaking series that she and her team produced.

Also following the conclusion of the current 2022–23 edition of the Warner Bros. Writers’ Workshop in April we will be closing the Warner Bros. Television Workshop program which includes both the Writers’ Workshop and the Directors’ Workshop. Both workshops have been instrumental in training the next generation of creative talent in the industry. While we will no longer have these formalized programs in place we remain committed to developing and mentoring emerging talent and preparing them for careers in television.

As of this writing all the impact conversations for WBTVG are complete. Out of respect to our colleagues we will not be distributing a list of those impacted. Your direct managers will provide you with information about roles changing within specific groups. Your P&C partner will be available as well to address any questions or concerns. During this period of transition please support each other and be gentle with one another.

These are challenging times in the world at large and a tumultuous time in our industry. For this kind of change to hit so close to home is incredibly difficult. But my hope is that these changes made with an eye to a more focused business strategy will strengthen and stabilize our company maintain our great creative output and better position us for continued future success.

Yet today we are losing members of our work family that we love whose hard work has helped make our success possible and for that I am truly sorry. I want everyone who is leaving to know that your contributions mattered and the shows that you helped bring to life will always be part of the Warner Bros. Television Group legacy. Thank you for being part of our story.

With the deepest gratitude

Many countries ship plastic waste overseas. How much of the world’s waste is traded and how big is its role in the pollution of our oceans? Cite this article Reuse our work freely

The largest share of plastic that enters the oceans comes from rivers in Asia.1 More than 80% of it.2

Only a small amount comes from rivers across Europe and North America. Together rivers in these regions contribute just 5% to 10% of the global total. This would suggest that the world’s richest countries don’t contribute much to the problem of plastic pollution.

But these numbers only look at the plastic that is emitted domestically. They don’t consider the fact that many countries export plastic waste overseas. If it was the case that the UK exported a lot of its plastic waste to countries where waste management systems are poor and lots of plastic leaks into the environment the UK would have a large indirect impact on ocean pollution.

Here I use global data to understand the scale of plastic waste trade. I look at who the biggest exporters and importers are and where this waste ends up.

I estimate that a few percent – possibly up to 5% – of the world’s ocean plastics could come from rich countries exporting their waste overseas. That could bring the total up to 10%: 5% directly from rivers in these regions plus a further 5% from trade.

How much of the world’s plastic waste is traded?

Importing plastics can often bring economic benefits. Recycled plastics can be repurposed into other goods and fed into manufacturing industries. This is often cheaper than buying or making virgin plastics from scratch.

In 2020 around 5 million tonnes of plastic waste was traded globally.3 We might imagine that the pandemic forced a large reduction in plastic trade but this doesn’t seem to be the case. In 2019 rates were only slightly higher at around 6 million tonnes.

Let’s put those 5 million tonnes into context.

The world generates around 350 million tonnes of plastic waste per year. That means that around 2% of waste is traded.4

The remaining 98% is handled domestically. It’s sent to a landfill recycled or incinerated in the country where the waste was generated. The idea that most of the world’s plastic waste is shipped overseas is incorrect. One reason why this figure is so low is that it’s mostly recycled waste that’s traded and only 20% of the world’s plastic is recycled.5

Over the last decade we’ve seen a large decline in the amount of plastic waste traded. Rates have fallen by two-thirds since 2010.

What was the impact of the Chinese ban on plastic trade?

Policies in China toward plastic trade have had a large impact on the global change shown in the previous chart.

In 2016 China was importing more than half of the world’s traded plastic waste. By 2018 this had plummeted to less than 1%. We see this in the chart.

The reason for this dramatic decline was the Chinese government banning the import of most types of plastic waste in 2017. This was part of a broader policy decision to stop the import of 24 different types of solid waste including paper textiles and plastics. These bans were implemented as a result of environmental and health concerns from contaminated waste streams.

This ban had two major impacts.6 The first was that the total volume of plastic trade globally dropped significantly – we saw earlier that global trade has halved since 2017. The second was that other countries emerged to take China’s place as major importers. Most of them are also countries in Asia – Malaysia Vietnam Indonesia the Philippines and Turkey started to import much more plastic than in previous years.

Most plastic waste is traded within world regions rather than between them

Where does plastic waste flow across the world?

Europe is the region that exports the most plastic but it's also the region that imports the most.

This is true more generally. Most plastic is traded within a given region. European countries export most plastic to other European countries. Asian countries export most to other Asian countries.

In the visualization we see the flow of plastic across the world.7 On the left we have the exporters of plastic waste; on the right we see where that plastic ends up. The height of each bar is proportional to the amount of plastic that is traded.

Europe is the biggest exporter of plastic. But it’s also the biggest importer. Many countries across Europe trade with one another. At the national level Germany is the biggest exporter and importer – it trades different plastics with its neighbors including the Netherlands Poland Austria and Switzerland.8

This is also true of Asia where Japan is the biggest exporter to other countries in Asia.

Do rich countries export most of their plastic waste overseas?

Many people think that rich countries ship most of their plastic waste overseas. But is this really true?

The short answer is no: many countries export some of their waste but they still handle most of it domestically.

Let’s take the example of the UK. In 2010 it generated an estimated 4.93 million tonnes of plastic waste.9 It exported 838000 tonnes overseas.

That means it exported about 17% of its plastic waste. That’s a substantial fraction – nearly one-fifth of it.

This data is for 2010 a year with good high-quality estimates of plastic waste generation. It’s still likely to be a reasonable estimate today. If anything this share might have declined slightly because waste exports have not increased and waste generation probably has.

When it comes to the fraction of plastic waste that is exported the UK is one of the largest exporters. For context the US exported about 5% of its plastic waste in 2010. France exported 11% and the Netherlands exported 14%.

Most rich countries are net exporters of plastic waste. And this can be a significant fraction of their waste. But it’s not the case that they handle most of it by offshoring it to other countries.

How much do rich countries contribute to plastic pollution through their exported waste?

This is the crucial question. While we don’t have an exact answer we can give a plausible range.

To give an exact answer we would need to trace each piece of plastic pollution back to its original source. But we can do some calculations to estimate how much plastic is at higher risk of entering the ocean because of this trade.

In 2020 low-to-middle-income countries – where plastic waste was at a ‘higher risk’ of entering the ocean (because of poorer waste management systems) – imported around 1.6 million tonnes of plastic waste from rich countries. Here ‘rich countries’ include all countries in Europe and North America plus Japan Hong Kong and OECD countries from other regions.10

How much of this plastic ends up in the ocean?

Again we don’t know for sure. But we can run through a worst and best-case scenario.

Here we will assume that all of this traded waste was ‘mismanaged’ meaning it was not formally managed and was either littered or dumped in open landfills. In reality not all of it will be mismanaged but let’s be conservative here.

The probability that mismanaged waste ends up in the ocean varies a lot by country.

The country where the probability is highest is the Phillippines – an estimated 7% ends up in the ocean.11 We could imagine this being our ‘worst-case’ scenario: if rich countries exported all of their plastic trade to the Philippines 7% of it might end up in the ocean. That would be 112000 tonnes.12

In a ‘best-case’ scenario only around 1% of mismanaged waste would end up in the ocean. Most countries across the world have a risk of just under 1%. In Asia this would be typical of countries such as Thailand and Cambodia. In this ‘best-case’ scenario around 16000 tonnes of ocean plastics each year would enter the ocean from trade.13

This gives us an upper and lower bound for the contribution of trade from rich countries. Since around one million tonnes of plastic enters the ocean each year rich countries would contribute between 1.6% (in the best case) and 11% (in the worst case) of ocean plastics through shipping waste overseas.14

The true figure probably falls somewhere in between. A reasonable estimate might be around 5% of ocean plastics. In reality it might be a bit lower because a tonne of waste that is bought and traded is more likely to be managed well than the average tonne of waste in a country.

I estimate that a few percent of ocean plastics could result from trade from rich countries. A figure as high as 5% would not be unreasonable.

Ending plastic trade would only do a bit to reduce plastic pollution – what is needed are better waste-management systems

Stopping exports of plastic waste to countries with poor waste management would help to tackle ocean pollution.

If rich countries banned the export of plastic waste to these countries we might reduce plastic pollution a bit: perhaps up to 5%.

But an end to trade won’t stop plastic pollution. Only a small fraction of the world’s plastic waste is traded – under 2%. And most – two-thirds of it – ends up in richer countries where it’s very unlikely to end up in the ocean.

There are obvious reasons to reduce these exports beyond the plastic pollution problem. Countries have been guilty of exporting contaminated recycling plastic packages – one of the drivers for countries to ban plastic imports. This is unacceptable: poorer countries are not a dumping ground for the rich.

Most of the world’s waste is handled domestically and most of the waste that enters the oceans stems from these countries. To really tackle the problem we need to do two things: scale waste management systems in rich countries; the fact that they are exporting waste overseas suggests they have under-invested in practices at home; and importantly improve waste management infrastructure and practices in low-to-middle-income countries as this is where most plastic pollution originates.

Ala. (WBRC) - Some Shelby County neighbors say they haven’t had their garbage picked up in the last two weeks.

Effective at the beginning of this month the garbage collection service provider changed from Republic Services to Waste Management.

Waste Management said they are sending extra personnel to help during this transition.

Shelby County facility manager Trey Gauntt said some of their drivers were new to the routes and new to the area.

“It has taken them a little while we are a little over a week in now into their contract so it has taken them a bit to learn the route and get familiar with those routes” Gauntt said.

Residents from Columbiana Vincent Highway 49 and Highway 61 are currently without garbage pickup.

Those homeowners told me they received a card notifying them of the change in garbage pickup services however as of today they have not seen a truck.

“We just ask the customers to please be patient with our contractor and allow them to some time to get through this learning curve” Gauntt said.

Gauntt said Waste Management is working to get all caught up by next week.

Keep in mind that recycling services have also been discontinued.

With a loyal millennial consumer base the wearables brand has the wind in its sail to go into rural markets. The challenge is to shore up offline sales.

On January 22 2022 Imagine Marketing Ltd (boAt) an Indian lifestyle brand that made fashionable wearable products announced it was going in for an IPO in April or May 2022. With the proposed IPO boAt was set to become the first D2C start-up in India to come up with an IPO. The company planned to raise ₹2000 crore through the IPO.

Earlier in the first week of January 2021 Warburg Pincus a US-based private equity firm had invested ₹731 crore in boAt. The company planned to invest the amount on improving its manufacturing capacity in India and venturing into the global market.

According to International Data Corporation (IDC) globally in the wearables market boAt occupied the fifth place by volume of shipments and market share in Q1 2022. The first four places were held by Apple Samsung Xiaomi and Huawei respectively.

However in the Indian wearables market boAT had a leadership position. Even though boAt had made it to the top five in the wearables segment globally and was a market leader in India it was facing increased competition from global brands.

Analysts opined that in the future the company would have to focus on its marketing strategy and bring forth innovative products that appeal to the millennials. They added that the market penetration of its products in the rural segment of India was another focus area.

About boAT

boAt is a New Delhi-based company founded by Sameer Mehta and Aman Gupta in 2016. The company was bootstrapped entirely with a funding of ₹30 lakh from its founders. In the initial stages it was a struggle for the founders to raise funds and manufacture products that were affordable as well as fashionable.

In due course boAt received funding from various investors such as Qualcomm Ventures Warburg Pincus InnoVen Capital Navi Technologies and Fireside Ventures.

The launch of affordable fashionable audio products gave a boost to boAt’s popularity and its revenues increased by more than three times to ₹113 crore in FY 2018 up from ₹31 crore in FY 2017. The company’s revenue in FY 2019 was ₹237 crore and in FY 2020 it touched ₹701 crore. In FY 2021 the company posted a revenue of ₹1531 crore.

Initially boAt sold its products through e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Flipkart. Later on it expanded its e-commerce presence to include Croma Myntra and Jabong. As of November 2021 the company sells its products through 5000 retail stores and 20 distributors and has served two crore customers in India.

Marketing strategy

boAT identified a gap in the market came up with innovations focused on quality positioned the product well and paid increased attention to customer requirements. It also went in for celebrity endorsements and online marketing.

White space

The company found that one of the problems people frequently faced was the snapping of mobile charging cables. So this was the first problem that it solved with the introduction of indestructible cables. The company sensed the need of the customers and immediately developed a product that would serve and satisfy them.

Similarly the need for tangle-free cables for wired earphones led to the introduction of braided wire longer cables. As customers were bored with plastic earphones the company introduced metal-based earphones

Innovation rationale

The company consistently worked on developing new products and introducing them in the market to keep ahead of the competition. It found that Indians loved bass in their music and launched earphones called BassHeads. In 2018 it then launched speakers and home audio systems and soundbars the very next year.

Focus on quality

In the market premium quality earphones were costly and unaffordable to the millennials. So the company launched products that were not only durable but were also priced reasonably. Its affordable yet good-quality products enabled the company to compete effectively with competitors such as Sony JBL Samsung and Sennheiser. The affordable prices offered by boAt even led to JBL cutting down on the prices of some of its products.

Product positioning

Aman Gupta (left) and Sameer Mehta Co-Founders boAt

boAt portrayed its products as lifestyle products that were a part of everyday fashion and not as electronic accessories. The products were mainly targeted at millennials who loved trendy affordable and quality products with a premium look.

Attuned to customer needs

boAt’s marketing strategy was to pay increased attention to the requirements of the customer and create a relationship with them. The company named its loyal customers ‘boAtheads’ and had a dedicated community for them. The request for changes in any product and the introduction of new products was done by taking any criticism from these loyal boAthead communities positively. These customer-focused initiatives helped the company’s customer base increase to 20 lakh by 2020 from 8 lakh in 2018.

Celebrity endorsements

Most of the brand ambassadors of boAt were either from Bollywood or cricketers as these were the most popular pastimes of millennials — boAt’s target segment. The brand ambassadors of the company were actors such as Kiara Advani Karthik Aryan and Jacqueline Fernandez while from the cricketing field it was KL Rahul Shikhar Dhawan and Hardik Pandya.

Some famous music personalities such as Diljeet Dosanjh and Neha Kakkar have also been brand ambassadors. Celebrity endorsements helped the company overcome the challenge of creating brand awareness in tier-2cities.

Digital marketing

As most millennials were active on social media and spent most of their time online boAt adopted the online mode to run its marketing campaigns . With a minimal presence on television and print media the company preferred social media campaigns on platforms such as Facebook and others.

Millennial mindset

boAt sold electronic products as fashion accessories and that caught the attention of the millennials. The company also partnered with fashion designers to launch products that catered to the younger generation. Product durability was one of the main reasons for boAt’s success and that combined with the right pricing helped the company clinch its share in a market dominated by foreign brands.

In June 2019 boAt partnered with singer Neha Kakkar to promote its range of audio products. As the company’s audio products were linked to music this was the right move.

Road ahead

The major part of boAt’s business was online and comprised 60 to 70 per cent of its total sales. Most of the offline sales of boAt were from the top ten to 20 cities and the company was keen to focus on the smaller towns and rural markets. The company planned to reach more offline customers through partnerships with retail players such as Croma and Vijay Sales.

The company also had plans to venture into the overseas market and diversify its portfolio to include products that were gaming-based such as keyboards mouses and headphones. With the tendency to purchase earphones along with smartphones showing an upward trend most smartphone companies had tied up with audio companies for combined deals on smartphones and earphones.

Apple had tied up with Beats and Samsung with Harman and JBL. boAt was also on the lookout for a partnership with smartphone manufacturers to promote the sales of its audio devices. In the future it aims to provide Indian customers with audio products with the latest technology so that they would not have to depend on foreign products.

GOING back years the south east has long been regarded as the poor relation in terms of investment and attracting high level jobs. In a region where large scale announcements have been relatively few and far between it was unsurprising that Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment made the journey to Wexford to Waters Technologies as they announced a €6 million expansion of their facilities creating 20 new jobs.

""I’m really pleased to be here in Wexford today at the announcement of a €6 million investment here at Waters Corporation” he said. “It’s very important for the south east. At least 20 new jobs will be generated as a result. It's also partially brought about by a collaboration with the company and the new technological university here in the south east. I see huge potential for further investment both by IDA companies investing here in Wexford and also Enterprise Ireland companies that already employ around 5000 people in the county.

The Tánaiste is not blind to the difficulties the south east region has faced though but he was firm in his assessment that the tide is turning.

""The south east is very much a catch-up region in terms of economic development but it is catching up. I’m here to make sure that we put in place the necessary infrastructure and the necessary government intention to make sure we’ve more investment more jobs and better jobs in the county going forward.”

“I also visited the Technology Park site in Enniscorthy and we’re having conversations with the IDA about developing an IDA site there as well. We’re very keen to see more investment from blue chip companies like Waters in Wexford.

""I think everything is coming together. For that (investment) to happen over the next couple of years we’re seeing investment in roads the national broadband plan the new university; really all the conditions are falling into place for increased investment from multi-nationals but also by Irish companies that want to expand. I’m very optimistic over that for the coming years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS5oay9zZWN0aW9uLW5ld3Mvc2VjdGlvbi8xMS8yNDYyMTYvVVMtd2FybnMtSEstb3Zlci1naXZpbmctaGF2ZW4tdG8tUnVzc2lhbi1zdXBlci15YWNodNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US warns HK over giving haven to Russian super yacht,"Agence France-Presse

and staff reporter

Hong Kong could damage its reputation as a financial hub if it gives haven to sanctions dodgers the United States cautioned after the city said it would not act against a super yacht belonging to an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The Standard broke the news online last Thursday that The Nord - a US$500 million 142-meter luxury vessel linked to Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov - has been anchored in Hong Kong's Western Quarantine and Immigration Anchorage between Stonecutters Island and Tsing Yi since last Wednesday.

The 57-year-old Mordashov is among the oligarchs who are close to Putin and have been targeted by Western sanctions by the US and European Union following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Some have had their luxury yachts seized in places such as Spain and Fiji.

But Hong Kong's Marine Department said last Friday that while it implements United Nations sanctions it cannot enforce those imposed unilaterally by countries or blocs.

The department also has refused to comment on individual cases. In response a US State Department spokesman said: ""The possible use of Hong Kong as a safe haven by individuals evading sanctions from multiple jurisdictions further calls into question the transparency of the business environment.

""Hong Kong's reputation as a financial center depends on adherence to international laws and standards"" he said.

The department's website says all visiting vessels must fill in a three-page form to apply for permission to navigate in the waters of Hong Kong including providing details of a berthing location.

It is understood the department approves applications as long as the vessels comply with all requirements including having appointed a legal agent in the SAR and possessing safety and pollution prevention certificates. Sanctions on a vessel's owner are not among the considerations.

Permission to remain is usually granted on a monthly basis or less but a visiting yacht cannot stay in Hong Kong waters for more than 182 consecutive days.

Almost twice the length of the SAR's sunken landmark Jumbo Floating Restaurant measuring 76 meters the 10154-ton air-conditioned Nord has six stories served by an elevator.

Among its features are a gym swimming pool movie theater spa room and sauna and a beauty salon.

It has also a swimming platform barbecue and beach club facilities plus underwater lighting.

It has two helicopter landing pads - one on the bow and the other on the top deck with a hangar.

It is understood that Mordashov the main shareholder and chairman of Russia's largest steel and mining company Severstal is not on board the Nord.

As the second-wealthiest man in Russia he has an estimated worth of more than US$29.1 billion (HK$226 billion).

The US and the EU have seized a dozen yachts owned by sanctioned Russian businessmen and worth more than US$2.25 billion.

Nord is among the ""lucky ones"" that fled and relocated to ports where sanctions do not apply.

In March Nord remained under the ownership of Mordashov and was registered in the Cayman Islands with a listed value there of US$300 million.

On March 12 the vessel left the Seychelles.

Having topped up with US$465000-worth of fuel and sailing at top speed Nord arrived at Vladivostok on April 11.

The vessel had allegedly turned off its mandatory location responders and sailed the 6701 nautical miles in stealth mode.

The Nord took one more jaunt through the Sea of Japan and called at Busan in South Korea before heading back to Vladivostok where it was recorded as being anchored on June 6 before making its way to Hong Kong."

Even so supply chain constraints and challenges with connecting those projects to the grid may delay their expansion statewide.

Madison-based Alliant Energy recently announced it will spend $354 million to add 175 megawatts of battery storage. The two projects are linked to solar systems being built in Wood and Grant counties. Those projects are part of Alliant’s plans to build 1.1 gigawatts of solar systems approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission last year.

The two battery projects combined could store enough energy to power more than 180000 homes for four hours. And the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will make it easier to build stand-alone projects according to Rick Zimmerman Alliant’s manager of resource development.

The law extended the investment tax credit for solar systems for up to 30 percent of the cost of equipment installations for the next decade. But it also extended that incentive for stand-alone energy storage projects for the first time which previously only applied to storage paired with solar systems.

“It just gives us a greater flexibility of where to site our battery and how we can use it” said Zimmerman.

Alliant’s plans are part of the utility’s Clean Energy Blueprint that’s expected to save customers between $2 billion and $6.5 billion over the next 35 years. The utility plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 as part of the clean energy transition and efforts to combat climate change.

Just five years ago some utility executives remained wary of the effectiveness of battery storage and their costs but that’s changing. A September report by Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association found grid-scale installations of battery storage represented a quarterly record of 1170 megawatts.

“We see a lot more in the approval process right now than we’ve seen in years past” said Zimmerman. “We’re looking at other battery opportunities too.”

However supply chain issues and transportation delays along with challenges tying into the power grid slowed or canceled more than 1.1 gigawatts of projects nationwide in the second quarter of this year.

Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group which owns We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service has announced three battery storage projects with Madison Gas and Electric. Those projects are paired with solar systems at the utilities’ Koshkonong Paris and Darien sites. They would add 350 megawatts of storage but all of them have been delayed due to supply chain issues.

“We have expected in-service dates for the solar portion. But right now we don’t have expected in-service dates for any of the battery portions because of supply chain issues” said Brendan Conway spokesperson for We Energies and WPS.

Despite that the utilities are committed to building the projects. Conway added that WEC Energy Group also plans to announce another 500 megawatts of storage between now and 2026.

“Batteries have been around for a long time…but the cost now finally makes sense” said Conway.

The price for battery packs has been dropping over time. Utilities are also taking another look at their plans and cost estimates based on the new incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act according to Michael Vickerman policy director for RENEW Wisconsin.

“Batteries definitely moved forward in the eyes of utilities” said Vickerman. “(It) became a more attractive option for their generation investments for the next 10 years.”

While the incentives help Alliant’s Zimmerman said policy changes from the regional grid operator are also a driving factor.

The Midwest Independent System Operator that oversees the regional grid is proposing to revise its resource adequacy requirements which ensure there’s enough power to meet demand for electricity. The regional grid operator previously measured the capacity of generation resources like coal natural gas and renewables based on their ability to meet peak demand in the summer.

Now MISO is proposing to set requirements for those resources during each season to ensure there’s enough capacity to deal with emergency events that happen year-round. The change is driven in part by coal plant retirements less solar power during winter months and outages from extreme weather.

“Battery technology becomes particularly important to that solar plant because often the peak period (of power demand) on a winter’s day is not when the sun is shining” said Vickerman.

Alliant’s Zimmerman said the change means the utility’s solar additions which are slated to be in place by the end of next year only provide enough power for spring summer and fall.

“The way to overcome that for us right now is to install the battery” said Zimmerman.

Alliant said it has mitigated any supply chain constraints with its proposed battery projects. The utility plans to begin construction next year and put them in service by fall of 2025 pending approval from utility regulators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndwci5vcmcvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvZ292LWV2ZXJzLWpvaW5zLXBhY3Qtc3RhdGVzLW1vdmUtZm9yd2FyZC1yZWdpb25hbC1oeWRyb2dlbi1odWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Evers joins pact of states to move forward with regional hydrogen hub,"Clean energy advocates hope a recent move by Gov. Tony Evers to join in a regional consortium will help Wisconsin win federal funding to expand hydrogen power in the state.

Evers signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding. It’s an informal collaboration between Wisconsin Minnesota Montana and North Dakota marking the first phase of a long-term project to secure federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy or DOE that would create a network of clean energy infrastructure projects and partners.

“Clean hydrogen has the potential to play a key role in our clean energy efforts here in Wisconsin and across the country and I’m proud to be working together with this bipartisan group of governors to do the right thing for our states’ futures” Evers said in a statement.

Experts say “green hydrogen” is attracting attention because it can be generated carbon-free through electrolysis. The process separates water into hydrogen and oxygen. It’s a potential alternative to fossil fuel power generation that could transform the transportation aviation and manufacturing industries.

While most hydrogen is currently produced through burning fossil fuels state leaders say the process could be powered through renewables like solar and wind. Still they have not yet determined what the hub will look like.

“It’s an opportunity for regions states local governments businesses industry to come together to demonstrate production processing delivery storage and end-use of clean hydrogen” said Marie Redmond director of the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy.

Others like Chelsea Chandler climate energy and air program director for CLEAN Wisconsin are hopeful it’s an opportunity to make strides in hydrogen production.

“I think it’s exciting that Wisconsin is moving into a leadership position in this area” said Chandler.

She said that while other states like California and Hawaii “are further along on hydrogen” the step taken by Evers was one of several goals outlined in the state’s first Clean Energy Plan which passed last year.

Discussions on hydrogen hubs began at the end of last year when Congress passed the bipartisan infrastructure law awarding the DOE $8 billion according to Redmond.

States are competing for federal funding that would create at least four regional hubs nationwide.

“That’s the gamble right is that there’s only so much money to go around. And so we want to really really justify the need for having a hydrogen hub here” she said adding that while individual states could apply Wisconsin “saw power in numbers.”

The announcement came after the creation of the Midwestern Hydrogen Coalition a collaboration with Evers and six other governors.

Hydrogen is more expensive than fossil fuels but Redmond said the state is still dedicated to using hydrogen energy and investing in renewables regardless of funding.

“Even if we aren’t awarded money for a hydrogen hub we’re still going to move forward with figuring out how to build out hydrogen here in the Midwest” she said.

Is hydrogen the new natural gas?

Elsewhere groups are looking at hydrogen as they explore clean energy solutions. WEC Energy Group which is publicly regulated by the state is rolling out a pilot project in Michigan that would turn gas into hydrogen.

“The idea is could hydrogen replace natural gas in the future and if so how do we do that?” said WEC Energy Group spokesman Brendan Conway.

Conway said the company’s exploration of hydrogen is part of its goal to reduce carbon emissions by 60 percent by the end of 2025 and 80 percent by the end of 2030.

Chandler of CLEAN Wisconsin said hydrogen fills an important void in areas where other renewables can’t.

“The best path for decarbonizing our economy is going to be by electrifying our economy” she said. “But there are some sectors that are just not well-suited to electrification and where something like hydrogen has an advantage and can help kind of decarbonize those remaining challenging niche areas.”

Chandler said the challenge to making it a reliable source of fuel is isolating hydrogen gas.

“Hydrogen is super abundant in earth but pure hydrogen gas H2 is not” she said.

If the hub becomes a reality it would create more clean energy jobs including engineers developers consultants electrical workers among others according to Redmond. She said the state will need to invest in training and educating employees.

The federal Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy will match energy stakeholders with hubs to create more jobs and “support private sector development of hydrogen production.”

“We have to make a really concerted effort in production processing delivery storage and use of clean fuels” Redmond said. “And so this is a way for us to collectively work together on planning construction and operation of a commercial-scale hydrogen hub that addresses all of those dimensions of hydrogen.”

An uncertain but exciting future

Clean energy advocates agree there’s no clear roadmap yet for the future of hydrogen in Wisconsin. Most projects are in their early stages of research and development.

“There’s still a lot of things to be determined. But I think it’s incredibly exciting that we’re having these discussions and able to do pilot projects like ours testing it now to see what the future is going to be” Conway of WEC said.

Since 2013 about 10 percent of Wisconsin’s energy has been generated through renewables. It’s not yet clear how much hydrogen will be produced when the states join forces with the hub.

“But the requirement in the hydrogen hub proposal is that technologies integrated into hydrogen hubs will be capable of producing commercial scale quantities of clean hydrogen at the rate of at least 50 to 100 metric tons per day” said Redmond.

As with any energy source there are tradeoffs.

CLEAN Wisconsin’s Chandler said truly clean hydrogen must come from electrolysis or renewable sources like wind and solar which represent “a tiny fraction of how it’s made today.”

“It’s also a little hard to transport” she said. “Hydrogen gas is often stored as a compressed gas or a liquid hydrogen you have to be careful about leakage and combustion.”

Chandler said she thinks of hydrogen as just one tool at the state’s disposal.

Redmond said there’s great potential for “end-use diversity” or different ways to use hydrogen — through electric power generation industrial energy residential commercial heating or in the transportation sector.

The federal Inflation Reduction Act passed this year also creates tax credits that will make clean hydrogen generation more competitive with other methods of production according to the release.

Wisconsin and its neighboring partners will next submit a “concept paper” to the DOE in early November.

“After that point there’ll be some more definition around each of the hydrogen hubs what each state will be pursuing and how it looks to start” Redmond said.

The DOE will fund six to 10 more planning efforts but only two to three will be fully funded. Until then it’s a race — and it just began.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbmJheXByZXNzZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9ncmVlbi1iYXktYXJlYS1zdXBlcmludGVuZGVudHMtbWFrZS1hYm92ZS1hdmVyYWdlLXN0YXRld2lkZS1zYWxhcnktaGVyZXMtaG93LW11Y2gtdGhleS1tYWtlLzgwNjUzNTkwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green Bay-area superintendents make above the average statewide salary,"No commitment required.

IRVING Texas — This story originally appeared in the Dallas Business Journal a WFAA news partner.

Wells Fargo Bank is officially building a new campus in Irving.

After years of speculation and a handful of recent happenings Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott's office confirmed the construction of what will be a multi-tower regional corporate office campus in Dallas-Fort Worth.

“Texas has a long history of leadership in financial services attracting major operations for the world’s largest financial services companies as well as the most innovative startups in the field” said Abbott in a prepared statement. “Already home to the largest workforce in the financial services sector and as the new frontier for financial technology data centers and more Texas offers opportunities for Fortune 500 operations to grow and I thank Wells Fargo for their continuing investment in the great state of Texas and the best workforce in America.”

Wells Fargo Bank – which holds Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) as its parent organization – is expected to create 650 new jobs and make a capital investment of $455 million in the new campus. The San Francisco banking giant has been offered a Texas Enterprise Fund grant of just over $5 million as part of the new corporate office push.

The new campus is expected to open by the end of 2025.

“Currently most of our 3000 employees are located in several offices across the Metroplex"" said Tanya Sanders Wells Fargo head of Auto said in a statement. “We are thrilled to have a new state-of-the-art campus where we can bring the majority of our local workforce together for an even better employee experience which prioritizes wellness and sustainability.""

Yesterday the Business Journal reported that Wells Fargo acquired the land long-rumored to be the site of the bank's new Irving hub.

In early August Irving City Council approved incentives totaling $31 million for a forthcoming office development that is now slated to become a new regional campus.

For years sources have said that Wells Fargo was targeting hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space to house thousands of workers eventually selecting a build-to-suit option in Irving.

The majority of Dallas area employees will relocate to the new offices Wells Fargo said in a news release Tuesday.

The plans for the site which will be developed by Dallas-based KDC include two 400000-square-foot buildings with the potential to hold 4000 workers that are expected to be set within a broader mixed-use development.

The two office buildings are expected to sit within a larger mixed-use development featuring multifamily space with restaurants and retail. Wells Fargo’s ground-up project is expected to function as an anchor within a denser mini-CBD surrounded by other notable companies sources have said.

Wells Fargo stated that its new campus will include well-being rooms and gyms with remotely-led classes with wellness and outdoor recreation front-of-mind for employees. Other wellness amenities involve nearby walking and bicycle trails stand-up paddle board rentals a cycling studio and four golf courses.

The Irving development is slated to serve as Wells Fargo’s first net positive campus meaning it is expected to generate more energy than it consumes.

The office project will be constructed near the Irving Convention Center and Toyota Music Factory at the corner of West Las Colinas Boulevard and Promenade Parkway – one of the last and largest vacant sites in the area.

Some sources have concluded that an office development of this size could result in an eventual headquarters relocation for Wells Fargo though a spokesperson for the institution said in June it has ""no plans"" to move its headquarters.

An announcement Tuesday by Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that the San Francisco-based firm will construct the new campus in Irving’s Las Colinas development—a move that will bring together its local talent while creating hundreds of new jobs.

“Texas has a long history of leadership in financial services attracting major operations for the world’s largest financial services companies as well as the most innovative startups in the field” Abbott said in a statement. “Already home to the largest workforce in the financial services sector and as the new frontier for financial technology data centers and more Texas offers opportunities for Fortune 500 operations to grow.”

Campus to create 650 new jobs

Wells Fargo plans to make $455 million in capital investments in the 22-acre Irving campus which is expected to open by the end of 2025 and aims to create 650 jobs. The campus will bring together most of Wells Fargo’s 3000 local employees which are spread across several offices in the region according to Tanya Sanders the firm’s head of auto.

“We’re thrilled to have a new state-of-the-art campus where we can bring the majority of our local workforce together for an even better employee experience which prioritizes wellness and sustainability” Sanders said in a statement.

The campus will be built on the north shore of Las Colinas’ Lake Carolyn.

“With diverse lifestyle amenities just steps from the new campus access to a deep pool of highly qualified talent and a business-friendly environment we’re certain Irving-Las Colinas will prove to be a successful combination for Wells Fargo” Irving Mayor Rick Stopfer said in the statement.

Dallas firm KDC will be the developer

With Dallas firm KDC tapped as the developer for the project the Wells Fargo campus will include two 400000-square-foot multi-story buildings that include amenities like “well-being rooms” and gyms in addition to office space that are part of a mixed-use development project the Dallas Business Journal reports.

Texas Enterprise Fund offering $5M grant

The Wells Fargo project is being aided by a $5 million grant extended to Wells Fargo by the Texas Enterprise Fund which offers performance-based financial incentives and acts as a “deal-closing fund.” In addition the Irving City Council approved around $30 million in incentives for the $200 million project in August per The Dallas Morning News.

Irving is home to the offices of a number of Fortune 500 companies including McKesson Fluor Kimberly Clark and Vistra Energy.

“Wells Fargo’s decision in choosing Irving-Las Colinas for its corporate office marks one of the largest real estate deals in our community in the last two decades” Beth Bowman president and CEO of the Greater Irving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce and the Irving Economic Development Partnership said in a statement.

Deal closed by Mirasol Capital

Dallas-based investment firm Mirasol Capital announced that it completed the transaction with Wells Fargo for the 800000-square-foot campus at Mirasol’s Northshore District development. Mirasol said the Northshore District development that will be home to the Wells Fargo campus is the largest office development in the Las Colinas Urban Center since the 1985 completion of The Towers at Williams Square. The Northshore District could bring 4000 new jobs to the area Mirasol added. “The Wells Fargo corporate campus fits perfectly into our vision for the Northshore District a vibrant mixed-use development in the Urban Center of Las Colinas. Once combined with retail restaurants green space and high-end apartments the Northshore District will be one of the most sought after live-work-play environments in Texas” Mirasol Capital Managing Director Michael Maddox said in a statement. “We’re honored that Wells Fargo chose the Northshore District and proud to have KDC as a partner in the project.” Mirasol said it acquired 39 acres in the Las Colinas Urban Center through four acquisitions from 2018 to 2019 all while developing plans for the Northshore District a mixed-use development adjacent to the Toyota Music Factory and on Lake Carolyn. The Wells Fargo’s campus will serve as the anchor for Mirasol’s broader vision of creating “a modern urban environment” in Las Colinas. Mirasol Capital said that the transaction was made possible through a partnership with KDC as well as support from city of Irving officials the Las Colinas Association and the Irving Chamber of Commerce. Mirasol plans mixed-use project next door Wells Fargo will have company at its new campus: Mirasol Capital is planning a 17-acre mixed-use project adjacent to it with an “elevated multifamily living experience” retail public open space along the lakefront and an additional 400000 square feet of class A office space that will complement Toyota Music Factory’s entertainment district.

With the approval Furoscix becomes the first self-administered subcutaneous loop diuretic for those with worsening HF. The infusor delivers generic furosemide which relieves fluid retention and swelling that accompanies HF and other conditions such as liver and kidney disease.

The at-home device provides the equivalent of what a patient would receive by way of IV at a hospital the company said. There are more than 7 million people with HF in the U.S. and many are prone to hospitalization for congestion as they have become resistant to oral diuretics.

ScPharmaceuticals will launch Furoscix in the first quarter of next year “with the goal of driving rapid patient adoption to meet the needs of the $5.9 billion addressable market in the U.S.” CEO John Tucker said in a Monday release.

Clinical study of Furoscix showed 99.6% bioavailability equivalence with IV the company said with a similar diuretic profile as measured by urine production and sodium excretion.

The SmartDose delivery technology was developed by West Pharmaceutical Services. It consists of a pre-filled cartridge inserted into a single-use infusor which attaches to the abdomen. The device is activated by the press of a button delivering an 80 mg dose over five hours.

The company believes the product could change the “paradigm of how heart failure patients with congestion are treated and has the potential to become a new standard of care” said John Mohr the organization’s clinical development and medical affairs chief said.

The endorsement comes after considerable trial and error; scPharmaceuticals originally sought approval for the product in 2017 but that attempt was knocked back as the FDA demanded modifications to the device and additional validation studies. Then in 2020 the company received a second complete response letter that cited manufacturing issues and questions about testing and labeling.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmV5Y29udHJvbC5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZHMvd2h5LWdtcC1jb21wbGlhbmNlLWZvci1waGFybWEtY29tcGFuaWVzLW1lYW5zLWxpdHRsZS1pbi1pbmRpYS05MzAzMzAxLmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL3doeS1nbXAtY29tcGxpYW5jZS1mb3ItcGhhcm1hLWNvbXBhbmllcy1tZWFucy1saXR0bGUtaW4taW5kaWEtOTMwMzMwMS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Maiden and other Indian pharma firms exploited WHO certification process,"Late on October 8 three days after the news broke that four of its adulterated cough syrups were likely responsible for killing 66 kids in Gambia Maiden Pharmaceuticals a company with its registered office in Delhi and its manufacturing facility in Haryana broke its silence and said it was “shocked” at the development.

The cough syrups which were being exported only to the West African nation by the firm were found to be adulterated with diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol according to the World Health Organisation.

These two chemicals fatal for humans beyond a minuscule limit are not permitted in a pharmaceutical product but mass poisonings with its adulteration have happened on many occasions in different parts of the world including India.

Clarifying that the company was fully cooperating with authorities in investigations Maiden Pharma insisted that it had been diligently following the protocols laid down by the regulators.

Remarkably a one-page statement issued by the drug maker claimed it was certified under the WHO-Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO GMP) norms.

This claim though misleading—WHO itself does not issue any such certification—is a common feature on the letterheads of many drug makers.

The Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products (CoPP) issued by India’s national regulator which allows a drug maker to manufacture and also export a product assures that a plant complies with minimum standards of procedure and processes of pharmaceutical production as prescribed by the world health agency.

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

Every CoPP certificate at least on paper guarantees that a drug maker follows good manufacturing practices for specified pharmaceutical products.

However the certificate issued—following joint inspection by its authorities in collaboration with state drug regulators in no way guarantees that all products produced there are of standard quality say experts and as such holds little value.

Regulated vs unregulated market

Pharmaceuticals expert C M Gulhati explained that from the exports’ point of view the world is divided into two: regulated and unregulated markets with about 35 countries mainly in Western Europe and North America falling in the first category.

When a country like the US for instance has to issue a licence to a drug manufacturer unit in India the US Food and Drug Administration gets the facilities “spot inspected” without notice.

“There are very strict random checks of products exported to the US too once they reach there” said Gulhati adding that in contrast unregulated markets such as most African nations—barring South Africa to an extent—seldom check the drugs exported for quality.

This unfortunately means that while drug makers in India are more careful about the drugs that go to developed countries they are far more lax in what is supplied to low- and middle-income countries and often take “advantage of the regulatory oversights” he added.

A scientific paper published in 2014 by Indian and American researchers based on assessment of the quality of 1470 antibiotic and tuberculosis drug samples from India sold in Africa India and five mid-income non-African countries provides probably the only empirical evidence proving this though.

The researchers found that 10.9 percent of those products failed a basic assessment of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the majority of the failures are substandard (7 percent) as they contained some correct API but the amount of API was under-dosed.

“The distribution of these substandard products is not random: they are more likely to be found as unregistered products in Africa than in India or non-African countries” the authors had noted.

The Indian government had come down heavily on the research report calling it “motivated”.

Moneycontrol tried reaching drug controller general of India V G Somani and Haryana food and drug administrator Wazeer Singh Goyat to seek their responses on these observations but they were not available for comments despite multiple attempts.

An email seeking response from the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association a network of generic drug makers in the country has also not elicited any response so far either.

WHO’s role

Sources in the India office of the UN body explained that while the agency does not have any direct role to play in CoPP issued to drug makers in India it is independent of inspections done only for on-boarding pharmaceutical products from a company for pre-qualification programme for supply to United Nations agencies.

The inspections carried out by WHO are far stricter than the ones carried out by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for issuing CoPP pointed out Chinu Srinivas another pharmaceutical expert associated with the All India Drug Action Network a grouping of non-government organisations working to rationalise the use of medicines.

In response to a query by Moneycontrol the WHO said in an email that ""the stated manufacturer is authorized and regulated by the State Drugs Controller Haryana India"". This manufacturer has not been inspected nor any of its products assessed in any way by the WHO the world health agency said.

Understaffing corruption big concerns

A parliamentary standing committee report on the CDSCO’s functioning that came out in 2013 said that its mission was to “meet the aspirations….demands and requirements of the pharmaceutical industry” instead of protecting public health.

The situation since despite the committee putting on record the gross irregularities in its functioning has remained as bad.

Gulhati for instance pointed out that random inspections by central and state drug regulators at least twice a year at every drug manufacturing unit in India—there are about 10000 of them—are mandated as per the rules prescribed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 but that rarely happens.

“India’s CDSCO has less than 200 drug inspectors on its rolls. In comparison the USFDA has over 10000. One can imagine the seriousness with which the business of issuing CoPP and then carrying out inspections of plants and quality monitoring of finished products is taken here” said Gulhati who has also worked with the WHO in the past.

According to Srinivas while it may be difficult to establish on many occasions CoPP may be issued even without carrying out proper inspections.

Quality last priority?

In addition states are competing with each other to promote pharmaceutical production in their own backyard offering tax incentives and in many cases deciding only to procure medicines produced locally for government programmes.

It’s rather left to the manufacturer’s conscience to ensure that the drugs manufactured either for consumption locally or for export would be of standard quality which sometimes results in instances of substandard products reaching the market conceded a health ministry official citing problems such as shortage of manpower to test every batch of a drug produced in a plant.

But according to public health activist Dinesh Thakur that may be a ridiculous argument.

“If drug manufacturers have a very high degree of ethics instances of toxic substances getting mixed in the medicines or substandard drugs getting produced would not happen routinely” he said adding that India’s regulator and the government cannot escape their responsibility.

If some countries such as African nations are not so diligent in testing the quality of medicines coming from India it's all the more important for Indian regulators to keep an eye on what's being exported from drugmakers here said Thakur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3RoZXNvdXRoZmlyc3QuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9tYWlkZW4tcGhhcm1hLWNhc2UtZXhwbGFpbi13aHkteW91ci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWxpY2Vuc2UtbWF5LW5vdC1iZS1zdXNwZW5kZWQtY2FuY2VsbGVkLWFza3MtY2RzY29zLXNob3ctY2F1c2Utbm90aWNlLXRvLWRydWctY29tcGFueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maiden Pharma: Why should your license not be suspended/cancelled asks CDSCO show cause notice,"Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd a Haryana-based company whose cough syrups are suspected to be the reason for death of 66 children in Gambia. (Wikimedia Commons)

Three days after Kerala halted the sale of all drugs and syrups of the company a joint team of Haryana’s drugs controller and the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) inspected the manufacturing facility of Maiden Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday 11 October.

The inspection of the Kundli Sonepat facility of the company which hit the headlines last week when WHO linked four of its cough syrups to the death of 66 children in the West African nation of Gambia has found multiple violations.

The inspection followed a show cause notice sent to the company on 7 October a copy of which is with South First.

“During inspection many contraventions were detected (list attached). You are hereby served with a Show Cause Notice under Rule 85 (2) of Drug Rules 1945 as to why your manufacturing license may not be suspended/cancelled” says the notice issued by the State Drugs Controller-cum-Licensing Authority based in Panchkula Haryana.

The inspection came two days after Vivek Goyal a director at Maiden Pharmaceuticals had expressed shock over the deaths of 66 children in Gambia and claimed the company “diligently followed” all protocols required for the manufacturing of drugs.

What are the violations detected at Maiden Pharma?

The authorities during the inspection found that the batch numbers manufacturer name manufacturing date and expiry date on the invoices of propylene glycol (used in cough syrups) were missing.

The authorities mention in the show cause notice that the firm “has not performed the quality testing of propylene glycol for diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol”.

If propylene glycol which is usually used as a solvent in cough syrups is contaminated with diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol it can lead to death which WHO found to be the reason behind the acute kidney failure leading to the deaths of the 66 children in Gambia.

According to a pharma expert who did not want to be named this also raises the question of how these findings could be missed by the licensing authority.

“As part of the CoPP (Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product) application stability studies data must be provided; if so what were the findings? I am sure the licensing authorities were hand-in-glove with the pharma company” the expert told South First.

Maiden Pharma failed to produce logbooks

The authorities during the inspection also found that the complete plant was under renovation.

“The firm failed to produce the log books of equipment and instruments regarding manufacturing and testing for the drugs in question” said the notice.

It was also found that the batch numbers of the propelygene glycol and sorbittol solution materials used in the manufacturing of cough syrups was not the same as the one mentioned on the Certificate of Analysis (CoA) report of the syrup.

“Batch numbers of Propylene Glycol IP and Sorbittol Solution (70 percent) IP in the CoA report number MPLR22031105 and MPLR22022301 respectively was not found mentioned which was used in the manufacturing of the drug in question.”

Similarly was the case with batch numbers of Sodium Methyl Paraben IP in the CoA report.

Process validation not done

Maiden Pharmaceuticals had not performed process validation and analytical method validation for the drug products of these four cough syrups.

Meanwhile the drug firm submitted the six-month real-time and accelerate-stability data of the four cough syrups but at the time of investigation none of these four cough syrups “found charged in the stability chamber”.

Explaining this the pharma expert said: “For any drug/product to be approved by a licensing authority we need to provide evidence that my product has gone through the stability study.”

“This means the product must be tested for it’s capability to remain within its physical chemical microbiological therapeutic and toxicological specifications at a defined storage condition. The product is usually kept in stability chamber for say one year to two years and later provide a report for the same. This company has not kept the products for charge in the stability chamber.”

Meanwhile the firm on the certificate of analysis of Propylene Glycol IP had not given manufacturing and expiry dates in some cases. The authorities also found Propylene Glycol batch number E1105149 had been received and analysed on March 3 while the same analysis report was used for another drug.

What public health activist Dinesh Thakur says

Dinesh S Thakur is the whistleblower who exposed dangerous practices in the generic drug industry in 2012 and co-author of The Truth Pill: The Myth of Drug Regulation in India with public health activist Prashant Reddy T.

Though he appreciated the fact that the authorities conducted an inspection of the firm he says such inspections have happened in the past as well and the final outcome of the process — whether they hold the firm accountable — is what matters.

“We have seen such inspections in the past as well; nothing really comes of it. Let’s hope this time something concrete happens to hold this firm accountable” he told South First.

Thakur said that he found two observations made by the CDSCO authorities interesting.

One he said the report says that they did not find any products in the stability chamber while admitting that the company had submitted test results for accelerated stability studies when seeking marketing authorisation.

“I wonder how they created this data set if none of their products were being subjected to the stability testing process?”

The report also says that the firm has not performed process and analytical method validation on the drug products (syrups) in question.

“If their test methods were not validated how did they do batch release? On what basis did they release batches of these syrups to Gambia?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NwaGFybWEuaW4vZ2VuZXJpYy1hYWRoYWFyLWluYXVndXJhdGVzLTE1MS1mcmFuY2hpc2VzLW9uLWR1c3NlaHJhL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NwaGFybWEuaW4vYW1wL2dlbmVyaWMtYWFkaGFhci1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlcy0xNTEtZnJhbmNoaXNlcy1vbi1kdXNzZWhyYS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Generic Aadhaar inaugurates 151 franchises on Dussehra,"Generic Aadhaar founder Arjun Deshpande inaugurated 151 franchises of Generic Aadhaar in 29 districts of India on the occasion of Dussehra.

Design

Available in 500GB 1TB 2TB and 4TB configurations

Optional heatsink model available for console use

Single-sided so non-heatsink model works with laptops

If you’ve ever laid eyes on any of Western Digital’s Black range before then the aesthetic design of the SN850 should be immediately familiar to you. My review unit comes with a fairly thick heatshield complete with the signature corrugated black metal design that many products in the lineup share.

The heatsink itself has some meat on its bones. It’s easily one of the thickest that I’ve seen to date. This is due to the fact that this variant of the drive can be used on both PS5 and PC. In my test rig I found that the heatshield had enough clearance on my motherboard in quite the compact build so you’re unlikely to run into any issues here.

Although it’s now commonplace to see Gen 4.0 drives pushing over the 170-layer Flash memory like with the SK Hynix Platinum P41 the WD Black SN850 features 96L 3D TLC in-house memory. This means that the drive can push up to the 7000 MB/s read mark but suffers a little more where writes are concerned.

The write endurance itself though is to be commended. My 1TB review unit is rated for 600TB but 2TB models scale all the way up to 1200TB write endurance which is on par with the bleeding edge of Gen 4.0 models.

Performance

Sequential read and write up to 7000 MB/s and 5300 MB/s respectively

Strong gaming performance

Consistent file transfer times

The WD Black SN850 performed well in my industry-standard test coming well within the realms of the quoted figures by the brand. More specifically CrystalDiskMark gave me a score of 6302.70 MB/s read and 3153.74 MB/s write. All things considered this is one of the stronger read scores given the NAND flash memory in use.

AnvilPro was consistent with this performance too with a total figure of 17884.39. While not blazing fast compared to some models which would come after this is still more than respectable for the hardware.

File transfers demonstrate these rates well. Mortal Kombat 11 with its 110GB file size made the leap from another Gen 4 SSD to the WD Black SN850 with an average speed of 1.65GB/sec. This is backed up with smaller games too as Guilty Gear: Strive clocking in at 22.5GB was written onto the drive with a rate of 1.72GB/sec according to Steam’s internal directory manager.

Windows Explorer transfer times were even more impressive. I clocked an average rate of 2.1GB/sec when dragging and dropping different files onto the WD Black SN850. This included video files and software of varying sizes such as the Adobe Creative Suite. While this model may not be blazing a trail like it once did at release the figures show that it continues to hold up to modern standards on the PC platform.

The major drawback to the WD Black SN850 heatsink model in my opinion is just how hot the drive itself got when stress testing. The thick black metal heatsink performed well initially however heated up incredibly quickly to a point where it was uncomfortably warm when lifting it out of the test rig.

This is a little unusual given previous drive testing although the average person isn’t going to be benching drives in this manner. Just something to be aware of as prolonged exposure to high temperatures isn’t ideal for an SSD.

Latest deals

Should you buy it? You want excellent value for money from an established brand Given the average rates that the WD Black SN850 is selling for these days you’re getting excellent bang for your buck and benefitting from one of the biggest names in the industry too. You want to upgrade to what Gen 5.0 can offer There’s no getting around the fact that the SN850 is a little long in the tooth. Not only was it replaced by the SN850X earlier in the year but it’s soon to be left in the dust by what Gen 5.0 NVMe drives can offer those running the latest motherboards and processors.

Final Thoughts There’s a lot to recommend with the WD Black SN850 despite now being outperformed by other Gen 4.0 drives including some from the company’s line itself. But considering the recent price drop across the board Western Digital’s once flagship drive is a great value contender even in 2022. While this drive would be a bitter pill to swallow when factoring in the original $279.99 MSRP the heatsink model now frequently sells for around well under half of this. According to Western Digital itself you can score the heatsink model in 1TB configuration officially for $129.99 / £118.99 with some online retailers undercutting this recommended price point too. Whether you want a competent drive for your gaming PC or looking to expand the total storage in your PS5 console for the asking price there are not many drives that can perform as well as the WD Black SN850 when all is said and done. Trusted Score

How we test When testing an SSD we use both synthetic benchmark tests while also determining file transfers via both Steam and Windows explorer.



We also factor in the likes of price design and temperature when reaching a final score. I used the WD Black SN850 as my main storage drive for over two weeks. I played different games as well as used the SSD for productivity and file transfers. Used synthetic benchmark tests to determine performance.

Sustainability

Trusted Reviews holds the fact that global warming is not a myth as a core value and will continuously endeavor to help protect our planet from harm in its business practices.

As part of this mission whenever we review a product we send the company a series of questions to help us gauge and make transparent the impact the device has on the environment.

You can see a detailed breakdown of the questions we ask and why in our sustainability info page. In lieu of answering each of these questions Vivo has provided us with its company Sustainability Report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2tzYW5kZmlsZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTAvMTEtYW5kLTEyLXBsYXR0ZXItZGlzay1kcml2ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disk drive market to plunge due to inflation war and hyperscalers' already high inventories – Blocks and Files,"TrendFocus is expecting around 39 million disk drives to be shipped in calendar Q3 down 42 percent on the same period a year ago and 14 percent lower than the prior quarter.

The cause of the drop is weaker demand from cloud providers inflation the conflict between Ukraine and Russia war and supply chain difficulties says TrendFocus.

One area bucking the trend is nearline (high-capacity) disk drives where capacity is forecast to be flat as fewer high-cap drive shipments are offset by increased capacity per drive.

According to Wells Fargo analyst Aaon Rakers TrendFocus estimates that planned HDD unit volumes in for Q3 and Q4 will be in the region of 35 million which compares to the Q2’s 44.7 million and Q1’s 52.8 million. Total 2022 disk drive unit ships could be 170 million equating to a 34 percent decline on 2021.

TrendForce thinks that demand will start to rise in Q2 of 2023 as cloud buyers use existing inventories however that is subject to imporvements in the overall economy. The analyst also thinks per-drive capacity increases will come from adding platters with 11-platter nearline drives using the existing 10-platter drives’ 0.5mm thick aluminum-based substrates.

A 10-platter conventionally recorded 20TB drive would then become an 11-platter 22TB drive and a 22TB shingled would transition to a 24.2TB drive.

TrendFocus says thinner platters would enable 12-platter drives to be built. How this would play out with high-capacity recording methods such as Western Digital and Toshiba’s MAMR and Seagate’s HAMR is an interesting question. It could mean that less aggressive MAMR/HAMR technology would be needed to reach a capacity point such as 30TB.

A 12-platter version of an existing 10-platter 20TB drive would reach 24TB leaving 6TB to be made up by MAMR or HAMR tech.

The research group suggests Seagate may need to improve HAMR disk drive production quality to reduce scrap rates and increase profitability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JldGhlbC1uYXRpdmUtY29ycG9yYXRpb24tZ2NpLXBhcnRuZXItdG8tY2xvc2UtZGlnaXRhbC1kaXZpZGUtaW4td2VzdGVybi1hbGFza2EtMzAxNjQ1MzQyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bethel Native Corporation GCI partner to close digital divide in Western Alaska,"ABOUT THE GRANTS

GCI will upgrade its existing cable plant in Bethel and deploy fiber-to-the-premises local access networks in the four other communities.

and deploy fiber-to-the-premises local access networks in the four other communities. Consumers in these communities will have access to 2 gig consumer broadband service plans that include unlimited data and affordable prices. Customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program will be eligible for free internet service.

The service is scheduled to launch in Bethel at the end of 2024.

at the end of 2024. The Bethel fiber project will connect in Dillingham to another NTIA-funded fiber project to be constructed by Nushagak Telephone which in turn connects to an USDA RUS-funded fiber network that connects to Anchorage . By leveraging other federal investment BNC and GCI are using every NTIA Bethel grant dollar in the most efficient way possible.

GCI has been awarded a $31 million USDA RUS ReConnect grant to construct long-haul fiber and local fiber in the Y-K Delta communities of Atmautluak Kasigluk Nunapitchuk Quinhagak and Tuntutuliak.

GCI will construct and operate the fiber and will deploy fiber-to-the-premises local access networks in the five communities.

Consumers in these communities will receive 2 gig consumer broadband service plans that include access to unlimited data and affordable prices. Customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program will be eligible for free internet service.

This project will connect to the Bethel fiber leveraging federal dollars in an efficient way.

""The residents of the 10 grant communities are now looking forward to faster speeds more data and having much more affordable plans in the coming years"" said BNC President & CEO Ana Hoffman. ""The people of the Y-K Delta are resourceful respectful and resilient. We have a strong sense of community and we depend upon collaboration with our friends and neighbors to be successful. We know the value of presence and that is why I have so much confidence in this partnership between BNC and GCI and our collective commitment to deliver this service together.""

""Ana is fond of saying 'a first-class people deserve a first-class internet service.' We couldn't agree more"" said GCI President & COO Greg Chapados. ""GCI pledges to the people of the Y-K Delta our partner BNC and NTIA and RUS that we will build and operate a first-rate network that will not just narrow but eliminate the rural-urban digital divide for the 10000-plus residents of Bethel and the other served communities.""

In addition to Indigenous and community stakeholders the push for federal support of Alaska's broadband projects including the Airraq Network also received broad support from state and federal leaders.

""I was a big supporter of these projects and am thrilled about this announcement"" said Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy. ""These types of infrastructure projects are some of the most important investments in Alaska today. These projects will finally bring high-speed affordable internet to homes businesses schools and health care facilities. High-speed broadband service will attract more investment in Alaska; it will grow our economy. Most importantly it will create more job opportunities for our youth in the communities where they live.""

""Congratulations to Bethel Native Corporation and to all the villages in the area that are going to stand to benefit from this expansion of broadband"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski. ""We've been working hard on the infrastructure bill doing everything that we can to try to help facilitate through NTIA these grants and opportunities that will be coming to really connect all of Alaska and most particularly rural Alaska. From Kasigluk to Eek you're going to see benefits. This is good reason for celebration and I'm glad to be part of it.""

""Access to high-speed reliable internet can be life-changing for a community enhancing the delivery of health care and education and opening doors for small businesses and entrepreneurs"" said Sen. Dan Sullivan. ""Many of our rural Alaska Native communities for too long have found themselves without the broadband connectivity that most Americans take for granted. I'm glad to see the significant federal infrastructure dollars we secured being deployed to break down the digital divide and improve the lives and wellbeing of thousands of Alaskans across the Lower Kuskokwim region.""

""On this Indigenous Peoples' Day I'm honored to join you in celebrating the NTIA and USDA awards to Bethel Native Corporation and GCI"" said Rep. Mary Peltola. ""With this funding fiber service will be brought to residents in 10 communities including Bethel my home. My kids and I can't wait to enjoy the service we will have there once it's constructed. And the name for the network is just perfect.""

""It was a real pleasure to be able to visit with so many of you in August"" said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson recalling his trip to Western Alaska over the summer. ""I was honored on that trip to meet with so many community members in places like Napaskiak and Napakiak and Bethel to hear firsthand from leading educators and health professionals. It was honestly humbling for me and for our team that was there to hear firsthand to see the real connectivity challenges that people are facing on the ground and the real impacts that these grants could make. We know that delivering connectivity to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is critical as we were hearing; access to jobs healthcare education all the things that your community needs but as you so clearly showed us on this visit this is not just about bringing the internet to the Y-K Delta this is also about bringing you all your communities your local knowledge your beautiful culture to the broader internet community. And for that I think we are all going to be very grateful.""

""It's incredible this big lift and USDA Rural Development is so thrilled to just be a piece of that federal funding and we're so excited to be working alongside tribes municipalities and telecommunications companies like GCI to connect really remote and rural communities"" said USDA Rural Development State Director for Alaska Julia Hnilicka. ""I've had the honor to go out to the Y-K Delta a few times this summer and I have just been as a lifelong Alaskan so blown away by the beauty and the complexity of culture and I'm beyond-words-thrilled to be a part of even a small part of sharing that culture with the world. Internet connectivity is not just about what it brings in but what we are able to share out from Alaska as well.""

""It has truly been my honor to work with the Bethel Native Corporation as well as GCI as we've worked through the process of bringing this application forward to fruition"" said NTIA Division Chief Tribal Connectivity and Nation to Nation Coordination Adam Geisler. ""We're entering an age now where access to affordable reliable broadband service is going to be at your fingertips here in the very near future and again I want to emphasize affordability.""

If priced right this is a good drive particularly at 2TB. It balances performance and efficiency nicely with reasonable support but it does not particularly stand out.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

The Acer Predator GM7000 takes a winning formula of components and puts unique branding on it. This combination is powerful efficient and particularly compelling at 2TB but the GM7000 is in a crowded market. This high-end PCIe 4.0 drive would be happy in the PlayStation 5 or in your PC with help from Acronis True Image OEM software. Otherwise this SSD does not stand out particularly against the very fastest drives we’ve tested like the SK hynix Platinum P41 and WD Black SN850X.

The GM7000 is best compared to the HP FX900 Pro since it has the same controller and flash. The pSLC caching scheme is also similar. While it appears some tweaks were made to the GM7000 possibly through updated firmware it largely falls into the same position as the FX900 Pro and other drives like it. These drives are often a bit cheaper than other high-end PCIe 4.0 SSDs particularly at 2TB.

Acer announced a partnership with Biwin more than a year ago and we see its flash on the GM7000. Biwin previously worked heavily with HP which includes the FX900 Pro. Biwin provides services with flash binning and the manufacture of drives. It is not surprising that the GM7000 is so close to the FX900 Pro. It does mean that you have a bit better idea of what you’re getting. Otherwise you are relying on Acer’s support for warranty and software.

The Acer GM7000 is available at 512GB 1TB 2TB and 4TB capacities. This is a nice range but we were not able to find the drive available at its highest capacity at the time of this review. The other capacities actually lowered in price during writing reflecting that the NAND and SSD markets have been and remain in a steady price decline.

The closest competitor the HP FX900 Pro which is slightly cheaper at 2TB. 2TB has become an increasingly popular capacity and there have been many sales on drives of this size this year so it is a competitive space. One advantage the GM7000 has is its graphene foam heat pad something the FX900 Pro also uses. Graphene has very high thermal conductivity and PCIe 4.0 SSDs can get quite hot so this is a solution that saves a bit of physical space.

The GM7000 is otherwise unexceptional coming with a 5-year warranty and 300 600 1300 and 3000 TBW ratings for its respective capacity options. Rated IOPS are quite high as on the FX900 Pro. Sequential performance can top out at 7.4/6.7GBps for reads and writes respectively thanks to the use of newer flash with the IG5236 controller. This makes for a powerful drive that checks all the expected boxes.

Software and Accessories

The GM7000 comes with a free customized copy of Acronis True Image OEM. This is a piece of software that allows you to clone backup or image your drives which can make upgrading your storage easier. This is barebones software and there are good freeware options but it’s still nice to have it bundled.

A Closer Look

This is a double-sided drive at 2TB with a label on the rear covering two NAND packages and one DRAM package. Removing the top graphene pad reveals a single DRAM module the controller and two NAND packages.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The controller is an InnoGrit IG5236 a popular and powerful PCIe 4.0 solution. It competes with the Phison E18 the upcoming SMI SM2264 and proprietary designs from Western Digital Samsung Crucial and SK hynix. InnoGrit as a company is a relative newcomer but it has veterans at its helm. Its latest controller designs have proven quite effective and are often paired with drives that are a bit cheaper than the competition.

The DRAM package is NANYA NT5AD512M16A4 DDR4 in a 512M x 16b configuration for a total of 8Gb or 1GB. As there are two packages the total DRAM on this 2TB drive is 2GB. This is an ample amount of memory even for heavy workloads.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The flash packages are labeled BW29F4T08ENLEE. This is the same flash that we saw on the 2TB FX900 Pro. Biwin has long managed HP’s SSDs and over a year ago it was announced that it would also work with Acer. Historically this has not been an issue as some of HP’s SSD products have been quite excellent such as with the EX920 and EX950.

The “BW” represents Biwin with 29 being the common code for Micron (or Intel) Technology. These are 4Tb or 512GB modules four for a total of 2TB in a typical 8-bit configuration. The flash is of the 176-layer generation and TLC. This flash is found on a ton of drives and has proven to be quite fast. It is in fact the flash that Phison chose for its preliminary I/O+ firmware albeit at 1600 MT/s. The flash on the GM7000 is the standard 1200 MT’s although this does not have a huge impact on performance.

The World Economic Forum on Tuesday announced the addition of 11 factories and industrial sites including three from India to its Global Lighthouse Network . From India the additions are pharma major Cipla 's Indore facility Dr Reddy's Laboratories' Hyderabad facility and the Mondelez facility in Sri City.The Global Lighthouse Network is a community of over 100 manufacturers that are showing leadership in applying Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies such as artificial intelligence 3D-printing and big data analytics.The WEF further said four lighthouse members with outstanding environmental footprint reductions have been given an additional designation of Sustainability Lighthouses These four include Unilever 's Dapada facility in India.The WEF said that amid warnings of a global recession energy price hikes and disrupted supply chains the lighthouse factories offer business leaders and policymakers examples of how the manufacturing sector can stay competitive and continue to create jobs.""Manufacturing is the backbone of both social and economic development. With the right corporate strategies and industrial policies it provides high-wage jobs commercial innovation and drives environmental sustainability - even in times of crisis"" said Francisco Betti Head of Advanced Manufacturing and Value Chains at the WEF.The new factories of the lighthouse network show how manufacturers can meet business goals while having a positive impact on economies people's livelihoods and the environment Betti added.The 11 new lighthouses also include Agilent Technologies in Singapore Danone in Opole (Poland) Flex in Sorocaba (Brazil) and five in China (CATL Haier  Midea Sany Heavy Industry and Western Digital).On Cipla the WEF said the company deployed digital automation and analytics solutions to 22 Indian sites to preserve access to high-quality affordable drugs globally while facing an increase in material and labour costs.The company's Oral Solid Dosage facility in Indore led this journey by implementing 30 Fourth Industrial Revolution use cases thereby improving total cost by 26 per cent and enhancing quality by 300 per cent while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 28 per cent.For Dr Reddy's Hyderabad facility the WEF said the 25-year-old site facing business challenges from severe price erosion and rapidly evolving quality expectations embarked on large-scale digitalisation to sustain and grow in the generics pharma market.The site deployed more than 40 Fourth Industrial Revolution use cases by operating in garage mode and leveraging IIoT (industrial internet of things) and democratised platform for advanced analytics.As a result it improved manufacturing cost by 43 per cent while proactively enhancing quality and reducing energy by 41 per cent.Mondelez's Sri City facility deployed end-to-end digitalisation predictive analytics artificial intelligence and advanced automations with an aim to outgrow the market through superior volume delivery cost leadership and build further resilience and diversity in a volatile environment.It managed to increase labour productivity by 89 per cent reduce manufacturing costs by 38 per cent and sustain 50 per cent female workforce thus making it a benchmark manufacturing site for Mondelez globally the WEF added."

Lands proposed for inclusion in the new Safe Harbor Agreement consist of 637021 acres located in Whatcom Skagit Snohomish King Pierce Thurston Lewis Cowlitz Wahkiakum Pacific and Grays Harbor counties.

Under the proposed Safe Harbor Agreement Weyerhaeuser will continue to manage their forest lands for timber production while protecting all previously documented occupied marbled murrelet habitat and voluntarily agreeing to defer harvest of certain other areas identified as potential marbled murrelet nesting habitat on their lands. If implemented under the proposed terms the Safe Harbor Agreement will provide a net conservation benefit for the rare species.

The marbled murrelet was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1992. The bird spends most of its life in marine waters. Unlike many of its seabird relatives however the species nests in forests up to several dozen miles inland. It is found along the Pacific Coast from Alaska to central California.

Al Sharpton protest regarding Cleveland headquarters construction,"Sherwin-Williams has responded to a protest being held on Tuesday regarding the construction of its new headquarters.

CLEVELAND — Just before Rev. Al Sharpton began to speak at a rally outside of Cleveland City Hall calling for a Black-owned firm to be a key partner in the construction of Sherwin-Williams' global headquarters project on Tuesday the Cleveland-based company released a statement responding to the protest.

“Sherwin-Williams has been meeting with Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb since he was elected. His support of our Company over that time has been and continues to be steadfast"" Sherwin-Williams Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John G. Morikis said in a statement. ""While we received many attractive offers to relocate our new headquarters from several cities nationally Mayor Bibb’s strong leadership and clear vision for Cleveland have only solidified our choice to stay and invest here. Working together with Mayor Bibb and his administration we are focused on the right things we are excited by what we have already accomplished and we are confident that our continued partnership will achieve our shared goals of helping Cleveland the region and Sherwin-Williams thrive for decades to come.""

Sherwin-Williams also noted that it was hosted by the Urban League of Cleveland on Monday ""to provide a joint update on the Building our Future project and the positive impact the project is having on the local community."" Attendees at the event included:

Justin Bibb Cleveland Mayor

Blaine Griffin Cleveland City Council President

Marsha Mockabee President and CEO Urban League of Cleveland

Ron Todd Minority Affairs Liaison to Office of the Ohio State Governor

Pernel Jones Cuyahoga County Council District 8

Shakorie Davis Urban League CAP Program Facilitator

Rev. Dr. Stephen Rowan Cleveland Bethany Baptist Church

Pastor Anthony L. Small Sr. Cleveland Starlight Missionary Baptist Church

Pastor Jimmy L. Gates Sr. Cleveland Zion Hill Baptist Church

Sherwin-Williams also said that its ""deliberate and intentional process of ensuring diverse firms are included in the Building Our Future project"" has resulted in $122 million in contracts to diverse firms with a commitment that is expected to exceed $180 million and engagement with 57 diverse firms on the project to date.

""It is unfortunate that some are using their personal agendas and animosities to drive a false narrative and cloud the positive impact the Building Our Future project is making on the Cleveland community now and for years to come"" the company said.

According to a flyer for Tuesday's protest the rally aimed to ""urge the Mayor and the City Council to show the public where taxpayer dollars are being spent on the construction of The Sherwin-Williams Company's new global headquarters. Black-owned firm should be named key partner with major managerial responsibilities and higher earning potential.""

Sherwin-Williams has broken ground on both their new downtown Cleveland headquarters and the Brecksville research and development center. Both facilities are slated to be completed in late 2024.

The Urban League of Greater Cleveland says it plans to continue its partnership with Sherwin-Williams.

“There are three criteria that we consider when engaging in public-private partnerships” said Marsha A. Mockabee President and Chief Executive Officer of the Urban League of Greater Cleveland in a statement. “There must be an authentic commitment to diversity and inclusion a demonstrated accountability to achieving the metrics and the willingness to develop long-term strategies that empower communities and change lives. The Urban League is pleased to partner with Sherwin-Williams to bring its community impact commitment to fruition.”

3News sat down with Mockabee who added that while she understands aspirational goals there are certain processes and policies that should go in place first.

""You first have to create policy because without policy there's no teeth to hold people accountable so that's the first step"" Mockabee said. ""I think the second step is you have to make sure that there is a pipeline of the kind of talent that you're talking about that you want in those positions and that's what the Urban League is doing in helping Sherwin-Williams with their commitment.""

Mockabee said developing policy can allow people in the African American community to benefit from contracts and the ""opportunities to work and grow and develop wealth.""

She added that conversations with civil rights colleagues and with partners involved in the project have informed the Urban League's decision to stay aligned with local leadership and work with Sherwin-Williams.

""Our job the Urban League is we feel to extend the benefit from that building into our communities in ways that even Sherwin-Williams doesn't necessarily see immediately"" she said. ""So we're that sort of broker in between to help Sherwin-Williams see how they can bring benefit into the communities and the communities can benefit from them staying here as a headquartered organization.""

The automaker also plans to spend $700 million to retool three of its Ohio plants to make electric vehicles and provide components for them.

The plant part of a joint venture with South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution will employ 2200 workers. The three plants where the $700 million will be invested − the Marysville Auto Plant the East Liberty Auto Plant and the Anna Engine Plant − will add 327 workers.

Honda says the two companies have committed to spending a minimum of $3.5 billion on the plant but that total could eventually hit $4.4 billion.

Reactions:Political business leaders celebrate Honda investment in Ohio battery factory

Honda announced its partnership with LG in August but did not identify where the plant would be built.

Why Honda chose Jeffersonville

The company said Tuesday that the plant will be built in the Mid-West Mega Commerce Center east of Interstate 71 and near U.S. Route 35 near Jeffersonville about 40 miles southwest of Columbus and 70 miles northeast of Cincinnati. The state expects to make ""targeted investments"" to improve roadways in the area said Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks.

The location was picked for several reasons including proximity to Honda's plants access to resources and availability of labor Bob Nelson executive vice president of American Honda Motor Co. told reporters in advance of Tuesday's announcement.

The announcement comes 45 years to the day when Honda released details of its first manufacturing plant in the state. It lays out the automaker's transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles in coming decades.

""We now face a once-in-a-100-years change from the internal combustion engine to electrification"" Nelson said. ""Once again this requires a bold vision for the future.""

Ohio to become electric vehicle hub

Honda plans to make Ohio an electric vehicle hub that will produce expertise to be shared across Honda’s North American auto operations in the years ahead. It will leverage Honda's longstanding production product development and purchasing operations in central Ohio.

“In another major step toward electrification LG Energy Solution’s innovative battery technologieswill not only power Honda’s brand-new EV models but support Ohio’s green economy” Dong-Myung Kim an LG executive vice president said in a statement.

Honda and LG plan to start construction early next year with a goal of having the plant finished by the end of 2024. Production of pouch-type lithium-ion batteries is scheduled to begin by the end of 2025.

The plant will produce batteries exclusively for Honda and Acura vehicles.

“It has been more than four decades since Honda first saw great promise in Ohio and although the way we manufacture vehicles is evolving one thing that will stay the same is the quality of our workforce and their ability to get the job done” Gov. Mike DeWine said as part of the announcement at the Statehouse.

""It’s another win for America and another win for Ohio with Honda and LG committing more than $5 billion toward electric vehicle battery manufacturing and factory retooling across the state"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.

Honda's EV strategy

Honda has trailed some of its competitors when it comes to electric vehicles. Honda offers hybrid Accords and CR-Vs and plans to introduce the fully electric Prologue SUV which it's developing with GM in 2024 replacing the Clarity electric sedan.

Honda plans to begin production of EVs in 2026. The automaker has set a goal of all of its sales coming from battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles by 2040 and becoming carbon neutral for all products and corporate activities by 2050.

Workers in Anna Ohio will make the battery case that will be combined with the battery modules from the battery plant on a line at Marysville. The complete battery unit will be installed in electric vehicles by workers in Marysville and East Liberty Ohio.

“This event will set the course to chart the development of our electrified future for the next 40 years and beyond’’ Nelson said.

Nelson said financial incentives with the state are being negotiated.

Honda isn't ready to announce how many electric vehicles will be made in the state Nelson said.

Honda's history of Ohio investment

The investment extends Honda's reach into the state that dates to 1979 when it began motorcycle production in Marysville. It began making cars in Marysville in November 1982.

Honda has invested $14.2 billion in Ohio and has 14400 employees. It opened a $124 million wind tunnel earlier this year in East Liberty.

The announcement is the latest in a string of announcements by automakers and other companies tied to electric vehicles in the state.

LG is in a similar partnership with General Motors in Lordstown in northeast Ohio and Ford is investing $1.5 billion at its plant at Avon Lake to produce commercial electric vehicles. GM is making a separate $760 million investment in Toledo to make drive units that will be used in future GM electric vehicles.

A Chinese manufacturer of materials used in batteries that power electric vehicles and other products Semcorp Manufacturing USA has announced a $900 million investment in Sidney in western Ohio.

A new U.S. law the Inflation Reduction Act gives companies even more incentive to build batteries in North America. It includes a tax credit of up to $7500 that could be used to defray the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle. But to qualify for the full credit the electric vehicle must contain a battery built in North America with 40% of the metals mined or recycled on the continent.

Nelson said the company has been planning the battery and plant investments for years well ahead of the law's passage earlier this year.

Electric vehicle sales are expected to rise dramatically between now and 2030 in the U.S. and globally but even at the start of the next decade they will be just over one-third of U.S. new vehicle sales. The LMC Automotive consulting firm expects EVs to be 5.6% of U.S. sales this year rising to 13.5% by 2025 and 36.4% in 2030.

By then Rokit with its primary product lines in mobile phones and alcohol had a short but notable track record in the world of sports. Within six months it had secured multimillion-dollar deals with the Los Angeles Chargers and Formula One’s Williams Racing and was the inaugural jersey patch sponsor for the Houston Rockets a high-profile partnership announced the previous fall.

Activity like that tends to raise antennas in front offices across the sports industry and representatives for the Raiders and Legends the team’s sales agent made multiple trips to the company’s oceanfront office in Pacific Palisades Calif. Other franchises also took notice even though Rokit’s yearly revenue did not cover the big-ticket deals it had already made.

The Raiders’ due diligence two people familiar with the process told Sportico focused on the financial heft of the prospective sponsor’s biggest backer Patrón Spirits Co.’s billionaire co-founder John Paul DeJoria who’d just sold his 70% stake in the tequila giant to Bacardi in a $5.1 billion deal. At the same time DeJoria who also co-founded and runs the Paul Mitchell haircare juggernaut was working with his longtime British business partner Jonathan Kendrick to boost their mercurial 20-year-old ROK brand into Rokit.

DeJoria though not an officer nor employee was an active part of the Rokit discussions with the Raiders the sources said. They added that his involvement in addition to multiple conversations with counterparts at the Rockets Chargers and Williams Racing made the Raiders comfortable signing a long-term agreement with a relatively unknown entity.

The talks led to a 10-year deal worth more than $60 million a sizable partnership even by NFL standards which made Rokit the Raiders’ official phone and included naming rights to a 13000-square-foot club inside Allegiant Stadium. In March 2020 Raiders players and cheerleaders participated in a photo shoot in Las Vegas to announce the deal.

But it soon fell apart. Rokit owed the team $5.9 million for the first year of the agreement but it never paid. When Allegiant Stadium opened later that year the Rokit Field Club was nowhere to be found.

Representatives for the Raiders and Legends declined to comment on the deal or its aftermath. Kendrick who serves as Rokit’s CEO and chairman and the company’s public relations department did not respond to several requests for comment solicited last week. In an email Alex Merino a Los Angeles-based attorney representing Kendrick and Rokit wrote that some of Sportico’s questions “are based on rumors and false information” but declined to comment or elaborate further. DeJoria did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent to his assistant and a Paul Mitchell spokesperson.

Sports sponsorship has been just a small part of Rokit’s sprawling ambitions which its co-founders have directed at everything from e-bikes apparel and water purification to nationwide internet infrastructure discount legal services and telemedicine. Despite its varied interests and a complex web of private limited companies to pursue them financial reports and interviews with former Rokit insiders chronicle a company that has never proven financially sustainable produced very few actual products and failed to deliver on many of its business commitments. Rokit has shown itself to be quite adept at one thing: attracting bold-faced names and high-profile companies from sports to Hollywood into its orbit only to leave many of its partners feeling shortchanged.

Over the past few years Rokit has been accused of bailing on sports promotional commitments totaling well more than $100 million according to court filings and bankruptcy documents reviewed by Sportico. A number of these deals have since devolved into litigation including a particularly contentious legal battle between the company and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta. Meanwhile six subsidiaries inside what Rokit refers to as its “Group of Companies” have filed for bankruptcy in the last 18 months with teams of trustees and lawyers now trying to sort how connected those entities are and who should pay for contracts going unfulfilled.

Despite those setbacks a number of sports entities are still doing business with Rokit particularly those in smaller racing circuits and more niche sports such as equestrian beach handball and snooker. Rokit Venturi Racing finished second in this season’s Formula E team standings and DeJoria’s daughter Alexis is currently racing in NHRA events sponsored by Rokit and one of its liquor labels. Snooker legend Ronnie O’Sullivan is also a Rokit endorser having agreed to respell his nickname “Rocket” as part of the sponsorship. It’s unclear why a few of these deals appear active amid all the defaults and bankruptcy filings. Representatives for all three didn’t respond to requests for comment.

‘Return of Kendrick’

While DeJoria’s wealth has in practice or prospect enabled the operation the man in charge is Kendrick—ROK stands for “Return of Kendrick.”

In numerous public forums Kendrick has described Rokit as embodying a kind of “compassionate capitalism” while the company’s websites and social media accounts continue to proclaim a motto of self-sacrifice: “Rokit does things differently taking our products partnerships & responsibilities very seriously but never ourselves.”

However Kendrick’s rhetoric has been repeatedly cast into doubt by the company’s modus operandi and his deportment as chief executive.

In an email Kendrick sent his staff in late 2018—a copy of which was obtained by Sportico and authenticated by multiple sources—the CEO suggested that he would start making Rokit employees wear badges in the office to denote how useful he perceived them. Those who were the most disappointing would be tagged with the classic four letter f-word Kendrick wrote explaining it stood for “Futile Useless C***sucker Tosser.”

The company which sources say has never employed more than 60 full-time workers has seen numerous departures in recent years.

“The crazy thing is it was almost like the rug got pulled out from under our feet every time we made progress” said one former staffer who worked on Rokit's wireless portfolio. “It just so frequently felt like it was on purpose not to make a profit.”

In the sextet of bankruptcy petitions each of which bear Kendrick’s signature most of the Rokit satellite entities report assets in the low five figures—if anything at all—and liabilities well into seven and eight figures. A substantial part of the latter includes multimillion-dollar unsecured claims by the Raiders ($1.97 million) Rockets ($11.23 million) Williams Racing (£14.5 million converted as $18.59 million) and Manchester United (£7 million converted as $8.97 million). Smaller creditors include the Tennis Channel ($625000) and Chargers All-Pro safety Derwin James ($30000).

The sports defaults followed a similar saga in the music industry involving Rok Mobile Inc. a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service the company unveiled in 2014 which spawned several breach-of-contract lawsuits. In 2018 Warner Music Sony and Orchard Enterprises filed separate complaints in New York Superior Court seeking to recover millions of dollars in unpaid bills from their licensing agreements with Rok Mobile. The court issued judgments for the companies and even granted them permission to serve DeJoria with discovery requests in Texas where he maintains one of his residences. Those awards however have now also become ensnared in a federal bankruptcy action.

Rok’s Metamorphosis

A predecessor to Rokit Rok Entertainment Group went public in 2007 in a $1.1 billion reverse merger a process that typically offers very little scrutiny. Its stock traded under the ticker ROKE on the pink sheets. Kendrick served as chairman of the board and CEO for the company which developed its mobile streaming business ideas while DeJoria and his family held the plurality of the company’s shares through two trusts according to SEC filings. However in 2012 Rok Entertainment Group had the registration of its stock pulled by the Securities and Exchange Commission after it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports over the course of four years. The company’s last SEC disclosure came in June 2008 when it reported a net loss of over $20 million for the previous three months.

In 2016 Kendrick and DeJoria pivoted from selling streaming services on other mobile providers to trying to manufacture their own device. Under the banner of Rok Mobile International they announced an alliance with Human Health Organization (H20) a tech group funded by filmmaker James Cameron and run by his brother John. H20 had at the time been working on a two-in-one product combining a cell phone and vape pen.

The joint Rok/H20 venture which was set to be overseen by John Cameron and Kendrick promised to utilize NASA technology in creating the first low-radiation phone which would be equipped with Rok Mobile’s hodgepodge suite of streaming music burial insurance and telemedicine services.

“The moment I met with the ROK founders they got it” John Cameron said in the press release announcing the joint venture. DeJoria himself publicly touted the partnership at the time while promoting Good Fortune a documentary about his life.

However according to three sources Kendrick tussled with John Cameron over control of the phone project eventually leading to Cameron’s ouster. The sources said that this in turn upset James Cameron and eventually resulted in the dissolution of the merger by 2018. After a brief attempt to revive business on its own H20 folded. John Cameron died in 2020 and James Cameron did not respond to a request for comment through his agency CAA.

Newly emboldened by DeJoria’s Patrón liquidity event Rokit's next pursuit was its most wildly ambitious project yet: a partnership involving an Indian state‐owned telecommunications company that would turn a vast swath of the world’s largest country into a WiFi hotspot. At an October 2018 press conference for the new entity VEECON ROK Kendrick donned literal rose-colored glasses as he explained that because his company was not “beholden to stockholders” it was able to give back more to its consumers and collaborators. In fact according to multiple sources Rokit had only secured a preliminary memorandum of understanding from its Indian partners and had nowhere near the wherewithal to accomplish the announced $5 billion infrastructure project to outfit 27 cities on the subcontinent with WiFi. Despite several follow-up meetings sources say none of the work ever went ahead.

Sports ‘Bat Signal’

Rokit's pricey sports deals coincided with this shift to phones and growing optimism within the company amid the India talks. First came the two-year $3.22 million with the Chargers a relatively inexpensive price to secure field naming rights to an NFL team followed by a four-year agreement with the Rockets worth at least $40 million.

DeJoria and Fertitta the Rockets owner had already known each other according to multiple people familiar with the relationship but the deal was led by Excel Sports Management the NBA team’s sales agency. A handful of other companies were in talks for the team’s patch one of the people said but Rokit offered the most money spoke often about overseas business and presented fun name synergy something no one else could. The deal was announced just two days before the start of the 2018-19 regular season. (A representative for Excel declined to comment.)

The Rockets deal turned heads across sports. Jersey patches were still relatively new in the NBA and each team’s first partnership generally drew a lot of media attention. That was heightened by the on-the-nose sponsor name and the team’s success—Rockets star James Harden was the reigning league MVP and the team had fallen one victory short of the previous season’s NBA Finals.

One global sponsorship consultant who was not part of a Rokit deal nonetheless described it as a “bat signal” to franchises across the U.S. that this particular company was both willing to spend big money and had already passed the vetting process for two of the world’s biggest teams. An executive who negotiated a Rokit deal later on said it would have been viewed as “potentially offensive” to more fully scrutinize the finances of a company that already had those deals in place.

Beyond the increased name recognition the company pushed to leverage its relationship with Fertitta into a much wider opportunity for its liquor business. Fertitta owns restaurant and hospitality giant Landry’s which has more than 600 properties in 36 states and more than 15 countries. (The Raiders deal also involved Rokit's liquor).

The Rockets’ agreement and subsequent sports deals gave the impression of a single company pushing hard into the space. But Rokit’s various legal battles and bankruptcy hearings show the group is composed of dozens of separate companies all with varying degrees of connection. The names of these companies are frequently subject to change making it difficult to decipher their financial and operational ties. In the bankruptcy proceedings Rokit is stressing the independence of each in contending that the buck should stop with the specific debtors.

Then again at certain times the enterprise has found it advantageous to assert their interrelatedness. For example in the summer of 2019 Rokit announced it was specifically changing the name of ROK Drinks to Rokit Drinks to “align [it] with the extensive sports sponsorship activities undertaken by its sister company Rokit Phones.”

Where Credit Is Due

In late July Kendrick called in to the first meeting of the creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings of Imply Industry Inc. a Rokit subsidiary doing business as ROK Brands Inc. which had been the party to the Raiders deal.

According to its bankruptcy petition ROK Brands Inc. claimed to have $13900 of assets and over $3.8 million of liabilities of which it attributed a nearly $2 million unsecured claim to the Raiders and another $500000 debt to Astound Group the marketing agency hired to promote the Rokit/Raiders partnership. (A representative for Astound declined to comment.)

In the initial 20-minute hearing during which neither the Raiders nor any other creditors appeared the Chapter 7 panel trustee Brian Ferguson expressed misgivings as to why the nearly assetless ROK Brands was the entity shouldering the full debt of the Raiders deal gone sideways.

In an audio recording of the meeting obtained by Sportico through a public records request Ferguson questioned whether other Rokit businesses under Kendrick’s purview benefited from the Raiders’ promotion and therefore should shoulder whatever money is owed to the team.

Kendrick explained that ROK Brands was a Rokit subsidiary created with the narrow purpose of selling its mobile phone devices to Walmart. In responding to Ferguson’s questioning Kendrick claimed Rokit’s deal to sponsor the Raiders was specifically “tailored” to meeting the reciprocal marketing commitments of its deal with Walmart which was presumed to be worth “tens of millions of dollars.” However this point neglected to address the other part of the Raiders deal which he acknowledged focused on Rokit’s alcohol. (Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.)

During the hearing Kendrick explained that ROK Brands Inc. had purchased “a lot of inventory” but sales of the phones were failing to meet projections even before the pandemic created a two-front “nightmare.”

“There were no games being played and we couldn’t get the phones made because of the [delays for] components” he said. “We basically couldn’t commit to that deal and I was trying to renegotiate it but nobody could give me a date when the games would start again. So that was a bit of a fiasco.” (The NFL canceled its 2020 preseason but played the regular season and playoffs as scheduled.)

In a follow-up meeting several weeks later J.R. Baxter a lawyer working for the Chapter 7 trustee asked Daniel Lewis a Rokit representative whether he knew of any subsequent agreements with the Raiders that released the debtor from liability. Lewis said he did not.

“So as far as you are aware the debtor still owes all the money to the Raiders [from] the contract?” Baxter reiterated.

“As far as I am aware yes” said Lewis. For now the Raiders have not formally indicated whether they plan to pursue this debt and Ferguson the trustee declined to comment for this story.

Touchdown Dances

While the ROK Brands bankruptcy was filed in the Western District of Arkansas where the subsidiary listed its offices Rokit’s five other pending bankruptcies are in the Central District of California where the company’s U.S. operations are based.

Radical West (aka Rokit Wireless) filed for bankruptcy last July claiming no assets and nearly $1 million of liabilities with a $400000 debt owed to the Chargers. This came after a breach of contract lawsuit the Chargers filed against Rokit Wireless and Kendrick individually in California state court. In August 2018 the team announced it had signed a deal for Rokit to be both its official wireless partner and the title sponsor of its field at what was then known as the StubHub Center. (A spokesperson for the Chargers declined to comment.)

Six months later Narrow Management Inc. (aka Skyrokit) filed for Chapter 7 claiming a $625000 unsecured debt to the Tennis Channel after a separate lawsuit in California.

Able Events Inc. which did business under the name Rokit Marketing Inc. filed for bankruptcy in March claiming over $70 million in liabilities and no assets. Its list of creditors included Williams Racing the Houston Rockets and Chargers star Derwin James who filmed a series of Rokit promotional videos where he teaches touchdown celebrations. The two-time Pro Bowl safety has zero career NFL touchdowns. (Representatives for Williams and James didn’t respond to requests for comment.)

In its petition Rokit Marketing also listed a nearly $9 million (£7 million) unsecured debt to Manchester United. The European soccer club was in talks with a Rokit-owned beer brand called ABK on a large partnership that never materialized according to someone familiar with the situation. A representative for Manchester United declined to comment.

Concurrent to Rokit Marketing Inc.’s bankruptcy another entity called ROK Marketing LLC filed for bankruptcy listing $15.5 million in liabilities owed almost entirely to Williams Racing. David Neale the attorney representing several of the Rokit entities did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The concert of Chapter 7 activity has come amid a series of adverse civil court and arbitration rulings against the company. Last October a British arbitrator ruled against Rokit in awarding Williams Racing what now is around $30 million (£26.2 million plus $1 million) including attorneys’ fees and the F1 team subsequently asked for a federal court in California to confirm the award in order to collect on it in the U.S.

Rokit Marketing and ROK Marketing’s bankruptcy filings came two weeks after a judge set the briefing schedule for the arbitral award action which stayed the case until early last month.

A Problem in Houston

The fallout from the Rokit-Houston Rockets deal has been especially contentious. In October 2018 Rokit Marketing Inc. entered into a four-year agreement for just under $10 million a year making Rokit the team’s first jersey patch sponsor. Rokit made good on its upfront payment for the first year according to court filings but then refused to pay the additional $500000 that the contract stipulated for the team making the second round of the playoffs that year.

In March 2020 the Houston Rockets filed for arbitration claiming that Rokit was by then behind on payments to the tune of $11.3 million. During the arbitration Rokit had argued in part that the company had suffered financially because Houston Rockets’ then-GM Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protest movement against China. Rokit claimed that Morey had by extension harmed its own business relationships in China where its mobile devices were being manufactured.

The arbitrator granted the Rockets their full award while tacking on $443000 in prejudgment interest and roughly $200000 in attorney’s fees. The arbiter’s ruling was quickly reaffirmed by an order from a Texas state court judge.

As the Rockets were seeking to recover their eight-figure judgment this May three Rokit subsidiaries—Rokit Drinks Rok Imports and their holding company Rok Stars Limited—filed a federal lawsuit against the Houston Rockets’ parent and sister companies Fertitta Entertainment Inc. and Landry’s Inc. The suit effectively argued that Rokit was entitled to bail on its jersey patch payments because Landry’s hadn’t held up its end of the bargain on a separate liquor distribution agreement.

According to the complaint in August 2018—the same month the Chargers partnership was announced—Kendrick met Fertitta at his Mastro’s steakhouse in Houston to hash out a beverage component to their budding relationship. Over lunch the suit states Fertitta personally conducted a blind taste test between Rokit’s Bogart Vodka and Tito’s favoring the former.

Rokit executed the beverage deal with Landry’s shortly thereafter but alleges that the restaurant group dragged its feet on purchasing the quantities of liquor it had indicated it would. By the summer of 2020 Rokit says it was forced to lay off a sizable chunk of its workforce and destroy a “substantial portion” of the alcohol it had produced and that the situation led to demise of its previously struck licensing deal with the Humphrey Bogart Estate. (An email sent to the Bogart estate wasn’t returned.)

“This lawsuit is a frivolous—bordering on unethical—attempt by Rokit Drinks to enforce an agreement that never existed and litigate contentions previously raised in an arbitration (which plaintiffs’ affiliates lost) but voluntarily dismissed” Landry’s and Fertitta Entertainment wrote in their motion to dismiss. The companies argued that Rokit’s explicit plan to induce an alcoholic beverage deal with Landry’s by sponsoring the Houston Rockets violates Texas’ alcoholic beverage laws.

A federal judge agreed to dismiss the case but allowed Rokit to file an amended complaint later this month. Keith French a Texas-based lawyer representing Rokit said the companies intend to do so. Representatives from the Rockets and Landry’s did not respond to requests for comment.

‘I Am Very Angry’

At the Arkansas bankruptcy creditors meeting in July Kendrick pooh-poohed the “friendly” ruling from the arbitrator in Texas chalking it up to the Rockets home-court advantage and laid into the organization’s ownership. “I am very angry with those guys” Kendrick said adding that in addition to the civil litigation he filed in the United States he planned to also pursue “criminal fraud” charges against Fertitta and company through the British court system. Sportico could find no record of Kendrick pursuing this litigation in the UK; when asked about it French said he had “no comment beyond the statements made by Mr. Kendrick.”

Pressed by Ferguson the bankruptcy trustee Kendrick estimated that his portfolio currently includes “about 60” companies worldwide.

“We’ve registered a lot of companies so we could protect the name so nobody else could grab it” Kendrick told Ferguson. “Some of those are connected and some are not.”

In its lawsuit against Rokit filed in August 2020 the Tennis Channel which added a “Rokit Shot of the Day” highlight segment in its broadcasts sought to establish the connection between the entity it had contracted with Skyrokit Inc. and the larger corporate creature it believed it was actually promoting. In the discovery process The Tennis Channel asked whether Skyrokit was a “member of ROKIT Group”; whether it used the “Rokit” logo; and whether Kendrick was the company’s CEO. The defendant issued denials for all three questions. The case was eventually settled late last year. Days later Skyrokit filed for bankruptcy listing its co-debtor as Rok Mobile Inc. and its biggest creditor as Rokit World Inc. (The Tennis Channel which is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group declined to comment.)

In May 2019 Rokit announced a series of sponsorships with some of the world’s top tennis players including Gael Monfils Stan Wawrinka Danielle Collins and Sam Querrey all of whom began wearing the company’s logo during matches.

“Everything started off fine but it quickly became clear they didn’t really have a great plan on how to activate the sponsorships within sports” John Tobias Querrey’s agent said in an email. “Within six months payments were late or not made at all … We agreed to take 30% of what was still due just to move on.”

Earlier this year A.J. Foyt Racing announced that the No. 11 car shared by Tatiana Calderón and JR Hildebrand would no longer participate in IndyCar races until its primary sponsor Rokit made up for missed payments. Neither driver has raced since. (Larry Foyt president of A.J. Foyt Racing declined to comment).

A few months before the car was sidelined Rokit filed a lawsuit which it lost against a production company over footage used in a documentary about Calderón. The production company claimed in its response that the lawsuit was an attempt to front-run their own potential breach-of-contract claim.

The most recent publicly available financial statements filed by two of Rokit’s main holding companies—Rokit Launch Limited and Rok Stars Limited—portrayed an overall enterprise in arrears. In 2020 Rokit Launch Limited which comprises several mobile phone product and service companies reported losses of around $8 million. The company disclosed it had yet to pay back any of the $100 million in loans it received from its two co-founders with the bulk of those nearly $80 million coming from DeJoria.

ROK Stars Limited the liquor holding company and its subsidiaries turned a profit of $960000 (£868000) in 2020 according to its audited financials up from a loss of $2.69 million (£2.43 million) in 2019. The group had $24.2 million (£21.86 million) in debt with the bulk of those liabilities also owing to a loan by DeJoria. “These conditions along with other matters … may cast significant doubt about the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern” the company’s British auditor wrote in a report to its shareholders in September 2021.

ROK Stars was once traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange the largest in Germany which it said it left in 2012 following a rule change. The company was then traded on the Stuttgart Stock Exchange until June 2020 when it was delisted. The company said at the time that the listing termination was initiated by the exchange and that it chose not to submit a new application citing low trading volume and access to other sources of funding.

‘Red Flags’

While more recent financial reports are not yet available one former Rokit drinks employee who spoke to Sportico on the condition of anonymity says that the liquor venture was a continual source of bemusement to those tasked with selling the product.

“The red flags primarily were the amount of sales we were doing and how [well] we were getting paid and wondering where the money was coming from” said the former employee who left the group earlier this year. “We were barely selling anything in the whole country. The numbers just don’t add up.”

From 2020 to 2021 Rokit’s U.S.-based entities received over $1.3 million in forgiven paycheck protection loans according to Small Business Administration data compiled by ProPublica.

Though the Chapter 7 process offers protections such as staying litigation Bruce Markell a former U.S. bankruptcy judge and professor at Northwestern Law School says that it also invites the risk of added scrutiny.

“If you are going to bury somebody there are cheaper funerals than Chapter 7” said Markell noting that bankruptcy trustees are both empowered and motivated to hold company’s directors personally liable in instances where there have been fraudulent transfers of assets or undercapitalized subsidiaries. Trustees work on a commission system in which they earn a percentage of any additional monies they are able to claw back for creditors.

“If the companies don’t have assets there are no downsides to letting the vultures pick over them” Markell added. “If you file bankruptcy you just appointed someone who is putting a microscope on you and has a financial incentive to do so.”

That said the Rokit corporate veil so far remains unpierced. Will that soon change?

After numerous delays the creditors meetings for several of the California bankruptcies are scheduled to take place in mid-October followed a few weeks later by a continuation of the creditors meeting in the Arkansas bankruptcy. With its bankruptcy stay now lifted Williams Racing is finally set to get a hearing for its Rokit arbitral award in late November.

Rokit's future may hinge entirely on DeJoria's willingness to remain involved with the money-losing venture. Why DeJoria has stayed with it this long is a question that's mystified a number of people who worked inside and in partnership with the company.

On July 12 a week before the Arkansas bankruptcy creditors’ meeting Kendrick was awarded an honorary doctorate of business administration at the University of Bolton in Manchester England.

Taking the podium Kendrick regaled the assembled auditorium of students with the tale of his boom-and-bust business career that led to Rokit. It began he said when he “talked my way” into his first job at Goodyear as a 17-year-old orphan and became a millionaire tire entrepreneur by 24. He would lose most of his gains four years later Kendrick explained the first of several times that happened. Now on his “third fortune” Kendrick held himself out as a model of hard work and fearlessness in the face of failure.

He concluded the remarks with the mantra he says he speaks to himself when he rises each morning: “Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not prepared to do.”

The owner of one of the largest office properties in Philadelphia is seeking more time from its lender to stabilize its performance.

The joint venture of Nightingale Properties and Wafra Capital Partners that owns Centre Square is seeking a second extension on its $368M loan backed by the 1.8M SF two-building complex at 1500 Market St. the Philadelphia Business Journal reports. Nightingale operates the buildings on behalf of the JV. Neither company responded to requests for comment.

After purchasing Centre Square from Equity Commonwealth for $328M in 2017 Nightingale and Wafra refinanced with a $388M loan provided by JPMorgan Chase in 2019 which has since been packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities PBJ reports. Midland Loan Services has been acting as the servicer for the loan and KeyBank National Association has been the special servicer for Centre Square since the loan was placed on a CMBS watchlist in April 2020.

Remote work has punched a hole in the value of office properties in Philadelphia despite the return of Comcast's office workers (for three days a week) in September. Along with Charlotte and Houston Philly was named as a hotspot of distress for office assets in an Oct. 5 report by credit monitoring firm Trepp.

Counting the University of Pennsylvania Health System Saul Ewing LLP Public Health Management and Dilworth Paxson as its largest tenants Centre Square was 69% occupied at the end of last year when its loan was originally scheduled to mature PBJ reports. The JV's first extension extended the maturity date to the end of this year; the loan's terms allow for a total of three extensions.

Contributing to the low occupancy have been a number of large exits led by insurance firm Willis Towers Watson departing over 244K SF and Comcast vacating 90K SF. Radian another insurance firm is departing its 173K SF space in Centre Square by next April and subleasing it until the lease expires in 2024 PBJ reports. Law firm Rawle & Henderson has signed a sublease for 36K SF of Radian's footprint.

Built in 1974 Centre Square seems to be losing out in the flight to quality being experienced in office markets across the country despite Nightingale undertaking a multimillion-dollar renovation to the lobby and common spaces since acquiring the property.

Insurance giant Chubb has agreed to occupy a build-to-suit headquarters to be developed by Parkway Corp. a few blocks northwest of Centre Square even as office occupancy in Philly reached a 10-year high in the third quarter according to CoStar data reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtYXJ0YnJpZWYuY29tL29yaWdpbmFsL2xlYWQtd2l0aC1sb3Zl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lead with love,"Love may seem out of place in a business context but it’s actually a key leadership quality today.

Transcript: Lead with love

What do you think is the most important leadership quality? Competence? Vision? Integrity?

I would like to suggest that it’s Love. In today’s business environment leaders must demonstrate love for their employees.

I don’t mean love as in a touchy-feely warm and fuzzy emotion or a romantic feeling. I’m talking about love in the sense of a sincere and sacrificial care and concern for others. And for leaders this posture is needed now more than ever.

These days employees don’t trust their managers much less feel cared for by them. The Institute of Internal Communication reports that only 63% of employees — less than two-thirds — think the leadership of their organization genuinely cares about them. According to the Predictive Index nearly a quarter (24%) of employees believe their managers would undermine their efforts. And that’s no wonder when you consider that O.C. Tanner reports 65% of employees say they weren’t recognized for their work even once last year.

3 ways to lead with love

So what does leading with love entail? First and most importantly is taking the time to get to know your employees personally. This will require a sacrificial investment of time on your part but you can’t love someone you don’t know so make it a priority to be with your people. If possible do it one-on-one. It’s best if there’s no agenda other than to get to know each other. And remember God gave you two ears but only one mouth for a reason — do more listening than talking.

Second demonstrate love for your employees by trusting them. If you want employees to trust you you must trust them first because trust is earned. So expect your employees to do the right thing give them the benefit of the doubt and empower them to do their best work. That means establishing targets and providing training coaching and role-modeling — and then getting out of the way.

And finally leading with love involves being concerned about your employees as whole persons — caring about their overall well-being not only their contribution to the business. Of course in the end you need everyone working toward your business goals. But you’re not going to get there if your employees aren’t healthy physically mentally emotionally and relationally. And with nearly all employees (86%) reporting in a recent Willis Towers Watson study that mental health stress and burnout is still a priority you can’t afford to assume that everyone is just fine.

One of my favorite examples of leading with love comes from former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. After Indra became CEO her parents held a reception in her honor at their home in India. As people streamed in to congratulate her parents about Indra’s accomplishment she recognized how meaningful it was for her parents to be acknowledged and how it made her feel. So she started a practice of writing personal letters to the parents of her direct reports to thank them for the “gift” of their children. This message of appreciation for her employees not only prompted emotional responses from their parents but conveyed to employees a personal sincere and whole-person care. In other words love.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2NzYy1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW9mZmVycy1idXktYmFzc2V0dC0xMjAwMDA3MjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSC Generation offers to buy Bassett Furniture for $21 a share -letter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

NEW YORK Oct 11 (Reuters) - Retail sector holding company CSC Generation Inc wants to buy Bassett Furniture for roughly $191 million and is offering a 27% premium to take the company private according to a letter seen by Reuters.

CSC Generation one of Bassett's top ten shareholders with a with a 2% stake at the end of June made the offer to buy the home furnishings retailer for $21 a share in cash late last month.

""We believe transformation is needed at Bassett and that a successful outcome can only be executed as a private business with the additional resources of a digitally native owner"" the letter said. CSC general counsel Elizabeth Brown wrote the letter dated Oct. 11 to the Bassett board.

Bassett's share price has fallen roughly 10% in the last 52 weeks and has lost almost 60% of its value in the last five years prompting CSC whose brands include Sur La Table and One Kings Lane to approach the company.

""We believe that the company's stock has traded at a substantial discount to its true value for the past four years and will continue to trade below its intrinsic value if it remains publicly listed"" Brown added in the letter.

CSC has spent the last several months trying to engage with Bassett's board Brown said in the letter.

A representative for Bassett was not immediately available for comment.

CSC Generation was founded six years ago by Justin Yoshimura and has used its digital capabilities and improved operations at store and catalog retailers to build methods of shopping that include online in-store and phone purchases.

The investor is intent on receiving a fair evaluation of its offer and said it would ""take any action necessary"" to achieve its goal. Last month it was rebuffed by smaller furniture company Flexsteel Industries which it wanted to buy and whose stock price has tumbled more than 10% since the company announced plans to reject CSC.

Mergers and acquisition activity has slowed as financing conditions have tightened in the wake of high inflation rising interest rates and a more uncertain outlook for growth. Global dealmaking slowed to 210 deals completed in the third quarter compared with 264 deals in the same quarter a year ago according to data from consulting firm Willis Towers Watson.

Showgirls stabbed in a brazen Las Vegas Strip attack on Thursday denied they were making fun of their assailant before he attacked them.

As Victoria Cayetano and Maris DiGiovanni worked together that Thursday morning on the Strip the final morning of DiGiovanni’s life they posed for a selfie taken by Cayetano.

Both women were smiling and wearing showgirl costumes. DiGiovanni held a $100 bill.

Not long after both would be stabbed by a knife-wielding man who went on a sudden rampage on the busy Strip with eight victims in total the Metropolitan Police Department said. Police would arrest the man and identify him as Yoni Barrios 32.

Cayetano stabbed in the shoulder survived. DiGiovanni stabbed in the chest did not. Brent Hallett 47 of Alberta Canada was also killed.

In a Facetime interview on Monday Cayetano 19 recounted her harrowing experiences that morning just before noon on the Strip by the pedestrian bridge in front of the Wynn Las Vegas resort.

“I was just shocked that this was happening that we were getting chased by someone with a knife” Cayetano said.

Cheryl Lowthorp owns Best Showgirls in Vegas the company that employed DiGiovanni 30 and continues to employ the surviving women who posed as showgirls. Lowthorp is now trying to raise money through a GoFundMe to cover the survivors’ medical bills and other expenses.

None of the 50 or so women who work for the company was working as of Monday Lowthorp said.

“We’re closed because the girls are terrified” Lowthorp said.

Lowthorp’s fundraising goal for the GoFundMe page she created called the “Las Vegas showgirl recovery fund” is to raise $250000. The effort had raised more than $21000 by Monday afternoon.

A separate GoFundMe set up to help DiGiovanni’s family cover funeral expenses travel arrangements and other costs had raised more than $58000 by Monday afternoon.

“She was very bright all the times that I worked with her” Cayetano said of DiGiovanni. “She never had a frown on her face.”

Resort disputes account

A spokesperson for Wynn Resorts disputed what Barrios told police about his interaction with a security guard at the Wynn just before the stabbing spree when Barrios allegedly told the guard he was trying to sell knives to get enough money to go back home according to his Metro arrest report.

“The security guard told Barrios to jump in front of a train” the arrest report said.

Wynn through its spokesperson disputed that account.

“The comment attributed to our security officer by the assailant in Thursday’s incident is false” wrote Michael Weaver chief communications and brand officer of Wynn Resorts in an email.

“After being interviewed by both Las Vegas Metro and our own internal investigators we believe our officer responded responsibly to the assailant given the limited information available to him and an interaction lasting less than 30 seconds” Weaver said.

Before his exchange with the security guard Barrios also spoke with a janitor about possible job openings and asked the janitor to contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement so that he could be returned home to Guatemala.

Lowthorp Westby and Cayetano also disputed what Barrios allegedly told police claims that Barrios thought the women were “laughing at him and making fun of his clothing.” All three said those claims were ridiculous and untrue.

“There was not a single moment where he was provoked” Anna Westby another woman dressed as a showgirl who was stabbed but survived said to reporters in a video phone call from her hospital bed on Saturday night. “No there was no making fun of anyone.”

Sudden stabbing

Cayetano remembered the interaction in much the same way as Westby in an interview she gave to reporters Saturday night: that a man approached four women posing as showgirls and asked to have his picture taken with them but then pulled out a large black knife that was wrapped in a piece of cloth.

Perplexed and alarmed the girls eyed each other warily. Suddenly the man plunged the knife into DiGiovanni’s chest.

They all started to run. DiGiovanni collapsed. The man chased them. He stabbed Westby in the back and Cayetano in the shoulder. Another woman named Selina who Lowthorp said wants to maintain her privacy and didn’t want to give her name or do any media interviews managed to escape without being stabbed.

DiGiovanni was taken to University Medical Center but died.

“She was an amazing human being” Lowthorp said. “This was an amazing soul.”

Barrios according to police kept on running and stabbing knifing five other people.

Citing state law police redacted the surviving victims’ names from the arrest report. But another GoFundMe identifies Gabrielle “Gabby” Hewes and sister Cassandra “Cassy” Hewes as two of the other victims stabbed in the attacks.

“The family is now facing missed work hotel expenses as well as travel expenses to be with the girls in Las Vegas” the GoFundMe page says. As of Monday evening it had raised almost $13000.

Barrios faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of murder and was ordered held without bail in a court appearance Friday. He appeared briefly in court on Tuesday and a public defender was appointed to represent him.

Police said 32-year-old Yoni Barrios stabbed eight people killing two men Thursday. Sisters Gabrielle Hewes 24 and Cassandra Hewes 21 were in Las Vegas on a 'girls trip' with their mom when they were attacked.

Local news station KSNV reported that the sisters were posing for photos with some showgirls outside the Wynn Las Vegas resort when Barrios approached the group with a knife. At first Barrios wanted to take a picture with the showgirls with the knife. He told police that he attacked the showgirls because he thought the women were laughing at him.



Family members said Cassandra Hewes has been released from the hospital but is ""traumatized"" and is ""afraid to go outside."" Gabrielle Hewes is still in intensive care at a Las Vegas hospital but is not longer on a ventilator family members said. They said they are taking her recovery ""day by day.""

Gabrielle Hewes was planning for a wedding next year the family said.

Learn about some of the strategies that are helping utilities reduce emissions in Xylem's new paper. (Graphic: Business Wire)

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--More than 80 water and wastewater utilities worldwide have set net-zero and climate-neutrality targets.1 These utilities are leading the decarbonization of the water sector with strategies that optimize operations while cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A new paper from global water technology company Xylem (NYSE: XYL) Net Zero: The Race We All Win shows how water managers are reducing their emissions and making infrastructure more resilient to climate change.

“We have an opportunity to help the water sector be the fastest to reduce its carbon emission footprint. Utilities already on the frontlines of the effects of climate change and aging infrastructure and passionate public servants are the key” said Patrick Decker President and CEO of Xylem. “This paper and action show how leading water utility managers are delivering real progress toward net-zero goals. And these examples show how quickly and affordably they are doing it while optimizing their overall operations. The technology exists to address these challenges and the time to make a difference is now.”

Water infrastructure accounts for approximately 2% of global GHG emissions – the same as the global shipping industry. Net Zero: The Race We All Win which is available to download highlights pragmatic approaches and proven technologies that can reduce water utility emissions to net zero. The methods used by pace-setting utilities include:

Create a smart net zero strategy – realistic measurable targets towards emissions-reduction goals

Optimize energy and resources across a network – cost-neutral strategies to reduce emissions while ensuring process stability

Embed net-zero goals in capital planning – net-zero criteria that fold into existing processes and the flow of day-to-day decision-making

Move from treatment to resource recovery – from wastewater as a by-product to be managed to a resource

Among the success stories highlighted in the paper is the City of South Bend Indiana. The city used technology to reduce combined sewer overflow volume by more than 70 percent. This prevented needless construction of new grey infrastructure and eliminated the associated embedded carbon. The city improved system performance and capacity utilization and delivered environmental gains 10 to 15 years ahead of schedule.

“While the headline figure of our work was that the city has saved approximately $500 million in capital work savings the impact on our carbon footprint should not be overlooked. By avoiding a large construction project and prolonging the life or our infrastructure through smart technology we have made a major impact in reducing our carbon footprint” said Kieran Fahey Director Long-Term Control Plan at the Department of Public Works City of South Bend.

In another example EWE WASSER GmbH (EWE) in Cuxhaven one of Germany’s largest wastewater companies reduced energy use by 30 percent in part of its operations. Its plant has the capacity to treat wastewater for 400000 people and the reductions saved 1.1 million kWh annually enough energy to power 275 homes for one year while ensuring high water quality.

Xylem executives will be leading decarbonization conversations at WEFTEC 2022 and European Energy Efficiency Day this week and at the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt next month.

Xylem was named “Net Zero Carbon Champion” at the 2022 Global Water Awards. This award recognized the Company’s work to accelerate the decarbonization of the water sector and its pledge to partner with utilities businesses and water managers around the world to help reduce their carbon footprint. It also acknowledged the Company’s commitments in sustainability: in the last two years the Company has already reduced the CO2 footprint of its water customers by over 1 million metric tons.

As Elon Musk unveiled a prototype of Tesla's Optimus bot he promised the humanoid would one day change the way people live and work — but some experts are less optimistic.

AI researcher Filip Piekniewski told Insider the robot ""doesn't stand out from other similar projects"" after tweeting that Tesla's AI Day last month was ""next level cringeworthy"" and a ""complete and utter scam."" Meanwhile Melonee Wise VP of Robotics Automation at Zebra Technologies said the device appeared ""well behind"" other tech companies including Boston Dynamics.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""There is nothing particularly surprising about it and every company with sufficient budget could put together similar demo in a few months"" Piekniewski said.

Piekniewski said the robot doesn't ""stack up against the claims made by Elon Musk"" that it will revolutionize the work environment. Musk has said the bots could eventually replace factory workers and could even serve as caregivers.

But Piekniewski cast doubt on those claims. ""Robots don't have anything even remotely close to a brain"" he said. ""Yes you can get them to perform simple tasks and exhibit superficial levels of situational awareness but it takes just one detail to be out of what is expected and the robot will quickly descend into a series of mistakes that will typically end with unrecoverable disaster.""

Davide Scaramuzza director of the Robotics and Perception Group at the University of Zurich said the robot demonstration was ""better than expected"" but only because last year Tesla revealed its plans for a humanoid robot with a man dressed up in a robot costume.

This year at Tesla's second annual AI Day a prototype of the Optimus bot walked slowly onto the stage and waved to the audience. Musk said it was the first time the bot had walked ""without any support."" The billionaire also presented another prototype that looked closer to production but it had to be wheeled on stage by several workers.

""The robot can actually do a lot more than we showed you we just didn't want it to fall on its face"" Musk told spectators. He promised the bot will one day cost less than $20000 and said the carmaker hopes to start taking orders for it within the next three to five years — both plans experts said are feasible but depending on your expectations for the robot.

""Building a robot to be used in the real world is much more difficult than most may think"" said Dennis Hong a engineering and robotics professor at University of California Los Angeles. ""I do not believe we will have humanoid butler robots that can do the dishes take out the trash and do our grocery shopping anytime soon. But starting with something much simpler I am cautiously optimistic.""

A demo video at the event also showed the bot picking up and carrying boxes in Tesla's Fremont California factory as well as watering plants.

Christian Hubicki a robotics professor at Florida State University and Scaramuzza the professor at the University of Zurich both told Insider the live demonstration seemed heavily scripted and controlled. Cynthia Yeung head of product at Plus One Robotics said the bot was either pre-programmed to run the routine or tele-operated.

""If the objects would be moved by an inch the robot would not be able to grasp them anymore"" Scaramuzza said noting he believes Tesla is more than a decade away from a robot that could perform better than a human worker.

The Optimus bot did stand out in one way according to several experts — its hands. Animesh Garg a professor of AI Robotics at the University of Toronto called the bot's hands ""impressive."" Hubicki noted the superior dexterity of the robot's hands could give the humanoid robot an advantage on other robots like Boston Dynamics' Atlas when it comes to gripping ""smaller and more complex objects.""

The Discount Tire Pit Pass concept is a new retail experience designed to integrate technologies including embedded tire scanners digital displays online ordering and appointment-focused booking with speedy tire and wheel services from the comfort of a customer’s vehicle in a drive-thru experience.

Discount Tire announced the Atlanta metro area as the location of its first Pit Pass concept store.

The initial Discount Tire Pit Pass concept store is in Flowery Branch Georgia just south of the intersection of Interstate 985 and Highway 53.

The Discount Tire Pit Pass concept store features an approximate 5000-square-foot ground floor footprint and 2600 square feet of subsurface workspace and is markedly different from the traditional tire shop.

As customers enter a drive-thru lane with a covered canopy they are greeted by a Discount Tire employee to confirm the services scheduled and are then guided by the employee and digital displays to one of three bays.

Similar to a racetrack pit crew and fully visible to the customer Discount Tire’s expert technicians are using the latest technologies including embedded tire scanners that evaluate tread depth and tire condition and Zebra mobile devices to complete services.

Digital displays give each customer’s vehicle status in real time and allow tire technicians to share updates and product or service recommendations. The entire experience will enable customers the option to remain in their vehicle.

“Our goal is to meet the busy lifestyle of today’s modern customer and get them taken care of faster and with more personal convenience” said Tom Williams chief experience officer at Discount Tire. “The new Pit Pass concept store is a great testament to innovation that follows putting the customer first just as we have done for decades to offer an inviting easy and safe experience.”

Customers visiting the Discount Tire Pit Pass concept store are encouraged to shop for tires and wheels online and to book an appointment in advance using the Discount Tire mobile app or DiscountTire.com to save time.

Customers who prefer to shop on-site can visit the Discount Tire Pit Pass concept store drive over the embedded tire scanners and receive information about their tires’ condition.

The digital displays in the drive-thru experience give customers access to Discount Tire’s exclusive tire guide Treadwell which can provide customers with a self-guided experience and the same personalized recommendation they would receive from an associate.

Discount Tire’s Pit Pass concept store also offers a new experience for customers who need their tire pressure checked.

With after-hours functionality customers can receive a digital readout of their tire conditions from the displays in the drive-thru experience and make informed decisions about tire maintenance replacement or scheduling a service appointment.

“The expansion of the buy-online trend for tire and wheel purchases creates an opportunity to test new ways to meet the changing needs customers expect today. Pit Pass allows us to meet these needs and potentially change the traditional tire wheel and service experience moving forward” said Williams.

The wrongdoing reportedly came to light when a Brazilian former orthopedic surgeon provided an anonymous tip to the company and then to the SEC. That won the whistleblower a $4.5 million reward from the US regulatory agency.

The bounty was authorized by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act which offers such whistleblowers 10–30 percent of cash funds collected from enforcement actions that top $1 million. Some critics question whether this provision is a good idea. A Bloomberg investigation recently found that the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program “often ignores its own rules shields much of its work from the public and has been a financial boon for law firms that hired former agency officials.”

But the program does effectively deter financial fraud according to Chicago Booth’s Philip G. Berger and City University of New York’s Heemin Lee (a graduate of Booth’s PhD Program). Their research finds that the Dodd-Frank whistleblower provision has reduced the likelihood of corporate financial fraud by 12–22 percent depending on how the calculations are done without significantly affecting audit fees.

Whistleblower laws have a long history. In 1863 when Civil War profiteers were effectively robbing the public purse the US Congress pushed through the False Claims Act offering rewards to whistleblowers. Over time lawmakers have broadened the application of the bounty incentive—and thus increased the number of people coming to regulators with allegations of wrongdoing.

In the first 10 years of the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program the number of tips to the Securities and Exchange Commission rose steadily to more than 52000 the researchers report citing the SEC’s 2021 annual report to Congress. The SEC has collected almost $5 billion in sanctions and handed out more than $1.1 billion in bounties to 214 whistleblowers. But those data don’t really prove whether the program provides a deterrent and “studying detected fraud does not tell us how much undetected fraud is occurring” the researchers observe.

Because detected fraud could represent just a fraction of the greater problem Berger and Lee focus instead on an indicator of the probability of fraud known as the F-score developed in 2011 by University of Southern California’s Patricia M. Dechow and her coresearchers. Berger and Lee argue that the measure provides a reasonable approximation of underlying fraud. The F-score reflects financial-statement data showing accrual quality business performance and external financing measures. Higher scores signal a greater probability of accounting misstatements.

The other big research challenge was coming up with a before-and-after comparison for businesses likely to be affected by Dodd-Frank. Berger and Lee used false-claims laws passed in 17 states before Dodd-Frank which reward whistleblowers who provide evidence of securities fraud by companies whose stocks are part of state pension-fund portfolios. (In 1987 California passed a false claims act with a whistleblower provision and others eventually followed.) These state laws incentivized companies to tighten up their accounting and take anti-fraud measures prior to the existence of the federal program thus presenting a good opportunity for comparison with companies for which Dodd-Frank was their first exposure to whistleblower liability the researchers argue.

When they analyzed the financial reports of more than 1800 companies from 2008 to 2014 (before and after the passage of Dodd-Frank) they find that companies subject to the state-level laws saw F-scores decline by 12 percent between 2008 and 2010. The research suggests that the drop in the probability of fraud resulted from companies being exposed to a state program during this time period either because of a newly implemented law or because a state pension plan invested in the companies. Businesses in the group that hadn’t had to worry about state whistleblower laws lowered their F-scores by even more—up to 22 percent—once Dodd-Frank went into effect the researchers find.

Berger and Lee note that little has been known about the effectiveness of Dodd-Frank’s whistleblowing provision and their work is the first to link such legislation to the probability of deterring corporate fraud.

“We contribute to the policy debate around the bounty model of whistleblowing by providing one crucial piece of evidence for the debate (quantification of the fraud reduction benefit)” Berger and Lee write. The findings suggest that whistleblower programs are effective in “motivating managers to prevent and avoid fraud” they conclude.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvb3J0aG9maXgtc2Vhc3BpbmUtY29tYmluZS03MDBtLW9ydGhvcGVkaWNzLWdpYW50LWFsbC1zdG9jay1tZXJnZXItZXF1YWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orthofix SeaSpine to combine into $700M orthopedics player in merger of equals,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/orthofix-seaspine-combine-700m-orthopedics-giant-all-stock-merger-equals on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvb3J0aG9maXgtc2Vhc3BpbmUtY29tYmluZS03MDBtLW9ydGhvcGVkaWNzLWdpYW50LWFsbC1zdG9jay1tZXJnZXItZXF1YWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NkZXZpY2UuY29tL2FzY2Vuc2lhLXNlbnNlb25pY3MtZXZlcnNlbnNlLWUzLWV1cm9wZWFuLWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ascensia completes Senseonics Eversense E3 European launch,"Ascensia Diabetes Care announced that it successfully completed its initial European launch for the Senseonics (NYSE:SENS) Eversense E3.

Just 23% of the top executives at the world’s 100 largest medical device companies are women according to an analysis of Medical Design & Outsourcing‘s annual Big 100 ranking of the top revenue-generating medtech companies.

While that number is up 2 percentage points from 2021 the average composition within the top 100 companies is also up slightly to 22%.

This year has been one of the most formative for women in leadership roles. There were 50 new C-suite appointments. However 2020 seemingly started the shift in leadership diversity. That year 37 women moved into C-suite roles in the top 100 companies followed by 34 new appointments in 2021. Overall women have moved into 121 new roles in the last three years.

“The fact that the management teams are now tapping into this in 2020 and 2021 are incredibly formative because life changed. Women want to make a change and companies need to react to that” Marissa Fayer the incoming CEO of women’s health company DeepLook Medical told MDO. “They need to be more accepting and flexible and adaptive to all types of people including women.”

Our analysis uses information from leadership pages on corporate websites as well as their executives’ LinkedIn pages.

Prevalence and composition of women in C-suite roles ticks up

Of the 942 leadership roles at the top companies 219 were held by women for an average composition of 22% within each company.

Just 10 companies listed no women in leadership roles as of Sept. 15. That’s three fewer than in 2021. Those companies include:

Bruker (0/6)

Nikkiso (0/6)

Agfa-Gevaert (0/5)

Masimo (0/5)

Drager (0/5)

Demant (0/4)

JMS Co. (0/4)

Carl Zeiss Meditec (0/3)

Medacta (0/3)

Artivion (0/1)

The leading women at the 100 largest medical device companies in the world have titles that break down into the following roles: human resources (48) regulatory (39) divisional presidents (38) finance (37) medical (20) general counsel/legal (19) information (14) communications/public affairs (13) marketing (eight) operations (eight) corporate secretary (four) R&D (two) manufacturing (two) and chief of staff (one). Note that some leaders hold one title for multiple roles such as “SVP general counsel and corporate secretary.”

Companies with the highest percentage of female executives are Dentsply Sirona Haemonetics and Ambu each with a 50% composition of women in C-suite roles. At Dentsply Sirona women have held those roles on average for one year compared to 2.25 years at Haemonetics and less than one year at Ambu.

Leadership diversity “makes the business much more profitable effective and creates better products. From the design standpoint you will have diverse people looking at how to make something and clinically evaluating it” Gabi Niederauer president and CEO of Bluegrass Vascular Technologies told MDO.

Among the top 20 medical device companies in the world women hold an above-average percentage of leadership roles at 26% which is one percentage point higher than 2021’s tally. However the average time spent in those positions is just three years.

Few companies have women in the top office

Six companies have women as CEOs: GN Hearing Barco Ambu B. Braun Melsungen Paul Hartmann and Accuray. Within those five companies women hold varying percentages of executive roles. Women account for 50% of C-suite positions at Ambu 40% at B. Braun Melsungen 33.3% at GN Hearing 13.3% at Barco and 12.5% at Accuray.

The number of women CEOs is up one from last year as women CEOs took over at Ambu and Accuray while Insulet’s former CEO Shacey Petrovich stepped down on June 1.

New Ambu CEO Britt Meelby Jensen was previously CEO of Atos Medical prior to its acquisition by Coloplast. Ambu listed no women in leadership roles on their website in 2021 so having it led by a woman just one year later is a big step toward diversifying its decision-making team.

“Progress is not being made fast enough” Fayer said. “There are amazing incredible women who are looking for different and new executive positions in the life science space and in the healthcare industry.”

A note on our methodology: We use each company’s leadership/management pages on their website to count top executives at each company. We do not include directors or board members.
