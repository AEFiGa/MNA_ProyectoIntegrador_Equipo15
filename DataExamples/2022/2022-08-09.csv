Babagana Zulum of Borno has approved the release of N19.3m for the immediate payment of scholarship allowances to 59 indigent students that gained admission into law schools.

The Executive Secretary of the Borno State Scholarship Board Mallam Bala Isa made this known on Tuesday in Maiduguri while addressing newsmen.

Bala said the scholarship was for the 2021/2022 academic year.

“This is part of His Excellency’s commitment in assisting the educational sector and in assisting students of Borno at all levels of education.

“We are grateful to His Excellency for this support and we believe that the students will put in their best in order to make Borno proud” Isa said.

Justice I.A.Yusuf of the Kwara State High Court ordered the remand of the suspect on Wednesday in Ilorin the state capital.

The remand order was sequel to Bala’s arraignment by the Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC on one count charge of criminal diversion of funds contrary to Section 308 of the Penal Code and punishable under Section 309 of the same Penal Code.

The charge reads: “That you Amedari Halilu Bala on or about 1st day of July 2022 at Ilorin Kwara State within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court did dishonestly convert to your personal use the sum of N3300000 property of Abdullahi Bello and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 308 of the Penal Code and punishable under Section 309 of the same law”.

The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Following his plea counsel to the EFCC Sesan Ola urged the court to fix a trial date for the prosecution to prove its case and remand the defendant in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Centre pending trial.

The Teessiders struck a deal worth in the region of £3m last week to bring the 21-year-old USA striker to the Riverside as exclusively revealed. The former Schalke man has opted to move to Boro ahead of rival interest from Sunderland. And having already also agreed personal terms over his move Boro were left with one hurdle left to clear.

That was the successful application for a work permit for the Californian-born star. However sources have indicated to TEAMtalk that this has now been granted freeing up Chris Wilder’s side to announce the signing.

Now an announcement is being prepped by Boro with Hoppe – who has six caps and one goal for his country – in the region and ready to begin work for his new club.

As such that could even be announced in time for Hoppe to potentially make his debut this weekend. Wilder’s side host his former club Sheffield United at the Riverside in what should be a keenly-fought contest.

Boro have started the season poorly with just one point from their first two games. As such they will see the match on Sunday as a real chance to give their season a lift-off.

Hoppe’s arrival should certainly help them towards that.

Wilder has been keen to add more firepower to his ranks after recognising that as an area of weakness last season.

Boro hoping for goals from Matthew Hoppe

Their top scorer in the Championship last season was Matt Crooks who managed just 10 goals. As such Wilder has been intent on strengthening their options up front.

Boro have already brought in Danish striker Mikkel Forss from Brentford. The 23-year-old has made one goal so far to his name scoring on his debut in the 3-2 defeat at QPR.

Adding Hoppe to the ranks will give Wilder genuine options up front as they look to mount a promotion push.

The Californian will also be hoping to fare better on Teesside than he did in Mallorca.

He departs the LaLiga side after just one season failing to score in his five appearances them. However only one of those appearances was from the start and he did at least manage an assist.

Hoppe however will be hoping life on Teesside is more to his liking.

Hoppe will also be the second American to sign for Middlesbrough this transfer window.

A sprawling home with stunning gardens that border National Trust woodland set in one of the region's most sought after postcodes has gone on the market.

The architect-designed residence on Thorsway in Caldy is known as The Four Winds and dates back to the 1930s.

All fittings and furniture in the house from its floors to the staircase and doors were custom made by Beyond Bespoke.

The lower ground floor comprises a games room cinema and gym. And if that wasn't enough luxury the double glazed windows are actually self-cleaning.

There are five bedrooms on the first floor the majority of which are en-suite. Two of the bedrooms boast balconies and the master has a large dressing room. The sixth bedroom is housed within a self-contained 'granny flat' or guest suite downstairs.

However the rear of the property is the real selling point. The garden has an extensive terrace set over two levels with stairs leading to the lawn.

The area is not overlooked offering utmost privacy and shares a border with acres of National Trust woodland on Caldy Hill. There is also a lower terrace with ornamental pond and rockery.

The Four Winds is being marketed by Bradshaw Farnham & Lea for an asking price of £2.95m. It was transformed by architect Trevor Irvin of West Kirby.

The last time The Four Winds changed hands was in 2008 for £2.3m. The time before that was in 2002 for just £575000.

Properties on Thorsway had an overall average price of £1.4m in the last year and increase of 5%.

Abbott dares NYC Mayor Adams to 'make my day' in migrant war,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tapped into his inner “Dirty Harry” on Wednesday and publicly dared Mayor Eric Adams to “make my day” by carrying through on his threat to send New Yorkers to campaign against his re-election bid.

Abbott also vowed to keep sending busloads of asylum-seekers to New York City saying Adams was merely “getting a taste” of what beleaguered border communities have been dealing with in the Lone Star State since President Biden took office.

Abbott’s comments on Fox News came amid his ongoing feud with Adams over migrant relocations and just hours after three charter buses hired by Abbott dropped off nearly 100 migrants outside the Port Authority terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

The transports added to almost 70 who arrived on Friday and Sunday.

In response to Adams’ threat Tuesday that he was “deeply contemplating taking a busload of New Yorkers to go to Texas and do some good old-fashioned door-knocking” against Abbott the Republican governor said “You know I kind of feel like Clint Eastwood.”

“Go ahead mayor. Make my day” he said.

The taunt echoed Eastwood’s iconic line from the 1983 movie “Sudden Impact” in which his San Francisco detective character “Dirty Harry” faced off against a robber who was holding a coffee shop waitress at gunpoint.

Then-President Ronald Reagan also famously invoked Eastwood’s words in 1985 when he threatened to veto “any tax increase that Congress might even think of sending up.”

“And I have only one thing to say to the tax increasers: Go ahead. Make my day” he added.

Abbott said there “could hardly be anything better” for him than for Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke to be “aided by a bunch of New Yorkers.”

“That will not be viewed very positively by the state of Texas” he said.

Abbott also accused Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul both Democrats of “rank hypocrisy” for attacking his motives in responding to what he calls President Biden’s “open border policies.”

“Listen New York is a sanctuary city” Abbott said.

“Mayor Adams said that they welcome in illegal immigrants. And now once they have to deal with the reality of it they’re suddenly flummoxed and they cannot handle it.”

Abbott added: “They are now getting a taste of what we’re having to deal with … the challenges that Texas is dealing with every day.”

“Only when they see that will the Biden ministration begin to have to realize the Biden administration is gonna have to finally start enforcing the laws passed by Congress that secure the border” he said.

Adams responded during an unrelated afternoon news conference in Queens saying of Abbott “I know he thinks he’s Clint Eastwood but he’s not.”



“He is a anti-American governor that is really going against everything we stand for” Adams blasted in response to a question from The Post.



“And I am going to do everything feasible to make sure Texans the people of Texas realize how harmful he is to us globally.”



Adams then called Abbott a “global embarrassment.”



“Because this is not what we do as Americans” the mayor said.



“All of us — and I’m sure if he goes into his lineage he came from somewhere. And if his ancestors were treated the way he’s treating these asylum seekers and migrants then he would not be where he is right now.”



The mayor said that “without the proper coordination” the city was “unable to receive people at one location and give them the support they deserve…but often they end up at our intake centers.”



Adams also called on New Yorkers to assist the migrants saying that “if anyone in the city sees someone that they believe needs the assistance we’re asking them to point them and direct them to the intake centers.

The Biden administration quietly ended the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy Monday — clearing the way for potentially tens of thousands more migrants to enter the US and stay here while their applications for asylum are processed.

The Department of Homeland Security announced it would no longer enroll asylum-seekers in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program – which forced about 70000 people back south of the border over the past three years to await their immigration hearings.

Abbott who began sending migrants to Washington in April said that “our goal is to for one help our local communities and in doing so send even more buses to New York to DC and maybe even to other communities to alleviate the challenge we dealing with.”

In addition Abbott said he wanted “to continue to expose this national catastrophe caused by President Biden.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzEwL255Yy1tYXlvci1hZGFtcy1zYXlzLXRleGFzLWdvdi1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1pcy1hLWdsb2JhbC1lbWJhcnJhc3NtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYC Mayor Adams says Texas Gov.

It’s impossible to overstate the talent of Quinta Brunson creator executive producer writer and star of ABC’s hit comedy “Abbott Elementary.” But part of Brunson’s genius has been surrounding herself with gifted artists who are keen to tap into her creative vision. Indeed part of the reason that “Abbott Elementary” is such a hot commodity is thanks to the show’s stellar comedic cast including Janelle James Sheryl Lee Ralph and Tyler James Williams all of whom earned Emmy nominations for their performances.

And while each actor’s reaction to the nomination news was different all were uniformly delighted at the accolades that the series earned and the fact that production had just begun on the 22-episode second season. Ralph who plays a veteran kindergarten teacher said she “lost it” on hearing the news and added “It felt as though every show I’ve ever done every word I’ve ever uttered from a script came flooding on me.”

Williams for his part reacted to his nomination for playing a solemn first-grade teacher by standing in the living room in silence with his brother and wondering “What does this mean?” And James who spent most of her career as a comedian before landing her breakout role as the school’s outrageous principal said her response was “Of course (“Abbott Elementary”) was nominated! We killed it! Why wouldn’t we get nominated?”

James isn’t wrong. “Abbott Elementary” certainly took the Emmys by storm with seven nominations for a network series that aired as a mid-season replacement. But Williams has his own suspicions as to why the show hit a nerve with audiences against all odds. “Coming out of the pandemic that two years it felt like people were just kind of doing shit” he said. “And the bar for people wanting to show up and do things well had fallen. I think there’s something about seeing these teachers at this school knowing how hard it is but still wanting to do the absolute best that they can. It’s not a show about somebody who’s a hot mess and comfortable being a hot mess. They want to do a good job. And I think we need that right now.”

“Abbott Elementary” (ABC)

In addition real-life teachers are seeing their hardships depicted for a wider audience and are grateful for the raised awareness the series offers. “I’ve heard from teachers how much they love having their stories told having their trials their joys uplifted so people can see and that has been great” Ralph said. “And they pay attention so much that I had someone say to me ‘I love the fact that you wear sensible shoes. You’re not dressed up like one of those TV teachers!’”

James however might have the clearest read on what makes “Abbott Elementary” in its entirety—cast crew and beyond—work as well as it does. “I think the main reason is there’s no jerks” she said. “We’re all here with a good boss and just kind of get it done. I mean I’ve been in bad situations before I got into acting bad jobs and bad co-workers. This just isn’t one of those situations. I guess we got lucky. Like we’re all just cool people and (we) come in and have fun.”

But how else can you describe what the veteran actress is doing from her Southern California backyard via Zoom? Sure Ralph is just talking peeling back the layers of her decades-long career and delighting in her first Emmy nomination at 65 for her role in “Abbott Elementary.” But she does not simply speak. She emotes. She inspires. She preaches.

The UChicago-AbbVie Research Symposium celebrates another successful year of strategic partnership showcasing select innovative research efforts in oncology.

Taking place Friday August 19 2022 the symposium aims to stimulate engagement and new collaborations between leadership and researchers through poster sessions presentations and networking opportunities.

“This research symposium will bring academia and industry together to exchange new ideas and drive innovation. The insights learned from one another could be used to accelerate the development of lifesaving cancer treatments for patients” said Kunle Odunsi AbbVie Foundation Distinguished Service Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Director of the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Odunsi who also is the Dean for Oncology within the University’s Biological Sciences Division joined UChicago Medicine in March of this year following a $10 million grant from the AbbVie Foundation to support scientific and educational activities.

“Our oncology collaboration with the University of Chicago enables us to combine our expertise in understanding the underlying biology in key areas of interest such as immuno-oncology oncogenic pathways and biomarkers of drug sensitivity or disease” said Steve Davidsen Vice President Oncology Discovery Research at AbbVie. “This effort drives towards a common goal of accelerating discovery efforts and delivering novel therapies to people living with cancer.”

The UChicago and AbbVie in 2021 announced an extended collaboration agreement through 2025 to support preclinical oncology research. To date the collaboration has led to novel insights related to biomarkers and therapeutic applications for existing AbbVie programs. This has included the development of novel drug delivery approaches to enhance anti-tumor immune response and incorporating unique 3D screening methodologies for selecting novel therapeutic molecules.

“The AbbVie-UCCCC partnership is a model of academic-commercial collaboration. The investment in peer-reviewed independent translational research has led to and promises to continue to lead to novel insights into cancer pathophysiology that is applicable to development of novel therapies and more thoughtful application of currently available treatments” said Walter Stadler Fred C. Buffet Professor of Medicine Dean for Clinical Research Senior Advisor to the Director Comprehensive Cancer Center University of Chicago.

After an FDA visit last summer yielded a Form 483 the FDA completed its re-inspection of Revance’s production facility in July the company said in a recent investor report. The good news is the FDA closed out the original five observations it made in 2021. The bad news? The FDA slapped Revance with another Form 483 this time outlining three separate issues.

Revance says it has “already provided its responses” and feels “confident” about the adjustments it’s proposed.

Still the FDA rebuke bodes ill for the near-term approval DaxibotulinumtoxinA—Revance’s would-be rival to AbbVie’s Botox—which is up for a potential U.S. green light by Sept. 8.

In the latest Form 483 the FDA’s first observation covers failures to consistently respond to deviations of standard operating procedures. The second centers on the company's operation and cleaning of filtration equipment. In the third observation the FDA said Revance failed to include a redundant site for working cell bank storage in its application.

Revance’s regulatory path for DaxibotulinumtoxinA has been riddled with potholes. Before the company earned its first Form 483 last year COVID-19 restrictions delayed a 2020 inspection of the company’s Newark California plant forcing Revance to wait on an approval decision.

Things came to a head last July however when the FDA handed down five observations regarding quality control measures and record-keeping.

In October 2021 Revance said it had responded to the issues and still expected an FDA approval by the end of 2021.

Aside from Revance's regulatory ordeals the company is battling a patent lawsuit from Botox maker AbbVie. A Revance spokesperson last year said it believes the patents at issue ""are not infringed upon by Revance or our supply source partner Ajinomoto or are invalid.""

The FDA is weighing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for approval as an injection for frown lines which is one of Botox’s approved aesthetic uses.

With those rising numbers in mind Bristol Myers Squibb is doubling down on treating the condition with a nearly $2 billion partnership with GentiBio to develop Treg therapies for patients with IBD.

Inflammatory bowel disease is an umbrella term for two difficult-to-treat diseases: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both Crohn’s and UC are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. That inflammation ultimately damages the patient’s GI tract which spans from the mouth to the anus.

The exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease is not entirely understood. However it is believed to involve an interaction between the immune system genes and environmental factors.

Pharma giant Bristol Myers Squibb which won regulatory approval for ulcerative colitis drug Zeposia is turning to cell therapy for potential long-lasting treatment of these diseases. In partnership with Boston-based GentiBio BMS aims to harness the capabilities of engineered Treg therapies to re-establish immune tolerance and repair tissue in patients living with IBD.

A Potential Functional Cure

Regulatory T cells otherwise known as Tregs are a specialized type of T cell that can modulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems and suppress immune responses that can lead to inflammation that plays a significant role in IBD. BMS and GentiBio hope the use of Tregs will provide lasting support to patients particularly those that have not achieved improvement from available small molecules and biologics.

Many of the current therapies aimed at types of IBD including AbbVie’s Humira the world’s top-selling drug can have adverse effects outside the GI tract. They can also suppress the body’s ability to effectively respond to infections and diseases such as COVID-19. GentiBio’s approach aims to mitigate those concerns about immune suppression. Tregs are designed to suppress multiple inflammation mechanisms and promote homeostasis within the tissue to stimulate the body’s self-repair capabilities.

GentiBio launched last year with a technology platform aimed at combining Tregs biology and antigen receptor engineering in order to develop engineered Tregs designed to provide a functional cure for autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Adel Nada co-founder and CEO of GentiBio told BioSpace that the Tregs developed by his company can suppress inflammation in the targeted area while also repairing tissues damaged by excessive inflammation.

For IBDs this includes repair to the mucosal lining of the intestines. By repairing that lining Nada explained that the healing property of the Tregs will prevent the incursion of the microbiome of the intestine into the gut which can be detrimental to patients.

“By repairing the gut/ microbiome interface… we believe we have the potential to reverse the pathology of IBD and reestablish tolerance within the body” Nada said. “Unlike existing therapies Tregs have the unique potential to re-establish immune tolerance in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as IBD.""

Nada said Tregs which have been in development by other companies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have been aimed at IBD before. However he noted that many of those first-generation Treg-based therapeutics did not achieve the desired levels of safety and efficacy that developers had hoped for.

“It’s a challenging disease to begin with” he said noting the lack of success with those early Treg approaches.

As IBDs become more commonplace Nada said they will have more opportunities to determine the best approach to treating the diseases with this modality. As the treatments improve Nada said the manufacturing process will improve which should help maintain cost efficiency.

A Validation of the Treg Space

Under the terms of the multi-year collaboration GentiBio will apply its modular engineered Treg platform and scalable manufacturing process to produce stable and disease-specific engineered Tregs against multiple targets. What those targets are have not been disclosed. BMS will be eligible to develop and advance up to three of the programs from the collaboration into clinical trials.

Robert Plenge senior vice president and head of translational medicine at BMS and head of the company’s immunology cardiovascular and fibrosis thematic research center touted the potential of Tregs for IBD. In other disease-based spaces Plenge said Tregs have “demonstrated the potential to suppress inflammation and autoimmune dysfunction in a tissue-restricted manner” which had led to the avoidance of harmful immune suppression. Plenge added that the companies will look to the promise of Tregs and explore their potential in IBD.

Nada said he not only views the collaboration with BMS as an important validation of GentiBIo’s Treg platform and approach but he believes it will also be a validation of the Treg space “writ large.”

The partnership's financial terms include an undisclosed cash payment made to GentiBio. As the program unfolds GentiBio stands to make up to $1.9 billion in development and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on any approved therapeutics."

This is the third contract extension given to the IT consultancy which has held the contract since 2012.

WHY IT MATTERS

While no new services will be added under the new A$100 million ($70 million) contract the agency decided to extend its contract with Accenture ""to ensure the continued secure and reliable operation of the My Health Record system"" it said in an emailed statement.

As its operator Accenture is supporting over 60 technology infrastructure components that make up the core of the My Health Record system.

THE LARGER CONTEXT

Accenture's continued support to My Health Record is ""critical"" to allow the ADHA to respond to changing user requirements and government policy priorities while it is undergoing a national infrastructure modernisation programme.

""The extended contract contains terms that allow for the progressive decommissioning of the NIO services as the national infrastructure is modernised while ensuring security and reliable continuity of service until those changes are fully effected"" the agency said.

The ADHA is modernising its national infrastructure to improve components that support its key national health services. As part of the first phase of the modernisation programme it sought to replace its Health API Gateway with a single consolidated gateway. In July last year it awarded Deloitte a contract to build its FHIR-based Health Information Gateway which will provide a secure and scalable platform for exchanging and accessing health information.

Meanwhile the ADHA also disclosed that it has migrated its data to the Microsoft Azure cloud in line with the Australian Government’s Whole-of-Government Hosting Strategy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZXJwLnRvZGF5L2FjY2VudHVyZS1mZWRlcmFsLXNlcnZpY2VzLXNlY3VyZXMtdXMtYXJteS1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accenture Federal Services secures US Army contract,"Accenture Federal Services (AFS) a subsidiary of Accenture has won a five-year contract from the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) to deploy ServiceNow and modernize its Enterprise Service Management (ESM) capabilities.

Electronics apparel and toys drove down prices online while food costs remained elevated

Consumers spent $73.7 billion online in July down from $74.1 billion in June

Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the latest online inflation data from the Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI) powered by Adobe Analytics. In July 2022 online prices decreased 1%year-over-year (YoY)—after increasing 0.3% YoY in June and 2% YoY in May—and dropped 2% on a monthly basis. July is the first month where e-commerce entered deflation after 25 consecutive months of persistent inflation online. Most of the categories tracked by the DPI (14 out of 18) saw month-over-month (MoM) price decreases in July.

Price Table Year over Year (Graphic: Business Wire)

Prices for electronics the largest category in e-commerce with 18.6% share of spend in 2021 fell sharply and decreased 9.3% YoY (down 2% MoM). This is a greater YoY decrease than June (down 7.3% YoY) and May (down 6.5% YoY). Prices for apparel fell 1% YoY (down 6.3% MoM) marking the second consecutive month where prices fell after dropping 0.1% YoY in June. Apparel prices had increased for 14 consecutive months since April 2021 with prices having spiked in recent months (up 9% YoY in May 12.3% YoY in April and 16.3% YoY in March). Toy prices fell significantly dropping 8.2% YoY (down 2.9% MoM) a record YoY low for the category in the last 31 months. Food costs remained high however with grocery prices rising 13.4% YoY (up 1.4% MoM) a record YoY high and the largest increase of any category.

In July consumers spent $73.7 billion online $400 million less than the prior month ($74.1 billion). On a YoY basis however e-commerce spend in July grew 20.9% with Prime Day driving record online sales for the retail industry overall. Online spending in July also decreased compared to May ($78.8 billion) and April ($77.8 billion). E-commerce demand remains resilient on a year-to-date basis with consumers spending $525.4 billion online in 2022 so far growing 9.2% YoY.

“Wavering consumer confidence and a pullback in spending coupled with oversupply for some retailers is driving prices down in major online categories like electronics and apparel” said Patrick Brown vice president of growth marketing and insights Adobe. “It provides a bit of relief for consumers as the cost of food continues to rise both online and in stores.”

The DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online as e-commerce expands to new categories and as brands focus on making the digital economy personal. Powered by Adobe Analytics it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics apparel appliances books toys computers groceries furniture/bedding tools/home improvement home/garden pet products jewelry medical equipment/supplies sporting goods personal care products flowers/related gifts non-prescription drug and office supplies.

In July 11 of the 18 categories tracked by the DPI saw YoY price increases with groceries rising the most. Price drops were observed in seven categories: electronics jewelry books toys computers sporting goods and apparel.

Only four of the 18 categories in the DPI saw price increases MoM. Price drops were observed across 14 categories including electronics personal care products office supplies jewelry books furniture/bedding toys home/garden appliances flowers/related gifts computers sporting goods medical equipment/supplies and apparel.

Notable categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index for July:

Electronics: Prices were down 9.3% YoY (down 2% MoM) bringing it back to pre-pandemic levels when electronic prices fell 9.1% YoY on average between 2015 and 2019. As the biggest category in e-commerce by share of spend price movements have an outsized impact on overall inflation online.

Apparel: Prices were down 1% YoY while falling significantly on a monthly basis (down 6.3% MoM). This is the first notable YoY decrease for the category as prices only fell by 0.1% YoY in June. It comes after 14 consecutive months where prices had risen consistently reversing a predictable pattern of heavy discount periods.

Toys: Prices were down 8.2% YoY (down 2.9% MoM) the largest YoY drop for the category since December 2019 when prices were down 10% YoY during the holiday shopping season. This is the 16th consecutive month of deflation for the category after prices had risen 0.2% YoY in March 2021.

Groceries: Prices continued to surge and rose 13.4% YoY (up 1.4% MoM) more than any other category. It is a new YoY record following a 12.4% YoY increase in June a 11.7% YoY increase in May and a 10.3% YoY increase in April—all previous record highs. Grocery prices have risen for 30 consecutive months and it remains the only category to move in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index on a long-term basis.

Pet Products : Prices were up 12.6% YoY (up 1.7% MoM) a record YoY high for the category. This follows a 11.3% YoY increase in June and a 9.1% YoY increase in May. Online inflation for pet products has now been observed for 27 consecutive months as pet ownership surged during the COVID-19 pandemic and demand for related goods remains high.

Methodology

The DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe’s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.

Powered by Adobe Analytics Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.

(Marble Photo)

Marble a Seattle startup building software-enabled rental management systems for smaller landlords raised $2 million.

The company was co-founded in 2020 by Daniel Li a former software engineer at Facebook and Daniel Kim a former senior engineer at Adobe. Li said that the idea to build Marble came from an experience in college when it took his landlord more than 18 months to fix a leaky roof.

“The only time they responded was when we started to threaten legal action” he said.

Marble which went through Y Combinator’s accelerator program last summer works with property owners to locate and place tenants collect rent payment and handle maintenance requests. The goal is to replace as many of the jobs typically done by landlords or property managers with software components. It makes its money through a subscription-based service; users pay $50 per month.

“We realized there’s this paradox in this industry” Li said about the startup’s business model. “The nicer houses which usually fetch higher amounts of rent are actually easier to manage than the smaller houses that are in older and more rundown areas.”

Marble has grown to more than 600 homes. (Marble Photo)

The startup currently makes about $30000 in monthly revenue and has more than 600 homes in its inventory spread out across more than 20 American cities. Li said the company is gross margin positive and makes money on a unit basis but did not reveal if it was profitable.

There are more than 48 million properties in the U.S. that are renter-occupied census data shows. That number is set to grow as investors accounted for a record 28% of U.S. single-family home sales in the first quarter of 2022 up from 19% from the same quarter last year according to a recent report by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

Marble primarily goes after smaller landlords such as investors with less than 20 properties under management. This is different than Seattle-based competitor Latchel which mainly targets large property management firms.

Marble faces a flock of other tech-enabled competitors including startups such as Innago RentRedi and Havium along with established players like Avail and Apartment.com’s rental manager tool.

“They are just trying to build a software layer for more do-it-yourself landlords” Li said of the competition. “I don’t believe that they’ve fully internalized what it would mean to actually become an alternative to a full-time property manager.”

Among the barriers the company faces as it continues to scale is its financial tech component which is handling an increasing amount of transactions on the platform. The company says it currently takes about three days for a user to receive payment from its tenants but it aims to reduce that period to less than one day.

Marble’s funders include 1984 Ventures Y Combinator Bragiel Brothers among others. It did not share its valuation."

President Biden on Tuesday heralded legislation that will pump almost $53 billion into research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips which power everything from medical devices and cars to computers and weapons systems as a “once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.”

""Today America is delivering and I honest to God believe that 50 75 100 years from now people who will look back on this week they'll know that we met this moment"" Biden said ahead of signing the CHIPS and Science Act short for Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act. The ceremony was attended by chief executives of Lockheed Martin Intel HP Micron and Advanced Micro Devices along with union leaders and lawmakers.

The legislation provides $10 billion to invest in regional technology hubs across the country and a 25% investment tax credit for expenses for manufacturing of semiconductors and related equipment. It also authorizes roughly $100 billion in spending over five years on scientific research including more than $80 billion for the National Science Foundation.

This was a week intended to be full of victory laps as Biden emerged from his COVID isolation just as Senate Democrats passed a signature climate health care and taxes package. But it was overshadowed on Monday night by the news that FBI agents had searched the home of his predecessor former President Donald Trump.

The unusual search prompted cries of political interference from conservative lawmakers. Those allegations have not been substantiated. A White House official said they did not receive notice of the search and referred questions to the Justice Department. Biden did not take questions at the event.

Biden also plans to sign off on the Senate's ratification clearing the way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO on Tuesday. And on Wednesday the White House plans an event for Biden to sign off on new funding for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and their survivors.

Semiconductor makers are planning big expansions in the United States

The CHIPS bill is aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips in a bid to stay competitive with China. According to the Congressional Research Service nearly four-fifths of global fabrication capacity was in Asia as of 2019.

Countering China's economic might has been one of Biden's top priorities since taking office. The new law will help make investments in strategic assets to do this said John Mezzalingua CEO of JMA Wireless who was at the event.

""The United States has finally woken up to what the Chinese Communist Party has known for a long time – that 5G will become the central nervous system that connects and controls all other infrastructure"" Mezzlalingua said in a statement. ""The free world will depend on it – our homes schools jobs water systems electrical grids transportation networks manufacturing and military.""

During his remarks Biden described how the lack of domestic capacity for semiconductor manufacturing contributed to inflation when factories abroad shut down during the coronavirus pandemic.

He pushed back on criticism of subsidizing the semiconductor industry saying the law is ""not handing out blank checks to companies.""

""I'm ordering my administration to be laser-focused on the guardrails that will protect taxpayers dollars"" Biden said. ""It means making sure that companies partner with community colleges and technical schools offer training and apprenticeship programs and work with small minority-owned businesses. We'll have the power to take back any federal funding if the companies don't meet these commitments required by the bill.""

The White House promoted investments in American semiconductor manufacturing that companies have announced including a $40 billion pledge from Micron in memory chip manufacturing and a $4.2 billion investment by Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries to expand production. Qualcomm announced has it will increase semiconductor production domestically by 50% over the next five years.

""We're going to construct an entire semiconductor ecosystem right here in the United States of America"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the White House event.

This bill is the latest piece of bipartisan legislation to make it to Biden's desk following gun safety and infrastructure legislation.

Seventeen Senate Republicans voted in favor of the legislation. 24 House Republicans also voted for the bill bucking party leadership who attempted to whip against the bill as part of a political fight over a Democratic deal on a climate and tax bill.

Beelink kindly sent one for review and I’ve looked at performance running both Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04.

Beelink SER5 Hardware Overview

The Beelink SER5 physically consists of a 126 x 113 x 42mm (4.96 x 4.45 x 1.65 inches) square metal case. As an actively cooled mini PC it uses AMD’s 7 nm Zen 3 Ryzen 5 5600H Cezanne processor which is a six-core 12-thread 3.3 GHz mobile processor boosting to 4.2 GHz with Radeon Graphics.

The front panel has an illuminated power button a 3.5mm headphone jack a Type-C USB 3.1 port with Alternate Mode dual USB 3.1 ports and a reset pin-hole ‘CLR CMOS’. The rear panel includes a gigabit Ethernet port a USB 3.1 port and a USB 2.0 port dual HDMI 2.0 ports and the power jack.

Internally there is an M.2 2230 WiFi 6E (or 802.11ax) Mediatek MT7921K card which supports the new 6 GHz band an M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 3.0 SSD drive (the review model included a 500 GB Kingston NV1 drive complete with Windows 11 Pro installed) and the ability to add a 2.5” SATA drive to the lid which is connected to the motherboard via a short ZIF cable:

There are also two SODIMM memory slots supporting up to 64 GB of memory and the review model included two sticks of Crucial 16 GB DDR4 3200 MHz memory for a total of 32 GB noting that this particular memory is single-rank:

The specifications state:

and the Beelink webpage lists all of the USB ports as 3.0 so I tested them together with the Type-C USB port using a Samsung 980 PRO PCle 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD housed in an ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’ (ORICO M2PAC3-G20 M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure) which showed that all the ‘blue’ USB ports and the Type-C USB port were USB 3.1 (USB 3.2 Gen 2×1 i.e. 10 Gbit/s):

however the ‘black’ rear USB port was only USB 2.0:



Additionally the Type-C port also supports video output through ‘Alternate Mode’:





so the device can support three 4K displays.

Box contents

In the box you get a power adapter and cord both a short and a longer HDMI cable a VESA mounting bracket together with a small packet of miscellaneous screws. Also included is a multilingual user manual:

Review Methodology

When reviewing mini PCs I typically look at their performance under both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) and compare them against some of the more recently released mini PCs. I now review using Windows 11 version 21H2 and Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. I test with a selection of commonly used Windows benchmarks and/or equivalents for Linux together with Thomas Kaiser’s ‘sbc-bench’ which is a small set of different CPU performance tests focusing on server performance when run on Ubuntu. On Ubuntu I also compile the v5.15 Linux kernel using the default config as a test of performance using a real-world scenario.

Prior to benchmarking I perform all necessary installations and updates to run the latest version of the OS. I also capture some basic details of the device for each OS.

Installation Issues

On Windows running the pre-installed AMD Radeon Software (version 21.6.1) errored with a software and driver version mismatch:

however this was easily resolved by downloading and installing the latest version (22.7.1):

When booting Ubuntu 22.04.1 there are various BIOS errors being reported in the ‘dmesg’ although the significance of which has not been determined:

Running the benchmarks went smoothly with the exception of the ‘OpenSSL’ test from ‘sbc-bench’. When running the test the results were inconsistent including across runs. Both the reason and implications of this are not currently known and as such will be ’taken with a huge grain of salt’:

Windows 11 performance on Beelink SER5 mini PC

The Beelink SER5 came installed with a licensed copy of Windows 11 Pro version 21H2 which after applying updates was build 22000.832. A quick look at the hardware information shows it is aligned to the specification:

A brief check showed working audio Wi-Fi Bluetooth and Ethernet.

I then set the power mode to ‘High performance’ and ran my standard set of benchmarking tools to look at performance under Windows:

I also tested Cinebench R23:

All these results can then be compared with other recent mini PCs:

The Beelink SER5 performance is quite similar to the SER4. The SER5 (Ryzen 5 5600H) reduced core count is mitigated by the higher base frequency for results when compared to the Beelink SER4 (Ryzen 7 4800U) and the faster drive performance results in an overall improvement for the SER5 over the SER4 despite the lower graphics of RX Vega 7 verses RX Vega 8.

Ubuntu 22.04 Performance

After shrinking the Windows partition in half and creating a new partition I installed Ubuntu as dual boot using an Ubuntu 22.04 ISO as the first point release has been delayed and it was necessary to perform a manual upgrade to 22.04.1. After installation and updates a brief check showed working audio Wi-Fi Bluetooth and Ethernet.

The key hardware information under Ubuntu 22.04.1 is as follows:

I then set the CPU Scaling Governor to ‘performance’ and ran my Linux benchmarks for which the majority of the results are text based but the graphical ones included:

and the latter can be directly compared to when run in Windows using the OpenGL render:

I also ran PassMark PerformanceTest Linux:

which can be directly compared to the results from when it was run on Windows:

The complete results together with a comparison against other recent mini PCs are:

Again the higher single core base frequency and faster drive speeds are evident when comparing the SER5 (Ryzen 5 5600H) to the SER4 (Ryzen 7 4800U) as is the slightly reduced graphics performance.

Video playback in browsers & Kodi

For real-world testing I played some videos in Edge Chrome and Kodi on Windows and in Firefox Chrome and Kodi on Ubuntu. No issues were encountered playing up to 4K 60 FPS videos however Chrome did occasionally drop frames on Ubuntu for the highest quality playback:

Gaming on Beelink SER5/AMD Ryzen 5 5600H

I also tested three games under Steam (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Grand Theft Auto V and Shadow Of The Tomb Raider) at both 1080p and 720p using default settings in both CS:GO and GTA V and with the graphical preset of ‘high’ and ‘low’ in the built-in benchmark of SOTTR. The very interesting average FPS results were as follows:

with Ubuntu out-performing Windows likely due to Valve’s ongoing commitment to Linux.

Thermals

The Beelink SER5 uses active cooling. Running a stress test on Ubuntu saw the CPU temperature climb to a peak of 83°C where it remained for the duration of the test:

During the stress test the maximum temperature I recorded on the top of the device was around 30.2°C in an ambient room temperature of 15.6°C and the fan was hardly audible reaching 38 dBA on my sound meter next to the device during the test. If the CPU frequency is monitored during the stress test it can be seen that it averages 3580 MHz:

Networking

Network connectivity throughput was measured on Ubuntu using ‘iperf3’:

and showed good WiFi performance.

Power Consumption

Power consumption was measured as follows:

Powered off (shutdown) – 0.3 Watts

BIOS – 20.5 Watts

GRUB boot menu – 19.1 Watts

Idle – 5.3 Watts (Windows) and 3.7 Watts (Ubuntu)

CPU stressed* – 46.5 Watts (Windows ‘cinebench’) and 42.4 Watts (Ubuntu ‘stress’)

*The power figures fluctuate due to the fan so the value is the average of the median high and median low power readings.

BIOS

Powering up the mini PC and hitting the F7 key results in a boot menu that includes access to the BIOS which is relatively unrestricted.

Final Observations

Whilst the SER5 uses a newer Zen architecture the performance is not substantially different from the SER4 so this mini PC should be seen as an alternative rather than as an upgrade. Overall the performance is very good.

Highlights Limitations Excellent WiFi performance Single-rank memory Additional SATA drive expandability No SD card slot

I’d like to thank Beelink for providing the Beelink SER5 for review. It retails at around $469 for a slightly lower spec’ed configuration of 16GB/500GB on the Beelink store and can also be found on Amazon US.

“It is unlikely that Beijing will take serious trade actions against electronic exports from Taiwan. Doing so would be China shooting itself in its own foot” Dexter Roberts a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council told VOA.

Taiwan makes 65% of the world’s semiconductors and almost 90% of the advanced chips.

By comparison China produces a little over 5% while the U.S. produces approximately 10% according to market analysts. South Korea Japan and the Netherlands are the other sources of the product which is at the heart of many electronic devices and machinery.

Though China produces some semiconductors it depends heavily on supplies from Taiwan for advanced chips. Taiwan’s TSMC makes most of the advanced chips in the world and counts Advanced Micro Devices Apple and Nvidia among its customers.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) in China which has 5% of the global fabrication market produces 14-nanometer chips. There is also evidence that SMIC has 7-nm technology according to a TechInsights blog. These are considered less advanced than the 3-nm chips produced by TSMC.

Beijing may not block the flow of semiconductors even if the military confrontation escalates analysts say.

“Taiwan-based TSMC is the biggest world producer of chips and China and the rest of the world need TSMC semiconductors. Hence I don’t expect China to target electronic exports” said Lourdes Casanova Gail and Rob Canizares director of the Emerging Markets Institute at Cornell University.

Though China’s People’s Liberation Army says it is rehearsing to impose a military blockade around Taiwan it will be careful not to hurt semiconductor companies like TSMC Casanova said.

“The stoppage of supply of TSMC semiconductors would be the worst scenario for China and for many other countries. TSMC’s semiconductors are used by Foxconn another Taiwanese firm which is the main manufacturer of the iPhone in plants based in China and elsewhere” she said.

Fear of invasion

A military invasion of Taiwan could disrupt supplies of semiconductors and seriously hamper dozens of high-tech companies that depend on them. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu voiced that fear when he said a military invasion would make TSMC factories inoperable.

“Our interruption would create great economic turmoil in China — suddenly their most advanced component supply disappears. It is an interruption I must say so people will think twice on this” Liu said.

“Nobody can control TSMC by force ... because it is a sophisticated manufacturing facility that depends on the real-time connection with the outside world” such as Europe the U.S. and Japan for materials chemicals and engineering software he said.

Even with China’s ban on certain imports from Taiwan analysts said Taiwan is unlikely to retaliate because it is heavily dependent on Beijing in terms of trade and investment.

“Companies like TSMC are deeply reliant simultaneously on both the U.S. and China markets. Unless the situation in the Taiwan Strait badly deteriorates and turns to outright open hostilities Taiwan will try to avoid taking any drastic action which would be cutting off chips to China” said Roberts author of The Myth of Chinese Capitalism.

China’s domestic manufacturing

China has been pushing to boost its domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Beijing has pledged $150 billion to expand the industry and be more self-reliant. Plans are in place for new semiconductor factories.

Just last year China’s chip manufacturing grew by 33.3% according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

“China’s rapid growth in semiconductor chip sales is likely to continue due in large part to the unwavering commitment from the central government and robust policy support in the face of deteriorating U.S-China relations” the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a blog.

Much of what will be produced in China is expected to be chips containing more mature technologies analysts say.

US action

Under President Joe Biden the U.S. has intensified efforts to strengthen its chip-making capabilities and reduce the reliance on external sources.

On Tuesday Biden signed the much-awaited CHIPS and Science Act which allocates around $52 billion to promote the production of microchips the powerful driver for high-end electronics used in a wide range of products including smartphones electric vehicles aircraft and military hardware.

Biden said the legislation would help “win the economic competition in the 21st century.”

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last month that it was necessary to reduce the dependence on supplies from Taiwan.

“Our dependence on Taiwan for chips is untenable and unsafe” she said on July 22. “This is a Sputnik moment for America” Raimondo said referring to the CHIPS Act. “I mean that very sincerely. And this is a project we’re working on.”

Taiwan’s TSMC website states it is building a fabrication plant in the U.S. state of Arizona with the aim of starting production in 2024. It will produce semiconductor wafers using 5-nm technology. During her recent controversial visit to Taiwan Pelosi met TSMC's Liu. TSMC is expected to be one of the beneficiaries of the $52 billion CHIPS and Science Act.

The U.S. is also countering China’s semiconductor industry in different ways. It recently broadened its ban on sales of chip-making equipment to China according to Tim Archer the chief executive officer of Lam Research Corp. a California supplier of silicon wafer fabrication gear.

The restriction would affect the shipment of machinery to produce 14 nm chips in China. This is an extension of the earlier ban which prevented the supply of machinery for making advanced technology nodes of 10 nanometers. The idea is to cover a wider range of semiconductor equipment going to China.

South Korea a U.S. ally has indicated it would also cut off the chip supply to China in case Washington imposed global sanctions on it. Cutting off supplies would put China and Russia at a major technological disadvantage and hamper their manufacture of advanced military hardware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZmFrdHkuY29tLnVhL2VuL3N2aXQvMjAyMjA4MDktdS1yb3NpanNraWotdmlqc2tvdmlqLXRlaG5pY3ppLXpuYWpzaGx5LXBvbmFkLTQ1MC1pbm96ZW1ueWgta29tcG9uZW50aXYtcnVzaS_SAXdodHRwczovL2Zha3R5LmNvbS51YS9lbi9zdml0LzIwMjIwODA5LXUtcm9zaWpza2lqLXZpanNrb3Zpai10ZWhuaWN6aS16bmFqc2hseS1wb25hZC00NTAtaW5vemVtbnloLWtvbXBvbmVudGl2LXJ1c2kvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than 450 foreign components were found in Russian military equipment – RUSI,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZmFrdHkuY29tLnVhL2VuL3N2aXQvMjAyMjA4MDktdS1yb3NpanNraWotdmlqc2tvdmlqLXRlaG5pY3ppLXpuYWpzaGx5LXBvbmFkLTQ1MC1pbm96ZW1ueWgta29tcG9uZW50aXYtcnVzaS_SAXdodHRwczovL2Zha3R5LmNvbS51YS9lbi9zdml0LzIwMjIwODA5LXUtcm9zaWpza2lqLXZpanNrb3Zpai10ZWhuaWN6aS16bmFqc2hseS1wb25hZC00NTAtaW5vemVtbnloLWtvbXBvbmVudGl2LXJ1c2kvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81D00CA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZmFrdHkuY29tLnVhL2VuL3N2aXQvMjAyMjA4MDktdS1yb3NpanNraWotdmlqc2tvdmlqLXRlaG5pY3ppLXpuYWpzaGx5LXBvbmFkLTQ1MC1pbm96ZW1ueWgta29tcG9uZW50aXYtcnVzaS_SAXdodHRwczovL2Zha3R5LmNvbS51YS9lbi9zdml0LzIwMjIwODA5LXUtcm9zaWpza2lqLXZpanNrb3Zpai10ZWhuaWN6aS16bmFqc2hseS1wb25hZC00NTAtaW5vemVtbnloLWtvbXBvbmVudGl2LXJ1c2kvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

BayWa r.e. Power Solutions will build the 30 MW AC/43 MW DC solar and 30 MW/120 MWh storage project on approximately 300 acres of leased land near Waikoloa Village in the South Kohala district of the island.

The power generated and stored by the Waikoloa Solar + Storage Project will be bought by local utility Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc. (HECO) under the terms of a cost-competitive 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA). On completion the project will produce enough electricity to power 13600 households contributing more than 7% of Hawaiʻi Island’s annual energy needs and resulting in a total avoided fuel consumption of more than 511000 barrels of oil over its 25-year lifetime.

Permits have been secured and site preparation and construction on the project have begun with substantial completion expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. Over the course of the project 200 jobs will be created and the project is expected to generate a total economic output of an estimated $47 million toward Hawaiʻi’s economy.

The solar portion of the project will feature single-axis trackers equipped with bifacial PV modules. The associated lithium-ion battery system will safely store energy during periods of low customer demand for use at peak demand periods such as the early morning or evening hours. The batteries will also provide grid and ancillary services and enable the grid to accommodate more renewable sources while displacing conventional generation.

His most recent position was executive VP and president of US & Global Business Lines before which he headed up geographic segments of South America Brazil and Europe (in descending chronological order).

A press release said that his latest role gave Nebreda responsibility for AES’ renewables’ growth in the US through its clean energy business including ‘development and implementation of robust supply chain strategies’.

Herman Bulls Fluence chairman said: “I want to thank Manuel for his leadership through Fluence’s expansion into Fluence Digital’s AI-enabled technologies Fluence’s addition of key strategic shareholders and Fluence’s initial public offering last year. As we look ahead Julian brings decades of experience in driving transformational change in the energy sector that will benefit Fluence and ultimately deliver value to our shareholders.”

Nebreda will have an annual base salary of US$600000 per year with a target annual cash bonus opportunity of 100% of that meaning total potential remuneration of US$1.2 million. He is also receiving a a one-time grant of $2500000 of stock which will vest over three years.

Dubuc’s base salary for 2021 was US$450000 with a bonus opportunity of 75% of that or US$375000 meaning a total potential remuneration of US$825000.

Dubuc also came from a tenure at AES Corporation of which a big chunk was heading up divisions in South America including eight months as president of its South America business unit and five years as president of the Mexico Central America and the Caribbean business unit.

The company grew revenues 250% in its second quarter (January-March) it announced in May when it revealed that it had brought raw material indices-based (RMI) pricing to hedge against price fluctuations (something which has existed in the EV sector for many years).

Fluence topped research firm IHS Markit’s ranking of the largest system integrators globally for 2021. It is also one of the most internationally diversified operators with projects delivered or announced in the last month alone in Ireland Taiwan and Lithuania. Growth and market development director for EMEA Julian Jansen recently explained the benefits of being international in an interview with Energy-Storage.news.

But as Energy-Storage.news reported yesterday it is also aiming to improve delivery times in its home market of the US with a new assembly facility in Utah."

Hastings Mutual turns to data to tame weather impacts on policies

Eshwar Pastapur vice president and CIO Hastings Mutual Insurance Co. Hastings Mutual Insurance Co.

Organization: Hastings Mutual Insurance Co.

Project: Geospatial Intelligence

IT Leader: Eshwar Pastapur vice president and CIO

The CIO and senior vice president of operations at Hastings Mutual Insurance had a very specific objective: To use the company’s data visualization tools to provide weather-related policy exposures. This would bring in-house and improve a function the company was getting as a fee-based service with information provided only monthly via spreadsheet.

Developing such capabilities would enable Hastings Mutual to more accurately predict the number of claims in each of its coverage areas. It would also help forecast the necessary claim support levels and improve fraud detection and the accuracy of loss reporting.

The project relies on open-source weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Iowa State University overlaying company policies and delivering greater claim predictability through the ability to drill down at the policy level.

To deliver high-performance rendering of data the team used single-page applications (SPAs) on the front end. This not only allows for easy delivery of information via web browsers but also helps with performance as pages are rendered directly on client devices. The team also used elastic techniques to expedite searching through large amounts of business data.

Geographic information is provided using PostGIS a relational database server optimized for geocoded data. Sisense business intelligence software provides the interface to present the resulting screens and support user interaction. The resulting tool with self-service visualization and analytics allows for quick access and easy manipulation of the data by users. Moreover it enables Hastings Mutual to add more capabilities in the future such as incorporating AI for underwriting decision-making.

Implemented in under six months and fully deployed in 2021 the in-house geospatial solution already has reduced claim-related and other costs and improved relevancy and timely decision-making.

“This started as an expense-saving project but now it has become a powerful competitive advantage for us” says Vice President and CIO Eshwar Pastapur explaining that IT has and can continue to layer more capabilities to the tool as business needs arise.

TIAA modernizes with microservices

Ajit Naidu CIO of retirement marketing & digital client technology TIAA TIAA

Organization: TIAA

Project: Remittance Modernization

IT Leader: Ajit Naidu CIO of retirement marketing and digital client technology

As TIAA’s client base and demand for services grew its remittance system wasn’t keeping up resulting in a scaling issue that impacted customers and left TIAA developers propping up the technology to ensure the company adhered to its contractual service-level agreements.

The company’s concerns over such issues gave rise to the Remittance Platform Modernization project which was launched to develop an application that performed 100 times better with increased stability and scalability as well as support for accelerated feature delivery a seamless client experience and a vastly improved user interface.

TIAA used domain-driven design to develop the solution and associated services establishing an internal community-managed framework for building microservices which are the core of TIAA’s new platform architecture. The company also deployed a container-first operating model that delivers all applications and services within a containerized environment for scalability and flexibility.

“The Remittance modernization effort was the refactoring and re-engineering of a complex monolithic and legacy platform” says Ajit Naidu CIO of retirement marketing and digital client technology. “This involved creating a component- and services-based architecture enabling the dynamic assembly of solutions and automated hierarchical unit testing. All the services created are built on a framework that optimizes distributed processing of data and files with caching capabilities. Also implemented the capability to replay/unwind transactions to easily fix data and/or processing errors.”

The results: a 220% improvement in system performance and a 72% reduction in data movement resulting in significant reduction in failure points with 98% testing now automated.

“In addition this led to more than 60% reduction in time to market with over 70% reduction in operational costs” Naidu adds.

Zenus Bank goes mobile for global business model

Pedro Martinez CIO Zenus Bank Zenus Bank

Organization: Zenus Bank

Project: Zenus Bank app

IT Leader: Pedro Martinez CIO

Zenus a newly chartered digital bank with a global business model is offering individuals and businesses around the world the ability to open a US bank account without having to be a US citizen or resident. It offers that capability through its native iOS and Android apps.

But developing the Zenus app presented multiple unique challenges for the new bank. Teams had to ensure the app meets all regulatory requirements while also performing to technological standards to ensure a user-friendly omnichannel banking experience to clients all over the world. They also had to successfully onboard vendors to take on their subset of the project and manage complex process integrations.

“The US banking industry has many regulatory and licensing obligations. To ensure that we met all of them we needed to have an IT infrastructure that was secure stable and fast. We also wanted to take a modular approach to banking which requires many integrations. We found it essential to be working alongside software and implementation partners who are customer-centric adhere to the latest standards and can picture one unified front and backend platform” says CIO Pedro Martinez. “Through our partnerships with the likes of Microsoft we’re achieving operational excellence so our end users have a positive banking experience.”

Using agile methodologies developers created a patent-pending omnichannel remote onboarding process and a patent-pending proprietary customer risk score. It also delivers real-time cloud-hosted fraud management on all channels.

The finance people recognize Broadcom for it is and while the technology people recognize it as well they just do not want to accept it. And we cannot blame them for that sentiment.

Broadcom began its existence as a spin-off of a spin-off. Twenty years or so ago Hewlett Packard began its process of miniaturization. First spinning off Agilent which contained a hodgepodge of businesses that were not related to PCs or printers. Agilent in turn split itself into several more pieces one of which was HP's one-time internal chip business rechristened as Avago. We followed Avago closely for many years as sell-side analysts. Buried deep inside HP we knew it sold filters that went into mobile phones and would occasionally provide some really interesting but obscure piece of information. Then the spin-off happened.

Editor's Note:

Guest author Jonathan Goldberg is the founder of D2D Advisory a multi-functional consulting firm. Jonathan has developed growth strategies and alliances for companies in the mobile networking gaming and software industries.

Avago came to life through private equity ownership and as far as origin stories go this was the key clue to what would happen next. Avago CEO Hock Tan realized something early on that most other semiconductor CEOs did not - semis had stopped being a growth industry.

The go-go days of the 80's and 90's were over and now semis were intensely competitive heavily cyclical and poorly margined. So Avago went on a buying spree buying more companies than we can count and driving the stock up 3000% (three thousand percent) in a decade and half.

The secret to this success was a fairly straightforward playbook. Buy companies which had leading positions in markets with few competitors. Then shed segments that sold into competitive sectors slash management and corporate overhead and drive cash flow - which allowed for more leverage and thus firepower for the next acquisition. And repeat.

The company was wildly successful at this and effectively catalyzed a thorough consolidation of the US semiconductor industry which went from something like 2000 companies twenty years ago to around 200 today.

For companies that got acquired the integration process was bracing. The new management team would eliminate every expense they could find - no more company swag no more free coffee famously no corporate IT department. For junior managers that survived the cuts this was fantastic. They were given autonomy the elimination of bureaucracy fat option packages and a crushing workload.

Over time another trend became apparent as well - the company would dramatically lower R&D a topic we will return to below. Another important skill Avago had was that its CEO and deal team became experts and finding the non-financial tools that would convince the board of targets to sell. Sometimes that meant retirement deals for outgoing executives an office and title for a founder or the preservation of a company's name. So when they acquired Broadcom in 2015 Avago changed their name because that is what it took to get the deal done.

The story goes that when Alexander the Great reached the Indus River he sobbed lamenting the fact that there were no more lands left to conquer. Broadcom reached their Indus in 2019 when they failed to acquire Qualcomm due to a hazy last-minute CFIUS order from the US government. Like all other successful roll-up stories Broadcom needed to keep acquiring bigger businesses to keep the machine moving. By 2019 there were really only two companies large enough to move the needle for Broadcom - Qualcomm and Intel. Qualcomm was out of bounds and Intel was too big (then) to contemplate.

And so Broadcom turned to software companies. There are plenty of large targets in this space. These companies do not necessarily have dominant positions in markets the way Broadcom's semis targets did but they do have very sticky relationships with customers who are locked into long-term contracts and multiple IT dependencies. This means steady cash flows.

The truth is Broadcom is not a semiconductor company. Nor is it a software company. It is a private equity fund maximizing cash flow from an endless series of acquisitions. This is disheartening to many in the semis industry and probably confusing to those in software. It is certainly proving to be a challenge for sell-side semis analysts who now have to master SaaS metrics. But for shareholders it remains a compelling model.

One thing we have learned about Broadcom over the years is that they are constantly looking for new deals. So we can say from experience that the day the VMWare acquisition closes the bankers will get calls asking ""What is next?""

How long can this go on? Roll-ups have a few big problems. One is the constant quest for new deals we mentioned above. The second is integration. At some point these organizations get so large they start to trip over themselves. Broadcom has largely avoided this problem by pushing so much autonomy down to individual units but at some point this has to just bog down. especially when everything is under the umbrella of a single public company.

The other problem is that the whole model is dependent on steady cash flows from the underlying businesses. This is the reason that private equity firms avoided technology for so long there is technology risk embedded in these companies that does not necessarily exist in the more traditional companies the private equity funds typically favor. And this is why we keep an eye on Broadcom's semis businesses R&D. There are no gaping flaws today - they remain incredibly strong in the networking space and are the dominant party in the duopoly around BAW RF filters for mobile phones.

That being said we hear more and more from people in the networking business that they are disappointed in the pace of development at Broadcom. New chips and features take longer and longer to arrive opening the door to start-ups and internal solutions within the hyperscalers. And in RF there is a real possibility of technological disruption to at least some portion of the BAW filter market Qualcomm and Murata seem to feel pretty strongly about that.

Admittedly the team at Broadcom are very savvy. If any of their businesses start to show signs of peaking they will sell or spin them off without a backwards glance. Of course most buyers are probably aware of this and so far Broadcom has not generated a single exit from its portfolio other than the occasional post-merger sale of an unwanted business line.

As it stands now Broadcom can probably keep this model going for a long time still. There is an ocean of software targets out there and they all got much cheaper this month. Our best guess is that the only thing could slow Broadcom down is the executive team's energy level. Hock Tan is now about 70 years old and our guess is that he has no interest in retiring to grow wine in Napa Valley any time soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmFuZ3Byb3BlcnR5dGFsay5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9wZW5hbmdzLWZpdmUtZGVjYWRlcy1vZi1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXN1Y2Nlc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Penang's five decades of industrial success,"The Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association (MSIA) celebrated Penang’s 50th anniversary of industrial excellence via a gala dinner at the Eastern & Oriental Hotel Monday evening.

The event was attended by some 300 members of the industry.

Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said technology is expected to bring transformation to the industry in the next decades.

“As we all have witnessed digitalisation was accelerated globally during the Covid-19 pandemic. In Malaysia the digital economy is expected to contribute 23% of the country’s GDP and create over 500000 jobs by 2025.

“With that in mind Penang pledges to make great strides in developing the digital economy ecosystem.

“This includes the readiness of physical and digital infrastructure availability of workforce and enhancing the livability stature.

“These are critical to sustaining our status as the Silicon Valley of the East” Chow said during his speech at the dinner.

Chow shared that the state has undertaken various efforts related to STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) to build a healthy talent pipeline to meet the industrial demands.

“I would like to ask for more industry support and partnership for our STEM initiatives to help cultivate an industry-ready talent pool in this fast-paced environment.

“The tripartite partnership (Public Private and People) is critical in charting Penang’s path to become a high-income state as well as creating quality jobs.

“Together we can make a huge leap forward making the state shine on the world map of technology” he added.

Chow said that Penang’s 50 years of industrialisation journey has impacted the local economy in terms of raising the state’s gross domestic product (GDP) uplifting the skill set of the local workforce as well as having huge economic spill-over effects on the country.

He also added that the state government will be holding a grand dinner on Dec 2 to honour the industry pioneers who have laid the groundwork for Penang with regard to the E&E industry.

At the event the launching of the MSIA ‘Silicone North’ map also took place.

Apart from that several companies namely TF-AMD Motorola Keysight Technologies Intel Malaysia Broadcom Sanmina and Agilent Technologies were recognised during the dinner.

Meanwhile MSIA president Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai lauded Penang for its successful 50 years of industrialisation journey.

“With the E&E powering the state for the past 50 years the gross domestic product (GDP) has grown from RM964 million in 1972 to RM99 billion in 2021.

“This is equivalent to adding about RM2 billion every year to Penang’s economy for the past 50 years.

“The E&E ecosystem in Penang has been further strengthened by companies filling the gap in the E&E supply chain and existing E&E companies moving up the value chain” Wong added.

The MSIA later contributed RM80000 to Tech Dome Penang in supporting its STEM initiatives.

The mock cheque for the contribution was presented by Wong to Deputy Chief Minister II Prof Dr P. Ramasamy who is also the Penang Human Resources Education Science and Technology Committee chairman.

The EPA will hold a public webinar Wednesday night for residents to hear about the issue broadly. Virtual hearings will be held in September in affected communities for residents to learn more about local risks.

Ethylene oxide is a colorless odorless flammable gas that factories use to make other chemicals and products like antifreeze and plastic bottles and to sterilize things like medical equipment. About 100 commercial sterilizers operate in the United States according to the EPA.

EPA investigators discovered the elevated cancer risks in the 23 communities in their research to develop a new emissions rule for hazardous air pollutants. The agency plans to propose stronger regulations later this year for hazardous emissions including ethylene oxide.

Ethylene oxide — which also can be present in household cleaners personal care items and fabrics — can increase the risk of blood cancers and breast cancer for people who breathe it in over the course of years according to the EPA.

In Franklin a commercial sterilization plant run by Cosmed Group Inc. uses ethylene oxide to sterilize medical devices. Cosmed acquired the facility in an industrial rural area north of Route 94 in 1997 and that year it installed a catalytic oxidizer to control emissions according to the EPA.

In Linden a factory uses ethylene oxide to sterilize agricultural products like spices and nuts. The facility opened in 1986 on Brunswick Avenue in an industrial zone north of Interstate 278. It operates four sterilizers that were installed between 1986 and 2000 and uses a two-stage scrubbing control system to control emissions according to the EPA.

Both facilities report a 99% emission reduction but “fugitive emissions” cause an elevated cancer risk according to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

The EPA and state Department of Environmental Protection are now reviewing controls on regulated equipment and processes at both locations to determine if more air pollution controls are needed according to both agencies.

Ethylene oxide is used to sterilize about half the nation’s medical devices or 20 billion devices annually according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is working to identify alternatives to ethylene oxide according to the EPA.

The state Department of Environmental Protection monitors air pollution at 30 stations around the state.

Four sites — in Camden Elizabeth New Brunswick and Chester — measure the outdoor concentration of air pollutants including ethylene oxide. All of those sites detected ethylene oxide even in rural areas away from industry suggesting a “background level” of the gas pervades the state’s air according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9maWxlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW1yYW4tbXVuc2hpLXNvbGUtMTQxNTA3MDYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Profile in Innovation: Imran Munshi The Sole Seeker,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9maWxlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW1yYW4tbXVuc2hpLXNvbGUtMTQxNTA3MDYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81DFCA60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9maWxlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW1yYW4tbXVuc2hpLXNvbGUtMTQxNTA3MDYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwci5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC8wOS9ldGh5bGVuZS1veGlkZS1lbWlzc2lvbnMtcG90ZW50aWFsLWNhbmNlci1yaXNrLWxha2V3b29kLXBsYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethylene oxide emissions from Lakewood plant could pose long-term risks to residents says EPA. What does that mean?,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is warning residents in Lakewood that long-term exposure to a toxic chemical used by a local commercial sterilizing company could significantly increase their lifetime risk of cancer.

The alert to residents comes as the federal agency re-evaluates the potential danger of ethylene oxide a toxic gas released into the air by Terumo BCT Sterilization Service Inc. which manufactures products that collect separate and process blood and other cells.

Ethylene oxide emissions from the Terumo BCT plant in Lakewood are below state and federal pollution limits but new computer modeling suggests “elevated risks” for residents who live near it and 22 similar sites across the country EPA officials said.

Those models suggest constant exposure to ethylene oxide emissions from Terumo BCT even if they’re under current state and federal limits could lead to an additional 1 to 6 cancer cases among 10000 people. EPA officials said the agency will propose additional regulations this year to reduce ethylene oxide risks posed by commercial sterilizers.

In a statement a representative for Terumo BCT said the company is “extremely diligent” in its use of the toxic compound and stressed that the EPA modeling showed potential cancer risks not confirmed increases of cancer in the community.

“Terumo BCT supports EPA’s nationwide review of [ethylene oxide] use and emission levels and its efforts to engage the community on new risk information. We will continue to provide data and the expertise of our team to assist EPA in its review.”

What is ethylene oxide?

Ethylene oxide is a sweet-smelling colorless gas that was first manufactured on an industrial scale in 1914. It serves as a raw material for many industrial processes and is used directly as a fungicide insecticide and a sterilizing compound for medical equipment according to a history compiled by the American Chemical Society which notes many of the same characteristics that make it useful also make it dangerous.

The EPA in 2016 classified ethylene oxide as a human carcinogen a move that triggered it and state environmental regulators to re-examine facilities that used the compound. When the EPA released an updated version of its nationwide assessment on health risks from air pollutants in 2018 the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment launched a more thorough investigation of operations at Terumo BCT Sterilization Services.

Computer modeling at the time predicted cancer risks near the plant were above “acceptable” federal levels said Leah Schleifer a spokesperson for the state agency. The follow-up investigation “found no evidence that there currently is more cancer in the communities around Terumo BCT than in surrounding areas” Schleifer said.

The company installed additional controls at the Lakewood plant in 2018 which significantly reduced ethylene oxide emissions state environmental regulators found. Jessi Done the senior plant manager for sterilization at the Lakewood site said the company has also installed another piece of emissions control technology called a catalytic oxidizer that will come online in 2023 and is expected to further reduce emissions.

Research has linked ethylene oxide exposure to lymphoma leukemia and breast cancer. A 2021 analysis by ProPublica showed roughly a quarter of the nearly 100 commercial sterilizers the EPA regulates have exposed nearby residents to unacceptable cancer risks and found ethylene oxide contributes more to cancer risk than any other toxic air pollutant released by American industry.

CPR News spoke to several long-time residents who live in neighborhoods near Terumo BCT all of whom declined to give their names who said they weren’t aware of the plant’s emissions or any of the state or federal government’s efforts to inform the nearby community of potential health risks.

The EPA will hold a community meeting and webinar about ethylene oxide emissions from Terumo BCT on Oct. 25.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2tuaWdodC1hZXJvc3BhY2UtdW52ZWlscy1uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tYWlycGxhbmUtZ2FsbGV5LWxhdmF0b3J5LXBhbGxldC0zMDE2MDIyODUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Knight Aerospace Unveils Next-Generation Airplane Galley-Lavatory Pallet,"Specialty air products OEM upends incumbent galley and lavatory systems with new ATGL delivered this month to the Royal Australian Air Force.

Since then air quality has improved significantly with nationwide levels of PM2.5 – harmful fine particles less than 2.5 micrometres wide – dropping by 58%. With the first campaign in that war won China is now setting its sights on less visible pollutants.

The term “new pollutants” (新污染物) has come up frequently. It appeared in the 14th Five Year Plan during the crucial Two Sessions political and legislative meetings and in the outline of the Vision 2035 plan for “socialist modernisation”. It refers to hidden pollutants that lurk in the environment cause damage in the long term – and are much harder to tackle.

The main source of these pollutants is the production and use of harmful and toxic chemicals. In May the State Council published an action plan on new pollutants kicking off a process of identifying such substances and assessing the harm they cause. Restrictions and bans were also put in place for a first batch of chemicals. There are hopes this will plug existing gaps in China’s chemicals regime.

Exposing the new pollutants

In actual fact many “new” pollutants are nothing new. At a press conference in March a Ministry of Ecology and Environment spokesperson said such pollutants are being described this way because they are less familiar to the public than conventional pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides; and because as understanding grows of the damage chemicals cause and methods for detecting them improve new harms and pollutants are being identified.

New pollutants are chemical in nature. In the US the Environmental Protection Agency refers to them as “chemicals of emerging concern”. These substances may be more common than you think occurring in everyday medicines cosmetics insecticides and detergents as well as commonly used industrial products. Think of the formaldehyde in shampoo plastic microbeads in toothpaste plasticisers in food packaging fire retardants in televisions and even antibacterials in soap. Their use and release into the environment can cause long-term negative effects and health issues even in small quantities. These include endocrine disorders in both aquatic life and humans and antibiotic resistance.

Both government and the public have overlooked these new pollutants He Linghui senior project chief with Shenzhen Zero Waste

China’s standards for environmental quality and pollutant emissions mainly focus on more conventional pollutants as do its lists of managed chemicals. Most feature on one of two lists: for air pollutants and for water pollutants. Once listed chemicals can be controlled under laws on air and water pollution.

“Most new pollutants – such as antibiotics microplastics and perfluorinated compounds – aren’t covered by environmental standards for air water and soil and mostly go unmonitored” said He Linghui senior project chief with Shenzhen Zero Waste adding that “both government and the public have overlooked these new pollutants”.

Fixing holes

The State Council’s new action plan includes identifying and assessing the environmental risks associated with these chemicals and deciding which ones most need to be controlled. Whole-lifecycle restrictions will be placed on new pollutants including bans on their production and use reduction of emissions during use and end-of-pipe solutions.

What are end-of-pipe solutions? Techniques to remove already formed contaminants from a stream of air water waste product or similar. They are called “end-of-pipe” as they are normally implemented as a last stage of a process before the stream is disposed of or delivered. Examples include a scrubber on a smokestack and a catalytic convertor on a car tailpipe. (Source: greenfacts.org)

According to the action plan the identification process for high-concern and high-production volume chemicals will be complete by 2025 as will a first batch of environmental risk assessments.

“The action plan reflects a prevention-first approach to environmental risks” said Liu Jianguo an associate professor at Peking University’s College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering. “It is an important step in plugging gaps in China’s management of hazardous chemicals.”

That management has long been focused on industrial safety and prevention of accidents leading to significant blind spots. The “imminent” risks of inflammable explosive and highly toxic chemicals get plenty of attention but hidden and long-term environmental harms are overlooked.

“China has a grasp on the risks associated with the 2800 substances on the lists of hazardous chemicals. But there’s a lack of information and understanding of the potential environmental and health harms associated with tens of thousands of other chemicals on the market” Liu said.

A first list of “new pollutants for priority control” will be published this year the plan says. Substances on those lists will either be banned or subjected to usage and emissions restrictions. Meanwhile regulators are revising guidelines on industrial restructuring in order to gradually phase out some pesticides veterinary drugs cosmetics and industrial chemicals.

The action plan also calls for stronger environmental impact assessments with tough requirements for projects involving new pollutants. The list of new pollutants for priority control will be updated as more chemicals are assessed.

An earlier consultation draft of the plan included a list of 28 new pollutants for priority control. These were mainly persistent organic pollutants endocrine-disrupting chemicals and antibiotics already restricted by international treaties.

Tougher management of consumer products

China is the world’s biggest producer and consumer of chemicals. Globally the chemicals industry is worth around US$4 trillion a year with China’s industry accounting for 45% of that figure. In 2020 chemicals worth $1.77 trillion were consumed in China. These essential raw materials are widely used in making medicines pesticides fertilisers plastics textiles building supplies laundry detergents and cosmetics.

Information on excessive levels of chemicals in consumer products has long been buried in reports on “below-standard products” issued by regulators. Shenzhen Zero Waste collected info on 1300 China-sourced products listed on the EU’s Rapid Alert System for Non-food Consumer Products warning system between 2019 and 2021 along with 1700 reports of products failing sample testing published by China’s own regulators. Problem products included clothes appliances stationery toys home textiles handbags and shoes. The organisation then looked at cases where levels of chemicals were found to be in breach of standards finding over 100 different chemicals at fault with phthalates the most common offender.

Phthalates – a group of chemicals often used to make plastic more flexible and therefore durable – disrupt the endocrine system harm fertility and can be absorbed through skin contact or respiration. They are particularly harmful for pregnant women and young children.

This is a significant step forward for China’s chemical regime Liu Jianguo associate professor at Peking University

“The main problem is a lack of controls during manufacturing” said He Linghui. “But we also note that the number of consumer product chemicals subject to controls in China is limited with most persistent organic pollutants and endocrine-disrupting chemicals not listed or only listed in certain products.”

She explained that persistent organic pollutants are not covered by any consumer product standard. These include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – which is used to coat non-stick cookware and fast food packaging – and short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) – the uses of which include fire retardants for textiles. Bisphenol A an endocrine-disrupting chemical is banned in baby bottles but permitted in certain quantities in food packaging.

The action plan aims to bolster management of chemicals in consumer products calling for limits and bans on new pollutants for priority control to be included in environmental labelling systems standards and certifications and requiring those substances be listed in labelling for key consumer goods. It also calls for restrictions on new pollutants to be added to the compulsory national standards for products such as toys and school supplies – and strictly enforced.

“The health or environmental damage caused by a chemical isn’t decided by its properties alone – the dose to which people or organisms are exposed is the deciding factor” Liu Jianguo noted. “In the past national standards for chemicals in consumer products were limited. Those chemicals under the heading of ‘new pollutants’ will now be covered by product standards to some degree bringing China in line with international practice. This is a significant step forward for China’s chemical regime.”

Controlling drinking water risks

The Yangtze and Yellow River basins are major sources of drinking water for China but their banks are home to many chemical plants. The action plan will see pilot projects launched to clean up new pollutants on the rivers and other important sources of drinking water and in certain industries. The list of new pollutants for priority control issued with the earlier consultation draft included antibiotics perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) – all of which have been causes of recent concern over pollution of drinking water.

In 2020 the news magazine Outlook Weekly published a report on antibiotic pollution of the Yangtze basin putting average levels at 156 nanograms per litre of water – higher than levels found in the US and EU.

Antibiotics in the environment lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes which are a threat to human health and the environment. Outlook’s report was included in a submission to the Two Sessions by the China Association for Promoting Democracy which in turn was noted by the government.

In 2021 a team from Tsinghua University published a study in Environmental Sciences Europe showing that drinking water in 66 Chinese cities and regions had high levels of perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances peaking at 502.9 nanograms per litre in one city. Over 40% of the cities studied had levels over a recommended limit published by the US state of California in 2019 of 5.1 nanograms per litre for PFOA and 6.5 nanograms for PFOS.

Animal studies have found exposure to perfluorinated compounds to be linked to a range of negative outcomes including higher rates of testicular and kidney cancer falls in fertility and immune system and thyroid issues.

In March this year China revised its safety standards for drinking water with a wider range of pollutants included in compulsory restrictions and water quality values. New pollutants such as perfluorinated compounds are now included as a measure of water quality but not antibiotics.

According to the action plan the first steps towards a system for monitoring new pollutants in the environment will be in place by the end of 2025. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment’s National Environmental Analysis and Monitoring Centre says methodologies for monitoring antibiotics perfluorinated compounds volatile organic compounds and persistent organic pollutants have already been developed. The ministry is also to promote sharing of new-pollutant monitoring data gathered by research bodies.

We need to avoid a vicious circle where today’s replacements become tomorrow’s pollutants Zheng Minghui State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicity

While commenting on clean-up and substitution of perfluorinated compounds in an interview with China Environmental News Zheng Minghui vice-chair of the standing committee of the State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicity said that China is only just starting research into replacements for high-risk chemicals. This process he said will focus on identifying new pollutants and their toxic effects possible replacements and providing support for clean-up operations. “We need to avoid a vicious circle where today’s replacements become tomorrow’s pollutants” added Zheng who is also a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences.

Also key manufacturers and industrial zones in the petrochemical paints textiles rubber pesticide and pharmaceutical sectors will be chosen for pilot clean-up projects with replacement and emissions reduction measures to be taken. This will reduce these forms of pollution at source while polluted water soil and sludge linked to these operations will be treated.

The next step: legislation

As tackling new pollutants will cover a range of sectors cross-departmental cooperation and a comprehensive approach will be needed. The action plan was published by the State Council with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) the lead department in charge of coordinating across other bodies: the National Development and Reform Commission the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and market and pharmaceutical regulators among others.

“This means State Council-level coordination on implementing the action plan which will help establish a cross-departmental mechanism for managing chemicals. That’s a key condition for ongoing reform and improvements” said Liu Jianguo.

While the action plan includes targets and timetables experts say there’s a lack of legislation to support its implementation.

Currently China has no law specifically on management of chemicals in the environment. Wang Jinnan an academic in the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the MEE’s Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning has written that there is no legislative backing for the reporting and risk-reduction responsibilities the action plan delegates to businesses. The same is true for bans and restrictions on the use of toxic and harmful chemicals.

A Hazardous Chemicals Safety Law China’s first such legislation is currently in a consultation phase. Industry insiders say it may simply be an upgrading of an existing set of regulations which may be insufficient in addressing the problem of chemicals with long-term harmful effects.

China’s management of chemicals has always been focused on preventing industrial accidents with the Ministry of Emergency Management (MEM) formerly the State Administration of Work Safety in charge. It was the MEM which drafted the proposed Hazardous Chemicals Safety Law.

In China the term “hazardous chemicals” is generally taken to refer to those which are inflammable or explosive or do immediate harm to health and the environment. The Hazardous Chemicals Safety Law may therefore focus on the prevention of industrial accidents but overlook the long-term harm chemicals can cause in ordinary production and use.

However the action plan does call for regulations to manage “toxic and harmful” chemicals. Insiders say that would fill out the chemicals regime and allow for better management of environmental risks while granting more powers to the MEE.

“As a developing nation and a major producer and consumer of chemicals China is facing far more complex economic technical and management challenges than other countries” said Liu Jianguo. “Tackling new pollutants will be a case of slow and steady progress. The action plan is appropriate for China and reflects how our management of chemicals is shifting from a focus on industrial safety to managing environmental and health risks.”

Now in the midst of a potential economic downturn hosting is once again proving to be a vital tool to earn. According to a recent survey conducted by Airbnb 41 percent of Hosts in the US reported that one of the reasons they host is to earn money to help navigate rising prices1.

Along with existing Hosts using hosting to keep up we are also seeing more people turning to hosting for the first time.

Today Airbnb is sharing new findings showing that new Hosts began opening their doors amidst growing inflation in Q2 2022 among other factors – as well as new insights into how these new Hosts are sharing their space as well as their ability to earn.

More people start hosting as inflation increases

Inflation has been climbing higher around the world. At the same time more people have begun hosting specifically in top tourism destination countries with high growth in inflation. While there are other factors that contribute to Host growth – including seasonality demand and product initiatives – according to Airbnb’s analysis on average a one percentage point increase in the inflation rate in a top Airbnb market was correlated with a nearly four percentage point increase in the number of new Hosts in that country for Q2 20222.

In the United States where inflation increased by 9.1 percent in June 2022 the number of new Hosts grew by more than 50 percent in Q2 20223 compared to Q2 2021 – and this same trend was observed around the world including:

Brazil with 11.89 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 50 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

with 11.89 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 50 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Spain  with 10.2 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and nearly 70 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

 with 10.2 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and nearly 70 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Ireland  with 9.1 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 50 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

 with 9.1 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 50 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; United Kingdom  with 9.4 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 40 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

 with 9.4 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 40 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Canada  with 8.1 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and nearly 100 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

 with 8.1 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and nearly 100 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Italy  with 8 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 60 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

 with 8 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 60 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Mexico  with 7.99 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 40 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

 with 7.99 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 40 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Germany with 7.6 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 70 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

with 7.6 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 70 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; New Zealand with 7.3 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 30 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

with 7.3 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 30 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; Australia  with 6.1 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 30 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022;

with 6 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 40 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022; and France with 5.8 percent increase in inflation in June 2022 and more than 30 percent increase in new Hosts in Q2 2022.

For new Hosts it’s mortgages on their mind

Hosts around the world have long shared that hosting helps them to afford their home – with the need to pay for their mortgage or rent even serving as a reason why many began hosting in the first place. According to an Airbnb survey nearly 40 percent of Hosts in the US said that the income earned through hosting has helped them stay in their home in 20214.

Now with the cost of homeownership rising new Hosts in the US are not only turning to hosting but also may be hosting more frequently once they get started to increase their earning potential and cover a larger mortgage. Regions with the greatest hikes in local residents’ mortgage payments also saw an increase in earnings for typical new Hosts in Q2 2022 – suggesting more hosting activity5.

In fact according to Airbnb’s analysis in Q2 2022 a $1 rise in the average American’s monthly mortgage payment – due to the hike in mortgage interest rates from three percent to six percent – was correlated with a 26-cents increase in a new typical Host’s earnings for the quarter6.

New Hosts see the opportunity to earn

Inflation may be rising but so too is the income Hosts are earning. As Airbnb has reported in 2021 the typical Host in the US earned over $13800 – an increase of 85 percent over 2019. The typical income of $13800 represents over two months of pay for the median US household.

For those who have begun hosting recently due to the changes in cost of living the ability to earn is still strong: New Hosts earned a combined total of over $1.8 billion globally in 2021 up more than 30 percent from 2019.

And this opportunity has continued into 2022 – including for younger Hosts many of whom have discovered hosting as a way to fulfill their dreams even as new financial responsibilities and burdens stack up. In the first three months of 2022 alone Hosts under 30 in the US combined earned approximately $200 million – after earning approximately $775 million total in all of 2021.

Hosts are sharing the space they have to get started now

With these new economic pressures more people are not only looking to start hosting but also to do so flexibly – leveraging the space they have to earn and quickly. New listings that were activated and booked in Q1 2022 are getting booked faster compared to a year ago with the average time to get a first booking for the majority of new listings being about a week.

Lucy Paterson Host of The Cowshed – Luxury Barn with Hot Tub (Woodcote Green England) While these changes in cost of living may be recent hosting has long served as a resource for people around the world amidst personal shifts in financial situations. Take Host Lucy in Birmingham England who decided to convert her barn’s outhouse into a tiny home when she was furloughed from her job in the hospitality industry at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a leap amidst the uncertainty of losing her paycheck but as she saw the demand for staycations across the United Kingdom as lockdown continued she knew that her backyard could fill a need while paying off the investment needed for renovations in time. And one year into her hosting journey Lucy has seen that return – earning £432057 to date – especially as events have returned: She most recently welcomed the family of a New Zealand athlete during the Commonwealth Games.

And for those with more limited space to share private room listings – which offer singular rooms to travelers in a Host’s home – are also a simple (and increasingly popular) way to earn. In the US alone the following states have welcomed the greatest increase in new private room listings in Q2 2022 compared to Q2 20218:

South Dakota

Indiana

Connecticut

Arizona

Alaska

Nebraska

Oregon

Montana

The properties she manages are all short-term rental units.

Before she was hopping from German row-homes to luxury apartments in the Queen City Henry spent years in the traditional hospitality business working in hotels for the likes of Marriot and Hilton. With the emergence of websites like Airbnb and Vrbo she saw a better way.

Now Henry works as the City Manager of Operations on a small team at Liberty Hill Rentals which operates short-term rental properties under the host name ""Chris & Chris"" on Airbnb. According to its website the company offers ""centrally located homes away from home for corporate and vacation travelers.""

Chris & Chris have 71 listings to their name in Cincinnati. Prices range from $50 to $3000 per night some of which include multi-family stays where the costs can be split up.

Chris & Chris started in 2015 in founder Chris Hikel's spare bedroom. He listed it on Airbnb to try and make some extra cash. By the time Liberty Hills Rentals was officially formed in 2019 Chris had 21 short-term rental properties across the Queen City. After bouncing back from a major dip in business due to COVID-19 the company now has more than 70 rental listings in at least 15 buildings in Over-The-Rhine Mount Adams Pendleton and Covington.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals This property in Over-The-Rhine is listed at $3000 per night on Chris and Chris's Airbnb account. The three bedroom unit sleeps up to 10 guests.

Henry said the majority of Chris & Chris's listings are not owned by Liberty Hill Rentals.

""We actually manage for private owners"" Henry said ""We do the day-to-day communications the property upkeep we handle the housekeeping and everything from that end.""

Henry said Hikel owns around 25% of the listings. The other 75% they manage are owned by locals and people who live out of town. According to Henry some listings are single units within condo complexes while other listings are entire buildings with multiple rentals available for booking.

One of their buildings is right next to Rhinegeist Brewery with different themed suites named after Rhinegeist beer like the Bubbles Suite Swizzle Suite or the Cheetah Suite. Henry said the brewery will often refer guests of big events like weddings to stay in Airbnbs owned by Liberty Hill Rentals.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals According to Liberty Hill Rentals this entire building is renovated and sleeps up to 16 guests in multiple units. It is located close to Rhinegeist Brewery in OTR. It is listed on Airbnb for $2271 per night.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals Here's a look inside on of the units in a renovated OTR building that can cost up to $2271 per night.

""Rhinegeist obviously has that event space so we've had a lot of weddings come in a lot of wedding parties; they need a good amount of space. We've had family reunions in that building just different gatherings"" Henry said. ""Thanksgiving it... usually rents out for the entire building because people are looking for a place for their entire families to stay.""

Henry said the rentals are not limited to a week-by-week basis. She said that while they don't offer typical 12-month leases clients have rented for 3-to-6 months at a time. She said she's seen everyone from traveling nurses to filmmakers reaching out to the company because they need more than just a hotel room but won't be in town long enough to rent for a year.

""I think we are meeting a need"" Henry said. ""Our portfolio is so diverse that we can almost have something to accommodate everybody.""

Henry believes there will always be a need for the standard hotel but with the emergence of companies like Airbnb travelers have thousands more options of where they can stay and when.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals Some properties include outdoor spaces for guests to utilize. This OTR listing costs up to $116 per night.

Right now their business is growing through word of mouth but Henry said after they reach their goal of 80 listings by 2023 they will start focusing more on reaching out to other Airbnb owners and asking if they could use their management services. Eventually the long-term goal is for the business to expand outside of Cincinnati.

Henry said all their listings can be found on Airbnb and the company's website. She said some listings are also now on Vrbo.

Short-term vs. long-term

Henry said property developers and property owners are shifting to a short-term rental plan instead of a traditional 12-month lease because it gives them a bigger return on their investment.

The short-term rental industry has been repeatedly accused of driving housing prices up by contributing to the housing shortage both in the U.S. and abroad. The accusations have been coming from city councils in popular travel destinations like Amsterdam London and New York City.

Charles Tassell the Chief Operating Officer for the National Real-Estate Investors Association said the real estate and the rental markets are ""hot"" but he doesn't typically see short-term rentals impacting the overall housing and renting market in Cincinnati.

""It especially doesn't affect lower income renters or even medium income renters"" Tassell said. ""These are high-end properties that are being turned into short-term rentals.""

Tassell said these properties that are being rented were never in the market price range for low-income or medium-income renters in the first place.

According to Apartments.com most rentals in and around the same geographical area where Liberty Hill Rentals have the most listings start at more than $1000 a month for a studio apartment. The cheapest listing we found was a one-bedroom for $800 a month. Less than a mile away the most expensive listing we found was $4302 for a two-bedroom.

Overall there are still more long-term rentals available in the greater Cincinnati region than short-term rentals. According to Airbnb there are more than 1000 stays available in the greater Cincinnati region. Apartments.com shows at least 2780 listings in the greater Cincinnati region.

The booming short-term rental market is not just a Cincinnati phenomenon. HomeAdvisor a company that partners with Angi recently released a report that highlights which U.S. cities are best and worst for rental investors. While The Queen City doesn't make the list there is a trend that backs up what Henry said Liberty Hill is experiencing: It is more lucrative for investors to buy and operate Airbnb properties in cities that are not considered destination hot spots. Investors get a much better return if operating an Airbnb in Cincinnati than in San Francisco or New York City.

New York City one of the U.S. cities with the most Airbnbs reportedly now has more short-term locations than actual apartments to rent.

The New York City’s Comptroller’s Office published a reportarguing the increase in Airbnbs cost New Yorkers a total of $616 million in additional rent in 2016 as a result of price pressures. Airbnb responded by criticizing the methodology saying it “severely misrepresents the impact of [the] platform on housing.”

Although preliminary research suggests Airbnb short-term rentals do have some kind of impact on housing prices there’s still a lot of debate over how big of a rise it actually is.

What Liberty Hill Rentals (AKA Chris and Chris) is doing is a smaller version of a trend that's happening across the nation and the world.

Tassell said out of 143 million households across the country less than 700000 are short-term rentals and it's not big corporations that are buying all of them up.

""About 10% of homes that have been purchased for rentals are being bought up by large corporations. The majority of it is mom and pop; it's local neighbors reinvesting in their neighborhood. That's 90% of it"" Tassell said.

Despite a recent rental report from Redfin that showed rent increasing 32% in one year Tassell said the Cincinnati area is still one of the most economical regions to rent.

Tassell blames the more pricey rental market on the lack of new building projects.

""There's been some building but with interest rates climbing builders get nervous so they slow down"" Tassell said.

According to Tassell many building companies are extremely conservative because of the 2008 housing crisis.

""The companies that survived 2008 have those scars so they're hesitant to overbuild"" Tassell said.

Locals look out for combination lock boxes outside former fisher’s cottages and converted chapels. Windows are unadorned by the ordinary stuff of family life: there are no toys framed photos or heirloom candlesticks. Instead the properties have winsome if implausible names. “You know what gets me” says Craig ab Iago reversing at high speed down a single-lane road bounded on each side by drystone walls. “There’s no willow here but it’s called Willow Cottage!” Ab Iago is taking me for a tour of the village of Talysarn. “Every other house on this road will be an Airbnb or a second home” he says.

Talysarn and the neighbouring villages of Penygroes and Nantlle were once the centre of the slate industry. In the 1850s horses pulled railway carriages to the harbour at Caernarfon for export by sea. But with the collapse of the industry and the flooding of the quarries in the 1970s the area fell into economic decline. The descendants of former quarrymen migrated for work and their cottages were bought cheaply as second homes. Now the second tranche of out-of-towners hoping to snap up a two-up two-down cottage for a song has arrived in Talysarn: the Airbnb landlords.

“Every year hundreds of thousands of tourists come here and queue to go up that mountain” says ab Iago gesturing in the direction of Snowdon. “And there isn’t necessarily any respect shown to us. A house goes on the market that would be perfect for a local couple and instead it’s Airbnb-ed in a second.” Ab Iago is Gwynedd council’s cabinet member for housing responsible for a £77m seven-year housing plan that aims to tackle Gwynedd’s escalating housing crisis. “It’s like sticking a plaster on a gaping wound” he admits.

Exclusive analysis from the Guardian using data collected by the campaigning project Inside Airbnb reveals that Gwynedd has some of the highest concentrations of Airbnbs in Great Britain* after well-known hotspots including north Devon Cornwall and the Lake District. The Abersoch area for example has the seventh-highest overall with 14 Airbnbs for every 100 properties.

Pre-Covid ab Iago would get a phone call once a month from a constituent asking for help with their housing situation. Now it is every day as 3800 people wait an average of two years for a property on the social housing list. “Most of the time they’re being kicked out of a private-rented house so it can be used for an Airbnb” he says. Those in a position to buy often find themselves gazumped by capital-rich investors hoping to diversify their incomes with an Airbnb property. “No one here can afford to buy a house” says ab Iago. “There are no family homes available. And when they are available they go for £300000.” The average salary in Gwynedd is about £28000.

That day I had visited ab Iago at home in the nearby village of Penygroes. I tell him that my bemused taxi driver had asked me what could possibly bring me to this part of the world; there was nothing he insisted worth visiting in Penygroes. (After the collapse of the quarrying industry the town’s largest employer was a toilet roll factory which went bust in 2020.)“Nobody wants to come here” agrees ab Iago explaining that for a short time in 2016 the village was notorious for the murder of a young mother. Only now they do. There is an Airbnb on the same road as ab Iago’s family home a sloping street of pebbledash houses unlovely other than for their expansive views of the mountains and the Irish sea. “If it’s in Penygroes it’s everywhere” he says sighing.

He insists that he is not anti-Airbnb per se: “Anyone who complains about Airbnbs and is a tourist themselves is a hypocrite. Airbnb is a really useful way for someone to rent out their house. But not in an unregulated system where we’re not building any houses.” And it is certainly true that Airbnb is not the only platform to enable short-term holiday rentals in north Wales. Ab Iago is trying to buy back properties sold off cheaply by the council through the right-to-buy policy. “It’s depressing” he says. A council that has to justify each purchase to the public on the basis of value-for-money cannot compete with cash-rich private investors. “A house goes on the market” says ab Iago. “We look into it. It’s bought that day by someone on the internet for cash. They haven’t ever seen it. We can’t compete with that. Unless we control the planning side of things we are just swimming against the tide.”

In 2021 Gwynedd council imposed a 100% council tax increase on second homes with the intention of dampening the second homes market. (This will increase to 300% from April 2023.) But most Airbnb owners simply designate their home a small business and pay small-business rates which can work out lower than council tax. “We have to accept that” ab Iago says darkly. “Our planning system is just crazy.”

A fortnight after we first speak Wales’s first minister Mark Drakeford sets out a package of planning reforms. The Welsh government will introduce three new planning use classes – primary homes second homes and short-term holiday lets – by the end of the summer. Local authorities will be able to require planning permission to change a property from one use class to another. Airbnb owners will have to apply for a licence to run a holiday let.

When I call ab Iago for his take on the proposals he is less euphoric than I expected. “The fact that we’ve got the government agreeing with us that there’s a problem that’s a massive difference isn’t it?” he says. “It’s the difference between no hope and some hope. But do I think it’s enough? No I don’t.” What is also needed he says is more social housing and genuinely affordable properties for first-time buyers. “We’re in a housing emergency” ab Iago says. “And this isn’t the response to an emergency.”

Across Gwynedd Ian Wyn Jones watches over passing traffic. His smirk is adorned on for-sale signs outside terrace houses and static caravans new-build flats and 1950s bungalows. But despite his ubiquity – I spot a sign every few miles in my drive around the county – the man himself is in poor spirits.

“It’s having a major impact here” Wyn Jones fumes. “It’s not good. He needs to sort himself out. I’ll be honest.” He is referring to Drakeford’s recent announcement which is already dampening the second-home and holiday-let market across Gwynedd. This time last year says Wyn Jones who runs his own estate agency he sold 90% of the properties he listed within a month. This year half haven’t sold. Other estate agents says Wyn Jones are similarly affected. “A lot of people are selling up because they’ve had enough” he says. “I know what Mark Drakeford is trying to do but he’s not doing it right.”

We are meeting in Wyn Jones’s office in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the city of Bangor. His face also stares at me from headed letter paper and a billboard above his desk so that I have the feeling that I am interviewing not one Wyn Jones but several. He insists his objections are not motivated solely by self-interest but concern for the wider good. “I am thinking about the whole economy” he says. “Without tourism in north Wales we have nothing. All these new regulations are just hurdles. People will think: ‘I’ll look elsewhere. I won’t be bothered.’” (Tourism contributes at least £1.4bn to Gwynedd’s economy annually and supports 18244 jobs in the area. However only 16% of all enterprises in the county are tourism-related.)

Pre-planning reforms it was all going well for Wyn Jones. “The market has been absolutely crazy since Covid” he says. About 20% of all the properties he sold says Wyn Jones were for Airbnb purposes. “They were just flying out” he says. “People weren’t even seeing them.” Last year he put on the market a four-bedroom property in Llanberis the hugely popular village used as a base for walkers climbing Snowdon for £350000. It sold within the day to be used as an Airbnb property. Another property a three-bedroom for £200000 “sold in three hours to an Airbnb person” Wyn Jones says. “They drove right across from Manchester to see it.” It is not uncommon for properties to go for £30000 or £40000 above the asking price.

Not all Airbnb properties go to English investors however. Wyn Jones says that he often sells to people from north Wales who are looking to develop a second income. Wyn Jones connects me with one who is trenchant in the face of criticism. “It’s here to stay now” says Adam (not his real name) a 45-year-old investor who owns two Airbnb properties and is in the process of buying a third. “It’s not going anywhere. The people who complain about it – why don’t they try to profit from it? I have friends that clean Airbnbs. They can get £50 a shift. People just want to complain don’t they? The people who complain don’t do anything.”

Before he got into Airbnb Adam rented out his properties to locals. “I had a heroin addict in one house” he says. “Never again.” With Airbnb he says “you get your house back in a few days usually in a good condition”. He is dismissive of the argument that Airbnb investors are pricing out first-time buyers. “The people who complain they want to live in Llanberis” Adam says. “Why don’t they buy a house in Deiniolen for £80000? You can get a 95% mortgage as a first-time buyer. If you can’t find £4000 you aren’t trying very hard.” (According to data from the website On the Market the average price paid for a property in Deiniolen was £146000 up 25.5% in the past year.)

Wyn Jones is more sympathetic to first-time buyers. “When we were first-time buyers we were scared to get an £80000 mortgage” he says. “Now they’re looking at a £150000 to £250000 mortgage straight away. That’s scary.” Is he part of the problem? “To be honest this is how I look at it” Wyn Jones replies. “I dread to think. I have a son; he’s 15. How is he going to get on the property market?” But his solutions appear contradictory. “I want to protect the first-time buyers but I also want to make sure the Airbnbs can come on the market” he says. I suggest those might be irreconcilable ambitions. “Yeah” Wyn Jones shrugs. “That’s the problem. The Welsh government needs to do more. They need to help the first-time buyers more.”

The Welsh government’s efforts to tamp down the Airbnb market through planning reform have attracted blowback from predictable quarters. “Policymaking must acknowledge that not all accommodation providers are the same and not all forms of tourism are created equal” said the tech giant in a statement. “There is a big difference between buy-to-let speculators and hosts who occasionally share their homes on Airbnb to afford the rising cost of living.” It pointed to a 2020 Airbnb-funded study that found that Airbnb visitors supported more than 3500 jobs in Wales. “The majority of hosts in Wales are everyday families who share their primary home and rent their space for just three nights a month on average” the statement went on. “More than four in 10 hosts in Wales say they host to afford the rising cost of living and over a third say the additional income helps them make ends meet.”

“It’s giving people in the local community work” says Zoë Males a 43-year-old Airbnb host from Newtown in Powys mid Wales. “I use a local guy to deliver my firewood. My cleaners are local; they live literally in the next village.” We are sitting outside the two-bedroom property in Trefor that she rents out for £819 a week. The property lies on a picturesque street of stone cottages bisected by a burbling stream bounded by verdant foliage. Ten minutes’ walk away is Trefor beach which lies on the north coast of the Llŷn peninsula a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.

Males bought the cottage at auction last year for £86000 and spent £10000 renovating it. Within 48 hours of launching the listing in June 2021 it was booked out for the summer. She is sanguine about the Welsh government’s planning reforms. “I think if it means we regulate all the houses that are sitting empty then it’s a good thing” she says. She is likewise unfazed by the requirement for Airbnb owners to apply for a licence. “We expect that in a hotel don’t we?”

As we sit outside the cottage in brilliant sunshine listening to the stream I ask Males whether she worries that this street might one day be entirely Airbnb rentals. “If there was a half-and-half mix even that would be fine” she says. Has she experienced any pushback from the community? “Everyone’s been really lovely” she says. “I haven’t had anyone being funny or grumpy about it.” She appears taken aback by the question and asks me where the criticism comes from. Mostly Facebook I respond. “I think with Facebook the people who are sat there all the time just moaning and whinging it’s because they’re not doing anything else” Males says brightening. “I’m really busy.”

There is one thing that everyone I speak to agrees on whether estate agents or locals: no one wants a repeat of Abersoch. “Abersoch is somewhere that has been destroyed not by Airbnb but by second-home owners” says Wyn Jones. “Go there in winter and it’s a ghost town.”

He is referring to the Llŷn peninsula village where a four-bed detached house can fetch £2.2m and beach huts have been known to go for £191000. In 2020 46% of the housing stock in Abersoch consisted of second homes or holiday lets. This year Gwynedd council closed the village’s primary school because there weren’t enough locals to justify its cost.

The next Abersoch will most likely be in Morfa Nefyn just 12 miles away on the north coast of the Llŷn peninsula. Nefyn Bay is calm and clear as beautiful as any beach in Cornwall or Devon. Overlooking the water is a golf club where elderly English ladies drink tea in the morning and gin in the afternoon. When I visit at 5pm dog walkers traipse up from the beach and fishers haul in their whelk catch. A mile to the east lies the more affordable village of Nefyn. “People in Abersoch are selling properties and purchasing in Morfa Nefyn” says Rhys Tudur. “So people in Morfa Nefyn are forced into Nefyn and young people in Nefyn are forced out of the area completely.”

Tudur is a member of Gwynedd council and a former chair of Nefyn town council in addition to being a member of Hawl i Fyw Adra a housing activist group whose name translates as “the right to live locally”. A 31-year-old solicitor Tudur was born and raised in Morfa Nefyn but no longer lives there as property is too expensive. About 22% of homes in the Nefyn area are second homes or holiday lets. Nefyn residents says Tudur have had enough. “They are extremely pissed off. But it’s directed more towards the authorities than anything else. Because they have the power to change the situation.”

Tudur has brought along his fellow campaigner Gruffydd Williams 63 who is also a member of Gwynedd council and was born and raised in Nefyn. The two men make an unlikely double act. Tudur is smartly dressed in a shirt and pressed jeans and speaks carefully like the solicitor he is. Williams is a freewheeling presence in wraparound shades a former art student and squatter who likes to joke about the English but always caveats these jokes by pointing out that his mother is English.

In the afternoon they had taken me on a tour around Morfa Nefyn talking over each other as they pointed out the Airbnbs and second homes. “This one is called Ty Clyd which means ‘cosy house’” said Tudur bitterly of one holiday cottage. “It’s not a cosy house for anyone local.” Outside a three-storey block of flats with glass-fronted balconies Tudur looked disheartened. “I don’t know anybody who lives here to be honest.”

There are 805 properties listed around Nefyn or Morfa Nefyn on Airbnb but no properties available online for long-term rent. “The rented accommodation in the private sector is all getting converted to Airbnb now” says Williams. “People get served a section 21 notice to quit and the painters and decorators move in and lo and behold it’s turned into an Airbnb.” Tudur rejects the argument that Airbnb rentals pump cash into rural communities. “It pisses me off … there should be a distinction between sustainable tourism and tourism that deprives local people of a home” he says.

What becomes apparent from speaking with both men is that Airbnb is simply the latest iteration of a crisis that has plagued Gwynedd for a half-century albeit tech-enabled for a digital age. This is a part of the world that has always been beloved by English second-home owners. In the mid-70s Williams took part in student protests against holiday homes in the village of Rhyd. “We’d smash in and do a sit in” he says dreamily. “The cops would come and mishandle you and throw you into the back of a black Maria [police van].”

In the late 70s and into the 80s the Welsh nationalist group the Sons of Glyndŵr committed a string of arson attacks against English-owned second homes. “One of the first properties to go on fire was up there” says Williams standing on a bench and pointing at the hillside above Nefyn. I ask Williams whether he remembers watching it burn. “No” he says with a grin. “I wasn’t here. Nah. It was nothing to do with me.”

Even if Airbnb has simply accelerated an existing trend that is not to say that this moment does not feel particularly urgent. Both men committed Welsh nationalists see the platform as an existential threat to their identity. These are the Welsh-language heartlands where Welsh is taught as the primary language in schools. Or at least they were – everyone is anxious about what the 2021 census will reveal about the percentage of Welsh speakers still resident in Gwynedd. “It’s all we’ve got left really” says Williams. “The language.” When he hears children speaking in English in the playground it pains him.

“In 10 years will this be an Airbnb village?” says Tudur as soft light sets over Nefyn Bay and children with wet hair gambol on the beach. “I hope not. That’s why we’re fighting as much as we can to preserve what we’ve got. Language is the most important aspect of our culture of the Welsh identity. We will do our utmost to preserve it.”

*The data analysed by the Guardian was for Airbnb whole-property listings as listed as of May 2022 and council-tax registered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYXJnZS5jb20vYWlyYm5iLWxpbmVuLXBvbGljedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Airbnbs That Don't Provide Linen Are A Joke,"Airbnb was founded in 2008 and swooped into the travel industry like an Albatross with an MBA. As of August 2022 it has a market cap of $74.89 billion. Airbnb has many benefits – it’s full of quirky properties and cool experiences you’d never get in a hotel. There’s one thing I hate about Airbnb though and that’s when you have to bring your own sleeping bag or linen.

If you’ll allow me to get up on my soapbox for a moment I have a complaint. I hate it when Airbnbs don’t provide linen. Before you tell me to suck it up: hear me out. This isn’t a comfort-based complaint. I’m perfectly happy sleeping in my car. I regularly brave the evils of economy (tough gig I know). I have no qualms about sleeping in a tent.

But I find it ridiculous that a four-bedroom property on Airbnb equipped with rainforest showers $1000 mattresses a kitchen that puts Masterchef to shame sliding doors its own wooden boardwalk and a garage could possibly draw the line at providing linen.

It seems I’m not alone in my irrational anger with various aggrieved Airbnb users also taking to The Internet over the years to voice their shock that some hosts don’t provide linen. Reddit user u/icycld for instance wrote in 2020: “My partner and I have an upcoming confirmed reservation and we were just told to bring our own towels sheets and pillows for a week-long stay.”

“This would be a massive inconvenience to us. Would it be reasonable to ask for a reduction in price? I understand that there’s extra effort involved in getting the property up to par for covid cleaning standards but we wouldn’t have booked this property at this price if we had to sort our own linens out.”

One response to this summed up how I feel about Airbnb with Reddit user j00xis chiming in: “I have been travelling for decades and even the crappiest hostels I’ve been to provided linens. I didn’t know this was something to even be considered. I think guests will rightfully complain if you don’t provide them because I’m sure the majority of people expect them.”

It wasn’t just this Reddit thread that discussed the phenomenon with the same gripe being aired on Airhosts Forum Quora and Twitter.

I’ve personally never been a huge fan of airbnbs. Hotel breakfast fresh linen every day & whatever toiletries I forget for free…and don’t let them have a complimentary HH.



Yes please. — Culler💎 (@YouNeedMoCuller) May 18 2021

One Airbnb host’s linen query on Airbnb’s Community Centre page provides an insight into the mindset of an Airbnb provider who does not include linen in the price essentially explaining it comes down to saving money and time (for both the guest and the host) and also writing: “It is not unusual in our area for full houses to not offer this type of service.”

Other hosts say it’s fine because guests should check to see if the linen box under amenities is ticked before they make the booking. Another Airbnb host on Reddit said they were concerned that guests damage the sheets with things like sunblock and oil.

Discussion about Airbnb linen on the r/AirBnB Reddit community.

Airbnb’s Help Centre advises hosts that though it’s not required they provide essential amenities in their listing it is strongly recommended because “guests have told us that these are the items they expect for a comfortable stay” and that “when viewing potential places to stay guests are able to see the amenities you offer and filter to only see listings that offer the amenities they feel are important.”

My take? Though it’s cheaper in the long run for hosts to convince guests to bring their own linen the inconvenience factor really can’t be overstated (especially when we’ve had our expectations set in this regard so highly by even the worst hotels). If you’ve got to bring your own linen you may as well save the money and sleep in your car or van (or in a tent on the side of the road).

Since it was founded 13 years ago Airbnb has risen to become a competitive and novel type of travel accommodation. Alongside the many hostel and hotel options Airbnb is a serious consideration for those actively booking their next vacation.

In many ways Airbnb is impressively innovative. The original idea was that any individual could register as a host and rent out their property to those passing through the area. It has allowed luxurious private lodging to be more accessible to travelers who find that hotel rooms are small and bland and that hostels lack privacy. In some coastal cities even private boats can be rented through Airbnb.

Airbnb is a creative idea but sadly its ideals are overshadowed by how terrible it is.

First there is the issue with costs. Airbnbs are not more economic than a hostel or hotel since many of the postings are misleading. On the final screen before securing a booking one can see “service fees” and “cleaning fees” that significantly raise the price.

Despite “cleaning fees” oftentimes the guests are still expected to clean before leaving and sometimes the chore list is tedious and unreasonable. If the guests fail to meet the vague and arbitrary standard of cleanliness the host sometimes will impose a separate cleaning fine or will leave the guests a bad review which diminishes their opportunity to book in the future.

Then there are the hosts. Airbnb was created as a way for private individuals to rent out their properties or free rooms. But now most hosts are either opportunistic proprietors or a company.

This type of relationship introduces ethical problems but also the typical problems with a landlord: occasional invasion of privacy disagreement over responsibilities earning money simply off of owning a property that one doesn’t occupy.

There is even less incentive to respect or demonstrate compassion to the guests since the relationship is not longterm. The ability for guests and hosts to review one another provides some mechanism for accountability but there are various problems with the review process and if you feel you have been unfairly reviewed Airbnb’s ineffective customer service will be slow to evaluate your complaint.

Although hosts are obligated to disclose cameras there is an abundance of stories of surveillance cameras that are intrusive and not well-disclosed in the booking. I can’t think of something less relaxing on vacation than being monitored by a camera to ascertain all rules are being followed.

Somewhere the misconception was created that Airbnb is an easy way to profit off of a property while doing minimal work and delegating most chores to the guests. First cleaning fees and then a list of chores? I would rather stay elsewhere.

Aside from authoritative hosts exorbitant fees and duties Airbnb’s worst problem is that it is unethical.

Airbnb ruins communities by allowing areas zoned for residential housing to be bought and rented to tourists. In touristy areas where there are housing shortages like New Orleans or Montreal Airbnb takes housing away from locals exacerbates the crises and drives up rents.

So when a company is responsible for your Airbnb booking consider how the property is not owned by some snowbird it’s an enterprise that deliberately bought up multiple available properties for the purpose of turning them into an Airbnb profit chain.

For this reason and because Airbnb postings often violate local housing ordinances some cities have heavily regulated Airbnb or in some cases completely outlawed it.

Despite this illegal Airbnb postings exist everywhere. In 2015 an analysis suggested that up to 58% of New York Airbnb listings are illegal.

Whether it’s steep prices antagonistic and lazy hosts or an unethical business model Airbnb’s worth is outweighed by its lack of quality service and harm inflicted to many communities.

Part of the problem is that Airbnb has cornered its market and lacks strong competitors. An “Airbnb” has become a term to describe its specific type of private accommodation. Perhaps with time as local governments react and people see the destructive nature of Airbnb the term will be reclaimed and synonymized with a housing option to avoid on your next vacation.

Otherwise enjoy your vacation away from home spending your time in Venice cooking and cleaning. It sounds appetizing.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day and welcome to the Akamai Technologies second quarter 2022 conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth head of investor relations. Please go ahead.

Tom Barth -- Head Investor Relations

Thank you operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton Akamai's chief executive officer; and Ed McGowan Akamai's chief financial officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on August 9 2022.

10 stocks we like better than Akamai Technologies

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Akamai Technologies wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of July 27 2022

Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information future events or circumstances except as required by law. As a reminder we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that let me turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Tom and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and slower Internet traffic growth. Q2 revenue was $903 million up 6% year over year and up 9% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security and compute businesses which when taken together were up 30% in constant currency.

These two business lines now account for 54% of our overall revenue. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.35 per diluted share down 5% year over year but up 0.5% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later EPS was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year.

Free cash flow was very strong at $223 million in Q2 and it accounted for 25% of revenue. We've been leveraging our financial strength to make substantial investments in enterprise security and cloud computing. We've also used some of this cash to buy back additional stock. In the first half of the year we spent $268 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares.

This puts us on track to go beyond what's needed to offset dilution from employee equity programs this year. I'll now say a few words about each of our three main lines of business: security compute and delivery. Starting with security. Our security solutions generated revenue of $381 million in Q2 up 17% year over year and up 21% in constant currency.

Growth in security was driven primarily by our app and API security portfolio which includes our market-leading web app firewall Bot Manager Account Protector and Page Integrity Manager solutions. Our Zero Trust enterprise security portfolio led by Guardicore also performed well in Q2 with numerous significant customer wins. A leading global provider of financial data concerned about ransomware added Guardicore segmentation solution to the seven security products they already buy from Akamai. A major insurance company in France became a new customer for Akamai when they adopted our Guardicore solution to help meet European financial regulations.

The sale led by one of our carrier partners is indicative of the excitement we're seeing for our Zero Trust solutions among our partners. In Australia's largest telecom provider Telstra expanded their business with us by adding our Secure Web Gateway solution to their portfolio of Akamai products. They told us ""As part of Telstra's journey in delivering fit-for-purpose solutions Akamai has been a key industry partner with network-based anti-phishing malware protection and content filtering. Telstra blocks millions of threats every single day and Akamai is a key partner in that protection."" Overall our Zero Trust solutions delivered $43 million of revenue in Q2 up 59% year over year in constant currency.

This is an area where we're making -- continuing to make major investments and where we anticipate significant future growth. Turning now to compute. I'm very pleased to report that the revenue for our compute product group was $106 million in Q2 up 74% year over year and up 78% in constant currency. As a reminder the compute product group includes Linode and Akamai solutions for Edge computing storage cloud optimization and Edge applications.

A common theme that I heard when I met with executives from around the world in Q2 was their growing concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming large and rapidly increasing shares of their IT budgets. They want more choice in compute and are open to alternative clouds like Linode as a more efficient way to build run and secure their applications. As a result many large enterprises have begun testing the Linode platform including a major U.S. airline one of the world's top gaming companies and a global provider of weather data.

Major media companies in particular expressed significant concerns with their growing use of the giant clouds. Not only are the cost high in part because of the fees from moving data from cloud storage to a CDN for delivery but they're also concerned about their increasing reliance on a direct competitor. As an example I'm very pleased to announce that we recently signed a contract with one of the world's largest media companies to run a critical new workload on Linode. The service is live today and we anticipate that it will generate millions of dollars of annual revenue as their usage grows over time.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to our potential for future revenue growth in compute. Cloud computing is a fast-growing multi-hundred-billion-dollar market. And as we scale Linode to be enterprise grade with pops and hundreds of locations around the world we should be in an excellent position to capture a share of this market particularly from companies that value our industry-leading security and delivery solutions and that don't want to be locked in to more expensive options with a cloud giant that competes against them. Our delivery products generated revenue of $417 million in Q2 down 11% year over year and down 8% in constant currency.

These results were clearly impacted by a continued deceleration in traffic growth among our largest media customers and by the lower unit pricing we provided as part of their recent contract renewals. It's important to note that Akamai remains the market leader in delivery by far. Moreover customer churn in the first half of this year remained at record lows and lost annual revenue from churned accounts in Q2 was even less than in Q1. We also saw some notable delivery customers move business to our platform in Q2 after trying out competing solutions.

No matter which competitor they've been working with they chose Akamai because of our superior performance and reliability. Like many companies we're managing through a time of substantial economic headwinds and uncertainty with escalating inflation the strengthening U.S. dollar growing concerns about a global recession escalating geopolitical tensions and conflicts and a slowing of Internet traffic growth as the world tries to return to normal in the midst of a pandemic. As Ed will talk about shortly I think it's prudent to assume that these headwinds will dampen our growth rates and profitability over the next several quarters particularly in our delivery business which is being impacted by the challenges that many major media companies have recently reported.

Given the enormous market opportunity in front of us we will continue to focus our investment on Zero Trust enterprise security led by Guardicore and cloud computing led by Linode. These investments combined with the economic headwinds I just mentioned will likely result in our operating margin remaining below 30% in the near term. We expect our margins to improve over time as our security and compute businesses continue to grow and account for a larger share of total revenue. In addition we're embarking on several major initiatives to reduce cost and improve operational efficiency that should help return our margins to 30% or better in the medium to longer term.

As Ed will discuss further these initiatives include leveraging Linode to significantly reduce our cloud spend with hyperscalers slowing the capital expenditures for our delivery platform and optimizing our real estate footprint. While these are challenging times to be sure I believe that Akamai is on the right track for long-term growth and success and that we're well-positioned because of our unique global-edge platform our market-leading security and delivery solutions our new compute capabilities which provide great performance at an affordable cost our premier enterprise customer base and our strong financial position and profitable business model. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q2 and our outlook going forward. Ed?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you Tom. As Tom mentioned Akamai delivered another solid quarter in Q2. Q2 revenue was $903 million up 6% year over year or 9% in constant currency. Revenue was in line with our guidance and was led by our security and compute businesses.

As we mentioned on our last call we expected significant foreign exchange headwinds to impact our revenue in Q2. The much stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 3 points or approximately $29 million of revenue year over year and $14 million on a sequential basis. On a combined basis our security and compute businesses represented 54% of total revenue growing 26% year over year and 30% in constant currency.

Security revenue was $381 million and grew 17% year over year and 21% in constant currency with continued strength from our Zero Trust business led by Guardicore. Guardicore delivered approximately $14 million of revenue in Q2. Security represented 42% of total revenue in Q2 which is up 4 points from Q2 a year ago. Compute revenue was $106 million in Q2 growing 74% year over year and 78% in constant currency.

Linode contributed revenue of approximately $32 million in the second quarter. Delivery revenue was $417 million down 11% year over year and 8% in constant currency. It's worth noting that while traffic on our network continued to grow the rate of that traffic growth declined sequentially in Q2. As Tom mentioned we believe that the current macroeconomic environment has had the greatest impact on customers in our media vertical most notably in advertising and gaming.

These challenges are most apparent in our delivery results. Also as we talked about at our Analyst Day in May we started to align our pricing strategy with the new traffic growth rates we have seen on our network over the last two quarters. In addition to scaling back discounts provided upon renewal we decided to turn away some business from a very small number of customers who have extreme traffic peaks compared to their daily usage patterns. While this will result in slightly less revenue it will enable us to significantly lower our network capex as we focus on cash flow from our delivery business to help accelerate our investments in faster-growing areas like compute and security.

Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q2 unchanged from Q1. International revenue grew 6% year over year or 13% in constant currency. Finally revenue from our U.S. market was $477 million and grew 6% year over year.

Going now to costs and profitability. Cash gross margin was 75%. GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 62%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $292 million.

Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%. Non-GAAP operating income was $262 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. It is worth noting that our non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Capital expenditures in Q2 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $104 million.

This was much better than we expected partly due to some Linode-specific capex that pushed from Q2 into Q3 as well as some savings from our strategy of being more selective on certain types of customer traffic. These savings were most apparent in our network capex excluding Linode which was only about 3% of revenue. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $120 million or $0.74 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $216 million or $1.35 of earnings per diluted share down 5% year over year and up one-half of 1% in constant currency.

It's worth noting that foreign exchange negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.07. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 16%. This was about 1.5 points higher than last year. Moving now to cash and our use of capital.

As of June 30 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.3 billion. During the second quarter we spent approximately $165 million to repurchase shares buying back approximately 1.6 million shares. Our ongoing share repurchase activity has resulted in a net reduction in our non-GAAP fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 4 million shares or roughly 2% on a year-over-year basis. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.5 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization.

Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Before I provide our Q3 outlook and an update to our 2022 guidance I want to highlight several factors. First with nearly 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S. foreign exchange continues to be a significant headwind to our reported results. At current spot rates our guidance now assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $114 million impact to revenue in 2022 on a year-over-year basis.

As I mentioned previously foreign exchange also impacts our margins and earnings. We estimate FX will negatively impact non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point year over year and non-GAAP earnings by approximately $0.31 for the full year 2022. Second we are incrementally more cautious on the outlook for traffic growth in Q3 and Q4. Based on our year-to-date trend plus what we are hearing from other large Internet companies we are anticipating a slower than usual traffic growth rate for the remainder of 2022.

Third as a result of the expected slower traffic growth rate and our updating pricing strategy that we noted earlier we anticipate capex to be significantly below our previous outlook. Finally as Tom mentioned we expect the more challenging macroeconomic environment to dampen our revenue growth and margins in the near term. When combined with the impact of renewing eight of our top 10 customers in the first half of the year we expect delivery revenue to decline at a slightly higher rate on a year-over-year basis for the next two quarters. As a result of these factors we also expect margins to decline over the near term as well.

We believe strongly in the long-term opportunities in front of us especially in security and compute and therefore planned to continue to invest to exploit the market opportunity in these areas. That said as Tom highlighted we are embarking on several major initiatives to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Potential savings for each of these areas is in the tens of millions of dollars. Specifically we are planning to do the following three things.

First significantly reduce our cloud spend with hyperscalers as we migrate internal Akamai workloads to Linode. Second realized savings from our strategy of being more selective on certain types of customer traffic which we expect will result in both lower capital expenditures and depreciation expense. And third optimize our real estate footprint as the hybrid work experience becomes more permanent. Now turning to our Q3 guidance.

We are projecting revenue in the range of $868 million to $883 million or up 1% to 3% as reported or 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q3 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $11 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a negative $36 million impact year over year. At these revenue levels we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. In the short term our gross margin is negatively impacted by our continued investment in Guardicore and the Linode-related headcount as well as higher third-party cloud costs.

However we are confident that this is a short-term impact only. We expect our gross margin to expand to the high 70% long-term target model as we see continued strong growth from both Guardicore and Linode as we reduce our third-party cloud costs over time. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $283 million to $291 million. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 41%.

We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $125 million to $128 million and we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27% for Q3. As mentioned previously the near-term decline in operating margin is due to slower traffic and revenue growth our annual merit-based wage increase which become effective July 1 the negative impact from foreign exchange investments associated with Guardicore and Linode and increased third-party cloud costs. As our security and compute business continue to grow and we reap the benefits of the cost savings actions I described earlier we are confident that our operating margins will return to 30% and then grow from there. Moving on to capex.

We expect to spend approximately $109 million to $119 million excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the third quarter. This represents approximately 13% of projected total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.21 to $1.26. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $38 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16%.

It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year we now expect revenue of $3.57 billion to $3.61 billion which is up 3% to 4% year over year as reported or up 6% to 8% in constant currency. We continue to expect security growth of approximately 20% in constant currency for the full year 2022. We now estimate non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 28% to 29% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.19 to $5.37.

And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares. Finally full year capex is anticipated to be approximately 12% to 13% of revenue. In closing while the macroeconomic backdrop has become more uncertain we believe that we are in the right markets with differentiated products that remain highly valued by our customers. Thank you.

Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] The first question is from James Breen of William Blair. Please go ahead.

James Breen -- William Blair -- Analyst

Thanks. Can you just talk about obviously the revenue guidance for the third quarter is lower than where consensus by about $10 million? Can you talk about the trade-off between margins and going after some of this delivery traffic in general because it's -- the EBITDA margins are about the same but obviously the growth is slowing at the top line.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Hey Jim. This is Ed. So in terms of the guide there's really two pieces to it.

The first one is obviously FX has gotten incrementally worse. That's probably about half of the delta. The rest of it is the slower traffic that we talked about. I think your question was specific to the trade-off that we're making.

The first immediate impact that you get on that trade-off from taking less of that peak traffic as you save on capex. So that will make its way through the P&L through lower depreciation and obviously immediately through cash flow. And so the decision that we've made is obviously as we talked about in May as traffic levels have come down the discounts that we offer upon renewal are lower. And in some cases we've seen a small handful of customers that have the traffic.

Their peaks are still growing at pretty significant rates but their day-to-day traffic is not. So there's a formula that we go through in a trade-off that we made that I think makes a lot of sense for us especially as I look at the types of returns we can get from the faster-growing areas like security and compute.

James Breen -- William Blair -- Analyst

So the shift in general just to a more -- a little bit more of an asset-light business and focusing on some of these other areas?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I mean I would say obviously compute can be I wouldn't call it an asset-heavy business but it does have a fair bit of capex. We talked about our capex for Linode being about 2% of revenue in total. And obviously it's going to be a little bit front-end loaded.

We actually took the advantage to try to spend a little bit more for Linode. Based on some of the conversations we're having we're starting to see some good demand. And obviously Tom talked about signing a pretty significant customer in the quarter. So what we're doing though on the Akamai of course I call it the legacy Akamai delivery business is we are being a bit more selective in reducing capex.

I made a comment that our network capex excluding Linode was 3%. That's typically around call it 8% to 10% at least where it's been running over the last couple of years. So I think it's just a question of being more selective with certain types of traffic. It's really a handful of customers that have that type of traffic pattern.

It's generally event driven. And what we're seeing is it's just a better return to shift some of that investment in other places.

James Breen -- William Blair -- Analyst

Great. And then just maybe just one for Tom. On Linode can you just talk about some of the success you're having sort of selling that product into your existing customer base?

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Obviously very early days. We've got a lot of work ahead of us with Linode as we've talked about. But it's great to land our first very large customer putting a critical app.

Actually it's for transcoding user content onto the Linode platform. As I mentioned that's just that app alone as it scales is worth several million dollars a year of revenue for us. And tip of the iceberg this is a customer that spends many hundreds of millions of dollars a year on cloud computing. And that's just one customer.

So a lot of good opportunity ahead and we're making good progress on our road map for Linode.

James Breen -- William Blair -- Analyst

Great. Thanks.

The next question is from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. We've seen some security vendors report here and security is going through kind of actually still a strong environment despite the macro. And when I look at your normalized rate of about 17% it's a bit lighter than what we saw in Q1 in the last couple of years really.

What's going on especially on the core WAF and DDoS and in Bot management in terms of the sizing and growth against some of the newer solutions like EAA and PIM here? And is there a way to think about if you guys are seeing any higher net churn overall or how to balance net new business versus the expansion that you're seeing with your existing customers and security?

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

I'll start with that and then maybe Ed will add some comments. Security is very strong. We have the market-leading WAF by far. In fact you look at their most recent Magic Quadrants and analyst ratings and we've widened the gap with competition.

Bot Manager also the market leader by far. Now we have Account Protector built on top growing very well. EAA is small today good opportunity for growth particularly coming on the following Guardicore. Guardicore very exciting.

You think about the enterprise security landscape and our segmentation I think has been something that historically was overlooked mainly because it wasn't done very well. But I think as you look to the future it's probably the most important thing an enterprise can do. You could buy everybody's security products today a company could buy everything. And now we're still going to find a way in somewhere.

And the real key is to identify when the malware has gotten inside where it is and block it from spreading. And that's why Guardicore is the best defense against malware and ransomware and they have the best solution as rated by analysts and we see really good traction there but still on relatively small numbers. Page Integrity Manager a relatively new product but a very bright future. Again it's new so it's still small today but that's going to allow companies to satisfy the new PCI requirement something that's hard for a company to do on their own.

The new requirements say that a company has to have safeguards against malware that gets into the digital supply chain and winds up on their users' browser. And that's just very hard for any enterprise to do. But when Akamai is delivering that content we can place our scripts on the page to make sure that the user experience is safe and to make sure that if the user has ingested malware somewhere in the supply chain that we can identify and block it so the user is not compromised. So I think when you look at our security product portfolio really doing very well and we're in early days with some of the most exciting products that have a lot of future runway.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Got it. And maybe for Ed on the delivery side Ed you alluded to a handful of customers that you guys essentially don't really want to deal with going forward just in terms of the type of traffic that you're delivering for them versus obviously the peaks versus the average. Taking a step back what are you seeing in terms of this new pricing strategy versus kind of the churn as well as how to think about this removal of customers on the second-half guide and if it really impacts the security business going forward?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Great question Jim. So let me just clarify that we're not doing business with these customers just kind of taking a step back like I say it's a handful of customers. And typically what you look at is these are multi-CDN customers that use many different vendors and tend to have big peaks for events.

And the way you look at those customers is there's a certain amount of day-to-day traffic you get a certain price point that you're willing to sell at and there's a certain peak to average ratio that you're looking at. So as we go and renew some of these customers we're being a lot more disciplined in terms of the -- taking a different approach as far as the level of discount that we're willing to provide. So therefore the customer has to make a decision about still using us but how are they going to handle those peaks? then going to straighten them out over a longer period of time try to find additional peak in the market etc. So they're still very big customers of ours but we are pushing back a bit in terms of how much peak we're willing to take on the network.

And as a result we may lose a little bit of that day-to-day traffic but we're still a significant vendor. As far as the impact on security and other products we have not seen any impact on that. We're not losing these customers. They're not leaving the platform.

It's just -- we are holding the line a bit more on price and we may lose a little bit of the delivery as a result. But we're also losing a lot of that big peak and that ratio is getting more in line with what makes more economic sense.

James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

That's very helpful guys. Thanks.

The next question is from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Please go ahead.

Rishi Jaluria -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Oh wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe first I want to touch on security. So you've obviously been talking a lot about the delivery business.

But we've seen a pretty decent decel in security this quarter relative to last quarter even looking on a constant currency basis. And look on a constant currency basis you saw only less than $6 million added sequentially from Q1 to Q2. And what should be a pretty strong security spending environment at least based on what others in the space are saying. Can you maybe just help us understand what's going on in the security business and just how we should be thinking about that going forward? And then I have a follow-up.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Rishi sure. So I'll take that. Keep in mind if you remember last quarter we talked about Guardicore revenue having about $7 million of one-time license revenue which was a pull forward of about 1% or so of growth into that quarter. So that impacted it as well.

We are -- one other thing to keep in mind too if you recall with our [inaudible] business during 2020 and 2021 we had a pretty strong uptick from the educational vertical. And there that was when kids were working from -- sorry working from home doing school from home. And there was some government funding that was enabling folks to be able to work or go to school remotely and that funding has gone away. So we've seen a little bit of a decline there.

I think it's a combination of those two factors that led to a little bit lighter of a sort of a sequential growth quarter over quarter. But some of the other things that we're seeing underlying our business we're seeing very strong demand in Bot Manager. Account Protector is a newer version of that product or an add-on. That's going pretty well but it's still pretty early days.

It takes a while for that to -- good to add to growth. But those are some factors that you need to consider as you think about the slowdown in the growth there.

Rishi Jaluria -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got it. That's really helpful. And then just maybe I want to be explicit about macro in the guidance. When we think about your guidance you talked about all the moving pieces between customers and turning [inaudible] piece of the business and all that kind of stuff.

But I want to be explicit what are you assuming in terms of the macro environment? Are you assuming it kind of stays as it is today? Or are you seeing some sort of macro degradation? And maybe to really round that out right? If I think about your last true recession that you are around for right '08'09 even though traffic continued to grow at a nice rate during those years. Pricing compression led to a pretty big decel I know this is obviously a very different business than it was 15 years ago. But maybe I just want to understand your macro assumptions and maybe tied into the macro assumptions what you're assuming for the pricing environment. Again consistent with what you're seeing worse better? Any color there would be helpful.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Yeah. So let's see I'll start with pricing. So one of the things -- the biggest area where you see pricing impact the business is on delivery.

We don't see the typical price declines that you would expect to see in the security business. The business just doesn't work that way. And I don't anticipate that being a significant problem for us. Obviously we're anticipating that traffic is not going to recover to growth rates like we've seen in the past.

We said that in our prepared remarks. So kind of a muted -- more muted Q4 than we typically see. Q4 tends to be a strong quarter for us. We anticipate that the macroeconomic environment is not going to get any better.

One of the areas that I'm keeping a close eye on is Europe. We're seeing a lot of challenges in Europe seeing energy prices for example are really really high over in Europe. We're coming into the winter session. So you could see potentially less graphic related to people cutting subscriptions or doing things like that less shopping online.

So that's one of the things that I'm concerned about. And then also the recession and the impact that it could have on our customers potentially delaying buying decisions and things like that. But obviously we're producing a tremendous amount of cash. The business is in great shape.

It's much more well diversified than in the past. So I think we'll weather the storm pretty well. But I do think as Tom and I both mentioned in our prepared remarks that it is going to dampen our revenue growth a bit here and also our margins for a short period of time.

Rishi Jaluria -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

All right. Got it. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

The next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thanks. This is Josh Baer on for Keith. Appreciate the question. I wanted to ask about Linode.

Are these enterprises that are testing out the platform? Are they considering Linode as primary cloud vendor? And I guess assuming it's a multi-cloud strategy approach what are some use cases that enterprises are testing with Linode? What types of workloads or products do you expect to be popular with enterprises?

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Well really any kind of cloud compute application is suitable for Linode. Obviously we support containers as a service VM as a service. So anything you do in the cloud you could do on the Linode. I think the use cases initially and how the customers are viewing it as trying it out with some new applications and in the one case of the media company we talked about it's a critical application.

They're running their new transcoding app for user-generated content on us. It's about as critical as it gets. And as I mentioned that may become worth millions of dollars as it scales up but this is a company that's spending many hundreds of millions of dollars in the cloud. So it's not a situation where we think you're just going to switch all that on to Akamai right away.

But it is a business that I think we can really grow and that we're in an excellent position to tap into a very large cloud computing market. That market is a couple of hundred billion dollars growing at a very rapid clip. And Akamai is a trusted partner for many major enterprises that are looking for some diversification that want a reliable partner has great performance which we do with our distributor platform knows how to handle scale and at an affordable price point which we're in an excellent position to provide. So I'm really optimistic about the future of our compute business.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Great. And it sounds like a lot of the focus is on the hyperscalers and the enterprise opportunity. Just also wanted to ask if you're seeing any changes in the competitive landscape around some of the other alternative cloud providers serving SMB just in regard to any pricing changes or any other moving pieces in the market.

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Well as you know one of our competitors there raised pricing. And I would say so far there's not a big change in the competitive landscape in the SMB market. We do intend to offer other services such as security to that customer base. But I think the real focus for us is bringing -- upscaling Linode to make it really enterprise -- major enterprise grade and scaling it out and making it be much more distributed which will obviously improve performance.

And going after the large enterprises many of our customers spend 10 or more times as much with the major clouds than they do with us for delivery and security. And so that's a great opportunity for Akamai to be able to now provide them with compute as well so that they can build their apps on Akamai run them obviously deliver and secure them on Akamai. Really an incredible opportunity.

Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

The next question is from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Great. Thank you. Can you just be a little bit more clear? Some of the -- you mentioned the media companies and the issues with some of the traffic slowing down. Do you think this is more of a near-term issue or seasonal? And then how long do you think before some of that traffic begins to come back a bit?

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. As we mentioned there's a variety of factors that are impacting the media companies and hence traffic. You've sort of got a year -- I mean we still got COVID but this is more like a non-COVID year lapping a COVID year. And so people are out and about more and so there's less traffic growth due to that.

You've got impacts of what in some places is a recession. And you've seen some of the media companies report that they've got their own challenges with usage. And so that tends to reduce traffic. Obviously we've got foreign exchange headwinds which impacts the revenue we get from media companies overseas.

And so all of that is impacting traffic in the media business for Akamai. I don't see those as being permanent. And we do expect over the long term that the traffic returns to more normal growth rates and that the revenue for the delivery business stabilizes. May take a little while several quarters at this point but I don't think it's a long-term phenomenon.

Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- Analyst

OK great. And can you quantify how much capex you might be saving annually from sort of the pushing out some of the higher volume folks?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. So probably the best way to think about that if you remember coming into the year we were sort of guiding that 15% to 16% range. We said Linode will be a couple of points. We're now down to 12% to 13%.

So that's somewhere in the 3% to 4% range is probably a good number to be working with. I also gave the data point out that our network-only sort of legacy Akamai delivery business or Akamai network capex is around 3% where typically it had run around 8%. Now we'll obviously you still have to invest in the network and we expect traffic to grow etc. But I think we can remain in a lower than sort of long-term trend model here for a while.

Obviously if we see significant increase in traffic we'll obviously have better delivery results and deal with it at the time. But kind of looking out over the next several quarters and into next year I'd expect to see the capex levels at sort of levels you're seeing here.

Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- Analyst

All right. Great. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Fatima Boolani of Citi. Please go ahead.

Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst

Thank you for taking my question. Ed this was for you just with respect to a lot of the detailed commentary on your expectation of the delivery franchise for the second half. So a number of moving pieces here. But what I want to focus on is maybe doubling back to some of your comments from the last earnings call with respect to the observations around gaming traffic slowing down.

So I am inferring up the bulk of the pain that you're talking about from a delivery standpoint is purely coming from the OTT side but I'd love to kind of get a confirmation and maybe get more of an in-depth under the hooded view of where you're seeing the most I guess elasticity or volatility from a traffic type standpoint? And how you're thinking about those trends in maybe a more granular fashion in the back half especially on the back of the renewals that are now behind you?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah good question. So let me just try to answer it this way. Obviously our largest source of traffic is video traffic. And we are seeing video traffic the growth rate of that is slower than we had expected.

Still growing but slower than we expected. Probably the more noticeable areas would be gaming software and then advertising-related so some of the portal news portals etc. that sort of stuff that are impacted by advertising that's the area. But if you have a slowdown in video it's such a significant portion of traffic that can tend to be the biggest driver. Now will that recover? What we typically see in Q4 is we do see somewhat of a device cycle where you see new devices coming online oftentimes you see new content that comes on in Q4.

There's back-to-school. There is the start of the fall sports season that we typically see a big increase in traffic. What we're looking at this year is we're being more cautious. We're still expecting it to increase like we see in Q4 but just not at the levels that we've seen in the past just based on the trends that we're seeing in the market today what we're hearing from other companies what we're getting from our customers.

But that's probably the best way to think about it.

Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst

I appreciate that. And just really quickly on the macro commentary that you shared especially with some of the key observations in Europe. I'm curious about any concerns or observations with respect to sales cycle elongation deal decision -- delays in deal decision and deal making from a procurement standpoint anything tangible that you can share with us just with respect to those dynamics just as the broader economy sort of softened.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

It's a good question. I'd say it's still kind of early days but that's certainly something that we're looking at. Security tends to be one of the places that you wouldn't delay a purchase especially if you're under an attack. If you're not under attack sometimes you might elongate that a little bit.

But we haven't seen anything yet that's worth calling out in terms of elongating the sales cycles. I think I'm more concerned with what happens going into the winter and there's talk of cutting back use of natural gas and the impact on GDP that obviously would have an impact on not just Akamai but on many many companies. So that's something you look out for. And then also just as you get into a situation like that keeping a close eye on receivables and making sure that you not -- your customers are in good financial health.

So far no issues there but that's again something that we'd be looking out for.

Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst

Thank you so much.

The next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.

Tim Horan -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Thanks guys. Questions on Linode. How much can you save enterprises do you think on their compute bill with Linode? Secondly is this a good run rate for the compute segment or maybe any color on what the growth rates you're kind of looking for there?

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. The savings can be substantial. The list pricing that we offer for Linode is substantially less than when you see the hyperscalers offering that's public information. And for major enterprises obviously you can have some discount to that.

And the really good news is that we believe we can do this at substantial margins. So as we grow the business actually they'll improve our margins overall. And Ed do you want to take the second part of that?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So in terms of the run rate and the growth expectations yes I mean I think in terms of the near-term run rate that's probably a reasonable place to peg it. What Tom and Adam talked about in May at our Analyst Day is we're making some substantial upgrades to the capabilities that Linode has that doesn't happen overnight. So really we will start to see -- the big enterprise growth will be into '23 and the back half of '23 '24 etc.

But we do expect pretty substantial growth here obviously grew 74-plus percent in compute but a good place to put it for now but it will take some time to build out the capacity as well as the added features. We're going as Tom said at a pretty good pace here but that's when you really start to see the exciting growth is once all that capability is up and available.

Tim Horan -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

The next question is from Rudy Kessinger of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.

Rudy Kessinger -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. So for the balance of the year you're taking the revenue guide down by $55 million. You said FX headwinds for the year now at $114 million versus $100 million previously.

So ex that FX headwind you're taking it down by $41 million. I'm curious if you could kind of bucket it out that $41 million reduction between lower traffic growth outlook or macro challenges versus maybe some of the revenue you're losing from potentially taking less traffic from some of those customers with high peaks or other areas where you're reducing the guide.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I'd say the majority of it comes from the slower traffic. That's going to be the biggest component of it. The impact for some of the traffic we're turning away isn't all that significant but does contribute to it.

I don't have an exact percentage for you but that's not a significant part of it. And then the macroeconomic would be the remainder. So if you were to stack rank it would be slower traffic macroeconomic and then the impact from turning away some of the traffic that we talked about in terms of the peaky traffic.

Rudy Kessinger -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

OK. And then on Linode I guess I'm curious like what is your total internal spend with the hyperscales currently? What percent do you think you could move to Linode over time? And what's the kind of expected cost savings you think you can get from that?

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We're spending about $100 million a year annually now with the cloud companies. And over the next year or two ultimately we would migrate pretty much -- most all of that on to Linode. And substantial savings.

So that's why it's one of our several initiatives we're taking to improve margins. Also it's great to be using our own services and it will help us as we do the work with Linode to make it enterprise-ready to be using it across the spectrum of applications at Akamai. We're very much like our customers and looking for ways to save on cost and get great performance out of our cloud compute platform.

Operator

The next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.

Jeff Van Rhee -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great. Just a couple for me. I think on the security side I just want to clarify I know you said you're comfortable at 24% revenue growth. To be clear as reported or constant currency and then just kind of the puts and takes of being able to sustain that 20% in the outyear given kind of the deceleration we're seeing right now?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I'll take the first part Tom you can take the second part in terms of the future. That's in constant currency. And just remember Jeff that the Guardicore acquisition anniversary is in the fourth quarter.

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And in terms of the longer range obviously we're seeing very good growth in our flagship products Web App Firewall and Bot Manager. They're the largest contribution of revenue. Really good growth but on smaller numbers obviously for Zero Trust enterprise computing.

In the longer time frame I think that's what drives a lot of the growth in security. The infrastructure category growing more slowly today also on a moderate size number. But I think in the long term you see the enterprise Zero Trust security group grow led by Guardicore as the market leader in stopping ransomware.

Jeff Van Rhee -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

So I guess as a bucket no clear sort of things you would call out that should drive acceleration or deceleration maybe a different way to look at it.

Tom Leighton -- Chief Executive Officer

Well there's the three categories we have today. The biggest is app in API security very strong growth. I think we get continued strong growth there. A lot of innovation going on with Account Protector Page Integrity Manager we talked about being really important for PCI compliance.

We have a new audience hijacking prevention capability that looks really cool. Infrastructure is moderate size today and that's not growing as fast. That's your DDoS protection and your D&S defenses. And then the really high-growth area Zero Trust enterprise security led by Guardicore but it's the smallest of the 3.

And so you sort of have three different comps with a little bit different dynamic in each.

Jeff Van Rhee -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

OK. And one last if I could on delivery. Obviously you're making some changes around the peaking traffic. What about pricing disciplines just in traffic in general? I think you had commented last quarter you were taking a much more sort of across-the-board conservative approach to pricing.

Just pricing outside that peaking how has your approach changed this quarter and likely to change the rest of year?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. So we've been instituting that now for the last several months. And as Tom talked about we have not seen a lot of churn. We've been fairly successful in the renewals that we've had.

We are still offering discounts to customers who have traffic growth. It's just not at the same levels that we've done historically.

Jeff Van Rhee -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Yeah. OK. Fair enough. Thank you.

The next question is from Will Power of Baird. Please go ahead.

Charles Erlikh -- Baird -- Analyst

Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. It's Charlie Erlikh on for Will. Just one question for me on the pricing and contract renegotiations kind of building on your response.

Any big contracts coming up for renewal that we should be aware of in the second half? And then for the 8 that you mentioned you had in the first half any more color on just the tone and the overall discussions like pricing compression you mentioned a little bit but just the health of the customers you're talking to and just any more color on that would be great.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah sure. So there's no big ones coming up in the second half. Like I said if we ever have a big clump in the -- we'll call it out for it. I think it's just helpful to provide commentary and get you guys aware of what's happening.

In terms of the dynamics outside of pushing back a little bit on sort of the peak to average which is part of the normal discussion that we have I would say we're kind of came in line with what we had expected. We did try to apply our strategy of being a bit more disciplined. I don't know if that's the right word but more attuned to what's going on with volumes and having conversations with customers about expected volume growth etc. So pleased with where we landed.

And obviously renewing large customers and this -- and the delivery segment is never a fun thing. But kind of came out as expected. And then your other question was on -- just remind me again?

Charles Erlikh -- Baird -- Analyst

I think you actually hit all the questions yes just the overall tone of the conversations. But yes I think you answered it pretty well.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. So overall I mean the customers are still in great shape. There are some very large brands and still very healthy. We added services to most of them.

So not only are we just dealing with delivery but we're also adding on additional capabilities as well.

Charles Erlikh -- Baird -- Analyst

Great. Thanks.

The next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead.

Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Thanks. So given both Guardicore and Linode have not been in the full for over a year I was wondering if you could look at them from the perspective of apples-to-apples if they had been in the fold for the entire year what their internal growth rates look like so that we have some gauge of the rate of growth at those two acquisitions.

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. It's a good question Alex. I'll take this one Tom. So Linode so Linode will end up being in for most of the year.

But just prior to acquisition we had said in our commentary they're growing around 15%. Obviously we'll accelerate that as we start to add enterprise customers. So I'd expect that to increase. With Guardicore if you remember our first call we're taking our guidance up quite a bit but if you look at where our kind of internal -- where our run rate is now we're looking at over $60 million.

That would be almost a doubling of where they were when we acquired them even slightly higher than that. So Guardicore growing extremely fast I would say sort of if it was a stand-alone on its own would be more than a double. And Linode we just picked it up and its starting to add that functionality and expect to accelerate that growth rate but they were about 15% prior to acquisition.

Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

There was a comment earlier in the call that adjusting for acquisitions the underlying growth rate was 17%. Would you confirm that that's an accurate calculus?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. That's about the right math. 21% constant currency. Guardicore was about $14 million.

So that's roughly 4%. So that's about right.

Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Perfect. And then just looking at the international markets how are you handling the FX swings that are going on? In terms of pricing are you offsetting and look the effective price reduction that implies in dollars if you're in local currency and where you're not in local currency are you pricing down to lower the burden? How are you handling the customer pressures around that?

Ed McGowan -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. So most of the customers outside the U.S. are paying us in local currency. So they're billed in local currency.

There are several that are not certain countries for example will be in U.S. dollar. So far it has not been a big issue with our customers pushing back. We do some hedging on balance sheet but not from an operational perspective not cash flow hedging.

And then in terms of pricing we do take that into consideration as we're going through with customers that are outside the U.S. And also just in general depending on where their traffic is that also comes into effect. If we're delivering in countries that are more expensive we take that into effect as well.

Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

OK. Thanks.

Tom Barth -- Head Investor Relations

OK. Thank you Alex and thank you everyone. So in closing we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the third quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.

Thank you for joining us and all of us here at Akamai wish continued good health to you and yours. Have a nice evening.

Now he has received government funding to expand and service more customers in Washtenaw County.

Ars Technica:

Operating an ISP isn't Mauch's primary job as he is still a network architect at Akamai. He started planning to build his own network about five years ago after being unable to get modern service from any of the major ISPs.

As we wrote last year AT&T only offers DSL with download speeds up to 1.5Mbps at his home. He said Comcast once told him it would charge $50000 to extend its cable network to his house—and that he would have gone with Comcast if they only wanted $10000. Comcast demands those up-front fees for line extensions when customers are outside its network area even if the rest of the neighborhood already has Comcast service.

Mauch was using a 50Mbps fixed wireless service before switching over to his own fiber network. In addition to his home Internet customers Mauch told us he provides free 250Mbps service to a church that was previously having trouble with its Comcast service. Mauch said he also provides fiber backhaul to a couple of cell towers for a major mobile carrier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtyZWFkaW5nLmNvbS9hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1zZWN1cml0eS9yZXNlYXJjaGVyLWF0LWJsYWNrLWhhdC1kZXNjcmliZXMtbmV3LWh0cHAtcmVxdWVzdC1zbXVnZ2xpbmctYXR0YWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New HTTP Request Smuggling Attacks Target Web Browsers,"BLACK HAT USA – LAS VEGAS – A security researcher who previously demonstrated how attackers can abuse weaknesses in the way websites handle HTTP requests warned that the same issues can be used in damaging browser-based attacks against users.

James Kettle director of PortSwigger described his research as shedding new light on so-called desync attacks that exploit disagreements in how a website's back-end and front-end servers interpret HTTP requests. Previously at Black Hat USA 2019 Kettle showed how attackers could trigger these disagreements — over things like message length for instance — to route HTTP requests to a back-end component of their choice steal credentials and invoke unexpected responses from an application and other malicious actions. Kettle also has previously shown how HTTP/2 implementation errors can put websites at risk of compromise.

Kettle's new research focuses on how threat actors can exploit the same improper HTTP request handling issues to also attack website users and steal credentials install backdoors and compromise their systems in other ways. Kettle said he had identified HTTP handling anomalies that enabled such client-side desync attacks on sites such as Amazon.com those using the AWS Application Load Balancer Cisco ASA WebVPN Akamai Varnish Cache servers and Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.

The main difference between server-side desync attacks and client-side desync is that the former requires attacker-controlled systems with a reverse proxy front end and at least partly malformed requests Kettle said in a conversation with Dark Reading following his presentation. A browser-powered attack takes place within the victim's Web browser using legitimate requests he said. Kettle showed a proof-of-concept where he was able to store information such as authentication tokens of random users on Amazon in his shopping list as an example of what an attacker would be able to do. Kettle discovered he could have gotten each infected victim on Amazon's site to relaunch the attack to others.

""This would have released a desync worm — a self-replicating attack which exploits victims to infect others with no user interaction rapidly exploiting every active user on Amazon"" Kettle said. Amazon has since fixed the issue.

Cisco opened a CVE for the vulnerability (CVE-2022-20713) after Kettle informed the company about it and described the issue as allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct browser-based attacks on website users. ""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to visit a website that can pass malicious requests to an ASA device that has the Clientless SSL VPN feature enabled"" the company noted. ""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct browser-based attacks including cross-site scripting attacks against the targeted user.""

Apache identified its HTTP request smuggling vulnerability (CVE-2022-22720) as tied to a failure ""to close inbound connection when errors are encountered discarding the request body."" Varnish described its vulnerability (CVE-2022-23959) as allowing attackers to inject spurious responses on client connections.

In a whitepaper released today Kettle said there were two separate scenarios where HTTP handling anomalies could have security implications

One was first-request validation where front-end servers that handle HTTP requests use the Host header to identify which back-end component to route each request to. These proxy servers often have a whitelist of hosts that people are allowed to access. What Kettle discovered was that some front-end or proxy servers only use the whitelist for the first request sent over a connection and not for subsequent requests sent over the same connection. So attackers can abuse this to gain access to a target component by first sending a request to an allowed destination and then following up with a request to their target destination.

Another closely related but far more frequent issue that Kettle encountered stemmed from first-request routing. With first-request routing the front-end or proxy server looks at the HTTP request's Host header to decide where to route the request to and then routes all subsequent requests from the client down to the same back end. In environments where the Host header is handled in an unsafe way this presents attackers with an opportunity to target any back-end component to carry out a variety of attacks Kettle said.

The best way for websites to mitigate client-side desync attacks is to use HTTP/2 end-to-end Kettle said. It's generally not a good idea to have a front end that supports HTTP/2 and a back end that is HTTP/1.1. ""If your company routes employee's traffic through a forward proxy ensure upstream HTTP/2 is supported and enabled"" Kettle advised. ""Please note that the use of forward proxies also introduces a range of extra request-smuggling risks beyond the scope of this paper.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9oaW1hcnMtbWFrZXItbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrLXJ1c3NpYW4taGFja2Vycy0xNzMyNTA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HIMARS-Maker Lockheed Martin 'Confident' Against Russian Hackers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/himars-maker-lockheed-martin-cyberattack-russian-hackers-1732504 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9oaW1hcnMtbWFrZXItbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrLXJ1c3NpYW4taGFja2Vycy0xNzMyNTA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While the life sciences sector is experiencing falling stock prices for public companies and fewer financings for private ones the industry continues to enjoy a wave of new activity by developers of laboratory/office sites and by venture capital (VC) funds.

Let’s revisit the life sciences regions that we briefly described and ranked in our June issue of GEN in an article entitled “Top 10 U.S. Biopharma Clusters.”2 In this article we add news and information that clearly indicates that these regions are still booming.

Boston/Cambridge

The nation’s largest biopharma cluster saw Takeda lease about 600000 square feet in June for an R&D center at BioMed Realty’s 585 Third Street property in Kendall Square Cambridge. Also planning a new Cambridge R&D center is AstraZeneca which will consolidate 1500 staffers at the headquarters of subsidiary Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Beacon Capital Partners and Nordblom have proposed a new 295000-square-foot biotech building in Boston next to the BEAT (Boston Exchange for Accelerated Technology) on Morrissey Boulevard. Also in Boston Eli Lilly plans to lease from Alexandria Real Estate Equities the 334000-square-foot 15 Necco Street property for its recently launched $700 million Institute for Genetic Medicine.

San Francisco Bay Area

Eikon Therapeutics will relocate its headquarters within the region from Hayward to Millbrae. The new headquarters will occupy approximately 285000 square feet within the 637000-square-foot Alexandria Center for Life Science. Tenaya Therapeutics in June completed a 94000-square-foot Genetic Medicines Manufacturing Center in Union City 30 miles from its headquarters in South San Francisco—where officials in May approved IQHQ’s plans for a 295000-square-foot R&D building at long-vacant 580 Dubuque Avenue. The new fully electric building will accommodate 842 employees while providing just 346 parking spaces (to encourage public transit use). Earlier IQHQ acquired the Elco Yards property with plans to transform the site into uses that include 600000 square feet of life sciences/office space in downtown Redwood City.

New York/New Jersey

In the Big Apple the New York City Economic Development Corporation anticipates that that an additional 10 million square feet of wet laboratory space will be brought online over the next 10–15 years. That includes a 200000-square-foot property for which construction is set to start next year at 309 East 94 Street a property co-owned by Nuveen Real Estate and Elevate Research Properties. Alexandria Real Estate Equities in June opened its second Alexandria LaunchLabs in the New York City at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center campus. Also in June Regeneron Pharmaceuticals broke ground on a $1.8 billion expansion of its Tarrytown NY headquarters. Finally the New Brunswick Development Corporation is constructing the $665 million 550000-square-foot New Jersey Innovation and Technology Hub.

BioHealth Capital Region (Maryland/Virginia/Washington DC)

Trammell Crow announced plans in May to build an initial 757000-square-foot life sciences campus within Johns Hopkins University’s Belward Campus in Montgomery County MD’s Shady Grove section with potential to expand to approximately 1.6 million square feet across seven buildings. Kite Pharma a subsidiary company of Gilead Sciences received FDA approval in April to begin commercial production at a new 275000-square-foot center in Frederick MD for the manufacture of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies. In Virginia Thermo Fisher Scientific is adding 500 jobs in and around Richmond through a $97 million expansion of clinical research operations and Virongy Biosciences plans up to 70 new jobs by expanding within the Northern Virginia Bioscience Center which opened in March in Prince William County.

San Diego

San Diego—which hosted this year’s BIO International Convention—saw Canada’s Entos Pharmaceuticals expand stateside into a 9600-square-foot R&D site within The Muse at Torrey Pines. Also in June Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) agreed to acquire home-grown Turning Point Therapeutics for $4.1 billion. BMS earlier inked a lease with Alexandria Real Estate Equities for a 427000-square-foot R&D building to rise in University Town Center consolidating regional operations now across four buildings. On San Diego’s Pacific coastline IQHQ is building its $1.6 billion 1.7 million-square-foot Research and Development District (RaDD) and Guardant Health in April leased about 37000 square feet at 10578 Science Center Drive in Torrey Pines where it plans to double its regional staff from 55.

Los Angeles/Orange County

Breakthrough Properties an LA-based joint venture of Tishman Speyer and Bellco Capital in April closed the largest real estate fund ($3 billion) dedicated exclusively to the life sciences. Also in April Pasadena-based Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals joined Vivo Capital to launch Visirna Therapeutics with $60 million and plans to develop four Arrowhead RNAi cardiometabolic therapeutics in Greater China. Beverly Hills-based Kairos Ventures later closed a $58 million third fund focused on life sciences and physical science startups. And Thousand Oaks-based Amgen has sold an 8.2-acre property where the company used run a welcome center. The property was bought for $25.5 million by the Latigo Group which plans to repurpose the site to house up to 333 apartments 20% at below-market rents.

Greater Philadelphia

Warren NJ-based Tevogen Bio opened R&D space at the Wanamaker building in Philadelphia where the University of Pennsylvania chose Longfellow Real Estate Partners to build 455000 square feet of R&D and biomanufacturing space at Pennovation Works a University of Pennsylvania real estate asset. Also in Philly Breakthrough Properties plans 200000-plus square feet of “best in class” life sciences space at the 2300 Market Street block in Center City and Spark Therapeutics is developing a $575 million gene therapy innovation center in University City at Drexel University’s campus. The Center for Breakthrough Medicines is accelerating plans to build the world’s largest cell therapy manufacturing operation in King of Prussia where Exelixis moved 140 staffers into “intermediate term” space rather than Boston/Cambridge MA. A permanent “Exelixis East” hub “in close proximity” is under consideration.

Seattle

At the foot of Seattle’s iconic Space Needle Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation and LPC West broke ground in June on the 197000-square-foot 222 Fifth in South Lake Union set for 2024 completion. Seattle-based Sana Biotechnology now plans to build an 80000-square-foot manufacturing site in Bothell instead of in the San Francisco Bay Area—a change expected to save $100 million. Several developments involve Bothell-based Seagen. First Seagen announced plans for a 270000-square-foot manufacturing facility in nearby Everett. Second the company’s president CEO and chairman Clay Siegall PhD abruptly resigned after his arrest on a domestic violence charge. Third a news report appeared that Seagen might be acquired by Merck & Co. which has already partnered with Seagen on two development projects.

North Carolina (including Raleigh-Durham and Research Triangle Park)

Astellas Gene Therapies opened a $100 million manufacturing facility in Sanford in June while Durham-based Precision BioSciences inked an up-to-$1.5 billion collaboration with Novartis focused on in vivo gene editing R&D. Gene therapy developer Kriya Therapeutics (partially in Research Triangle Park) completed a $270 million Series C financing in May. Earlier Amgen broke ground on a $550 million manufacturing plant in Holly Springs where Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies is building a $2 billion cell culture facility. Trinity Capital Advisors and Starwood Capital Group plan to develop Spark LS a $1 billion 1.5 million-square-foot life sciences campus in Morrisville. Finally Eli Lilly plans to open a $1 billion-plus facility in Concord. The facility will be the company’s second manufacturing site in North Carolina.

Chicagoland

Chicago VC firm ARCH Venture Partners in June closed its ARCH Venture Fund XII with $2.975 billion for early-stage biotechnology firms. On Chicago’s South Side a development group called GRIT Chicago plans to break ground on the 500000-square-foot Bronzeville Innovation Center which will house Chicago ARC a life sciences accelerator being developed with Israel-based Sheba Medical Center. Sterling Bay is constructing the $6 billion 53-acre Lincoln Yards property including the 280000-square-foot ALLY at 1229 West Concord life sciences building where work started in October 2021. In April Mark Goodman & Associates acquired the site of its planned 16-story 500000-plus-square-foot lab/office building at 400 North Elizabeth Street in the Fulton Market neighborhood.

That is by far the priciest trade for a San Francisco market-rate multifamily building so far this year and may portend more big sales to come as several other century-old apartment towers are pending sale amid a rental market comeback.

The 42-unit property at 625 Scott Street came to market in April asking $20 million and had four offers according to listing agent Allison Chapleau of Vanguard Commercial who co-listed with Brad Lagomarsino of Colliers International.

The winning bid of about $600 per square foot and $430000 per unit was not the highest offer she said. But it had the best terms for the longtime owner Delta Group a collection of investors who do not own any other buildings together and are approaching retirement age.

The new owner is officially named 625 Scott Street LLC according to public records. Chapleau called the buyer a “local investor” with other properties in San Francisco and the popular NoPa neighborhood. He was willing to waive inspections and agreed to a 30-day close said Chapleau who represented both sides of the deal. It went into contract in May but the close was extended to Aug. 1 to account for vacation and travel schedules she said.

With just over 30000 square feet 625 Scott Street was also the largest apartment building for sale in the city and its sale may kick off a slew of deals for longtime multifamily owners looking to exit now that rents are back up to near pre-pandemic levels. The owners of 901 Pine Street a 29610-square-foot 36-unit apartment building across from the Mark Hopkins Hotel on Nob Hill had held the 1908 property for 25 years before listing in April according to its listing notes. It went into contract in May with an asking price just under $17 million. On June 1 the 25000-square-foot view property at 899 Green Street in Russian Hill held by the same family for generations also came to market with an asking price of $15.5 million. The 38-unit 1923 corner property was in contract three weeks later.

Affordable housing rental complexes have also changed hands this year. SoCal investor Avanath Capital spent $96 million on the 3.6-acre Crescent Cove development next to Caltrain in May. Its 236 units are available to those who make up to 60 percent of the area median income.

About 10 years ago a development organization and a national government took an innovative approach to a problem the fact that people with chronic diseases were stopping their medical treatment before it was complete. After discovering that taking the medicine at the clinic was a major barrier for patients the relatively new behavioral insights team found that allowing people to take the medicine at home (with a doctor or nurse on a camera phone) doubled the number of patients who took the entire course of medication (from 43 to 87 percent).

This was innovation. And yet despite how many more behavioral insights trials have been run by intrapreneurs in this organization—often supported by the in-house innovation team—this kind of behavioral insights is still considered “innovative.” The approach has not (yet) been brought to how business is done on a regular basis.

By contrast in the decade since intrapreneurs in the Western Cape Government in South Africa first initiated behavioral insights trials it has come to occupy a secure place in the government’s toolkit. Public servants know when it’s appropriate to take a behavioral approach and they are supported with in-house expertise and guidance. In a distinct and dramatic sense behavioral insights have been adopted.

The adoption of innovation means an innovation has ceased to be “innovative.” It means that a method technology or approach to a problem has moved from the experimental edges of an organization to the core of its work: no longer a novelty but something normal and institutionalized.

However the concept of adoption is rarely discussed and the experience and know-how to bring it about is even less common. While an increasing evidence base has been developed on adopting digital systems in development and public sector organizations as well as literature on organizational reform little has been published on strategically moving approaches and technologies out of the innovation space to the mainstream of how organizations work. The most relevant insights come from institutionalizing behavioral insights in governments mainly in public sector entities in the global north. This gap makes it all the more important to surface the challenges opportunities and factors that enable adoption as well as the barriers and roadblocks that impede it.

Adoption and Scaling

Adoption is not the same as scaling. Broadly speaking scaling means “taking successful projects programs or policies and expanding adapting and sustaining them in different ways over time for greater development impact” as the authors of the 2020 Focus Brief on Scaling-Up put it. But scaling tends to involve different players and focuses on a specific service product or delivery model. For example SASA! Raising Voices is a community mobilization approach to address and reduce gender-based violence which was first pioneered in Tanzania but after being rigorously evaluated has since then adapted in at least 30 countries by more than 75 organizations around the world.

By contrast the adoption of innovation refers to one organization and how this entity brings what was once novel to the core of how business is done. Take adaptive management in USAID: After first being pioneered in the early 2010s in USAID country missions it has since been tested refined and largely institutionalized as a standard way to design and implement programs. This means it is no longer a novelty requiring a burden of proof; instead adopted approaches are now part of the organizational toolbox. People know what they are when and how to use them and who to ask for help in doing so.

Our work focuses on how a development organization can become an informed user or supporter of a novel approach or technology which is not quite the same as adopting specific services products and delivery models and making them part of what an organization does (as with the Government of Bihar adopting the “Mobile Academy” program for women’s health or UNICEF adopting “Wash’Em” both programs that having already proven their impact could be taken up and expanded elsewhere).

Approaches and technologies that are introduced with an “innovation” label have been harder to adopt. Human-centered design unmanned aerial vehicles behavioral insights and blockchain still largely sit solidly in the innovation space in some cases almost a decade after first trials started within organizations.

Obstacles to Adoption

The lure of novelty: Hype cycles particularly those on emerging technologies can have a disproportionate influence on senior management. But when attention energy and demand shift to the next new thing it can be challenging to keep a focus on “old” innovations that may still need years of time and financial investment to be fully normalized.

Hype cycles particularly those on emerging technologies can have a disproportionate influence on senior management. But when attention energy and demand shift to the next new thing it can be challenging to keep a focus on “old” innovations that may still need years of time and financial investment to be fully normalized. Team traits: Some organizations have dedicated innovation teams that typically commission innovations and offer technical support across the organization. These teams are often overstretched and lack the bandwidth or mandate to focus on the adoption of innovation. Even if they do adopting innovation (as we will see below) demands a skill set more akin to organizational change than innovation while these teams often have little influence on the entire institution and its ways of working.

Misaligned incentives: The organizational metrics to track innovation efforts and investments often incentivize innovations to be labeled as “innovative” rather than normal. For example a multilateral organization’s results framework tracked the number and percentage of “innovative tools and methodologies that are being piloted or scaled” which disincentivizes adoption as the organization seeks to report a high number of projects that test or scale innovative tools and methodologies. For this reason behavioral insights or tools such as satellite imagery will continue to be labeled as “innovative” and there is no metric that incentives moving work with such approaches and technologies out of the innovation space.

This short-term timeframe does not reflect the fact that adoption often takes multi-year investment and support.

In international and local development organizations meaningful innovation is usually advanced by above-average intrinsically motivated individuals pursuing better outcomes for specific place-based challenges. Together these individuals form islands of excellence. When these people move on their ideas and the momentum they have created often leaves with them. Often these individuals prefer to stay below the radar and make good work happen for specific development challenges. Changing an entire organization is not their primary goal.

Often these individuals prefer to stay below the radar and make good work happen for specific development challenges. Changing an entire organization is not their primary goal. Overselling potential: In the bid to promote the adoption of innovation it’s easy to over-sell the potential of methods approaches or technologies. Approaches and methods such as human-centered design behavioral insights or agile management require customization to context and a clear framing of when they add value.

What works?

Some organizations have made good progress on adoption: USAID has worked to institutionalize “Collaborating Learning and Adapting” (CLA); the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) have invested to strengthen institutional capabilities on behavioral insights; the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) have ongoing efforts to enable its staff and partners to utilize blockchain technology; and the French Development Agency (AFD) is aiming to mainstream experimentation across organizational practices through its intrapreneurship program. Other bilaterals are early in their adoption journeys often working on the adoption of approaches like agile human-centered design or behavioral insights rather than technologies. For many the very concept of adoption is still new.

From our conversations with development professionals we have found significant similarities in the journeys of those that have successfully adopted innovation. It’s likely to start with a series of unconnected experiments that are brought into a cohort to learn from one another. The next steps happen in parallel and usually span four to six years:

In partner countries  more experiments take place using the innovation resulting in more evidence on comparative advantage limitations and impact.

 more experiments take place using the innovation resulting in more evidence on comparative advantage limitations and impact. An intentional innovation portfolio is designed to learn in service of adoption efforts. For example if behavioral insights have shown positive effects in the field of governance in middle-income contexts then the portfolio is increased to test how it works in other thematic areas or in countries with other characteristics. This gives information as to whether adoption is the right decision.

For example if behavioral insights have shown positive effects in the field of governance in middle-income contexts then the portfolio is increased to test how it works in other thematic areas or in countries with other characteristics. This gives information as to whether adoption is the right decision. An explicit organizational change process gets underway led by a team with a mandate for the adoption effort. The team formulates a vision for adoption (expresses why it’s important and what difference it will make) sets boundaries (what the organization will and will not work on related to the innovation) and works with partners and allies.

Innovation Characteristics

Before starting the journey to adopt innovation it’s critical to reflect on certain characteristics of the innovation which include:

Relevance : Confidence that an innovation can help address a relevant problem. For example many development efforts require behavior change so behavioral insights might be of value.

: Confidence that an innovation can help address a relevant problem. For example many development efforts require behavior change so behavioral insights might be of value. Observability: Ability to demonstrate and evidence a positive impact from this innovation (compared to how things are done currently). This includes demonstrating cost-effectiveness as it is often easier to unlock smaller amounts for country-level experiments than the multi-year investments in organizational change needed for adoption.

This includes demonstrating cost-effectiveness as it is often easier to unlock smaller amounts for country-level experiments than the multi-year investments in organizational change needed for adoption. Adaptability : Capacity of the organization to adapt and build institutional capabilities. This includes aligned core processes and systems and coherence between old and new ways of working. The successful cases of adoption we observed involved introducing complementary ways of working that align to how people think and behave.

: Capacity of the organization to adapt and build institutional capabilities. This includes aligned core processes and systems and coherence between old and new ways of working. The successful cases of adoption we observed involved introducing complementary ways of working that align to how people think and behave. Sustainability: Resources to enable staff and potentially partners to leverage a specific method approach or technology. Often this means recruiting and retaining specialized staff and building longer-term investments into costing models to sustain new ways of working.

Once confident that the innovation meets these basic characteristics it’s important to articulate and tap into a vision for how to adopt the innovation. What will our organization look like in five years once we have adopted this innovation? Aligning around this vision will build commitment and momentum and create the space to “think backward”: to articulate what needs to happen to reach this vision of the future.

Adoption Factors

We have identified five adoption factors that enable (or inhibit) adoption of innovation. This list is not exhaustive nor are these factors binary (e.g. simply present or not present); they occur on a spectrum even within an organization.

Clear mandate: There is an organizational commitment to adoption. This means there are resources (time and budget) allocated for a team to lead or coordinate adoption (and incentives in place for others to collaborate) while senior leaders model and promote the innovation working to remove barriers to adoption.

This means there are resources (time and budget) allocated for a team to lead or coordinate adoption (and incentives in place for others to collaborate) while senior leaders model and promote the innovation working to remove barriers to adoption. Culture of collaboration and learning: The organizational culture supports adoption. This means collaboration—high levels of connectedness trust knowledge of others’ work and drive to collaborate between different teams or divisions—as well as processes and managers who support people and teams to take risks fail fast learn and share the learning internally and externally.

Context: The organizational context enables adoption. This means alignment with priorities—in which the innovation supports key organizational priorities or is itself a clear priority—as well as an administrative environment in which policies are agile minimal and speak to fundamental values and drivers. This also means procurement and contracting processes are flexible enough to enable experimentation and enable adoption.

Networks allow for uptake and emergence both external and internal. The organization is well connected at all levels with other organizations mainstreaming the innovation as well as internal networks making people aware of the innovation's value and promoting its use across organizational silos. Capacity: Key team members have relevant skills experience and confidence: sufficient experience of managing complexity and organizational change (a different skill set to innovation) as well as experience working in agile and flexible ways and building internal alliances. Key staff are confident to challenge norms try new things and share stories that support adoption.

In our research we found that teams that strategically consider these factors and pursue an explicit vision for the adoption of innovation have achieved considerable progress in their organizations. This includes USAID and the institutionalization of adaptive management the UK FCDO and behavioral insights GIZ and the informed support of blockchain technologies Korea’s International Cooperation Agency and its work on digital technologies and others. The intrapreneurs who pursued adoption efforts all had the intent to move what was once novel out of the innovation space and make it part of their organizational toolkit. They were cognizant to not oversell the potential of novel approaches and emerging technologies and to align applications to core business processes.

In a race that never ends on-product overlay tolerances for leading-edge devices are shrinking rapidly. They are in the single-digit nanometer range for the 3nm generation (22nm metal pitch) devices. New overlay targets machine learning and improved optical overlay systems help speed necessary checks to ensure yield at 5nm and 3nm nodes.

In lithography overlay accuracy has become one of the most critical yield limiters. Overlay control is all about ensuring precise alignment between the features on one mask layers with the one below. For leading-edge nodes like 5nm overlay tolerance — typically 30% of feature size — must be kept below a few nanometers. “Leading memory and logic customers are running 2 to 2.5nm on-product overlay” said Jan Mulkens an ASML fellow.

A typical device might have 50 or more mask levels only some of which are critical and require EUV (13.5nm) while non-critical layers use ArF (193nm) exposure. Key advances at the EUV scanner inspection and algorithm levels work together to deliver tight overlay control and more yielding wafers.

Some of the trends in overlay include:

Movement to longer wavelengths (near IR) to align layers through new hard masks that are opaque to optical wavelengths;

Overlay targets that better mimic the device;

Increased metrology sampling and

ML algorithms to crunch masses of data faster for better inline results.

In addition some inspection tool hardware changes such as chuck improvements help counter bowing effects.

EUV tool-level developments

Obtaining good overlay starts with lithography. The goal of a scanner is to print tiny features with fine resolution as well as to precisely align them. To accomplish that tiny alignment marks are placed on both a wafer and a photomask. In the scanner a wafer stage and reticle stage aligns the appropriate marks with one another. The exposure per reticle is scanned then it steps aligns and exposes the next chip on the wafer until it is fully patterned.

In the litho cell overlay is measured on fairly similar optical metrology systems one positioned after the layer is patterned (after develop inspection) and the second after etch (AEI).

“We’re finding that memory customers seem to be moving faster towards an increased use of after etch inspection rather than in the past when it was a more static thing” said Jim Kavanagh head of application engineering at ASML. “The need to make sure they capture the variances in the etch-induced overlay fingerprint is critical especially in 3D NAND channel holes where variances from wafer-to-wafer lot-to-lot and chamber-to-chamber can be significant. In logic because they have multiple feature types it’s harder to anchor an overlay feature that is representative of the device so they do more at ADI.”

In the fab two to four overlay metrology tools may be used for every EUV lithography system. ASML KLA and Applied Materials provide CD and overlay metrology tools optimized for the two overlay steps. Both image-based overlay (IBO) methods are used as well as diffraction-based overlay (DBO a.k.a. scatterometry) and some systems combine the two techniques. The overlay target has top and bottom gratings so that when imaged at an angle and detected it creates signal differences that correspond with the edge-to-edge differences in images.

Feedback between ADI and AEI as well as input from the scanner’s sensors are used to make overlay corrections. For instance linear corrections in the x and y directions are made as well as rotational corrections. But with advanced lithography and shrinking features the scanner now implements higher-order corrections to reach incredible accuracy requirements.

“During scanning the scanner can correct for translation and rotational errors but it also can handle higher-order corrections” said Chris Mack CTO of Fractilia. Overlay targets in the scribeline around die provide the basis for overlay measurements. “The higher-order errors are things that are more than just what’s going on in the four corners — such as variation in the middle of devices — so the scanning motion of the wafer and mask can implement those corrections. The more measurement points you have the more exacting you can make the movements.”

Edge placement errors

The budget for overlay keeps shrinking not only because feature sizes are getting smaller and mask levels are increasing but because of stochastic effects. The stochastics also impact overlay and CD measurements.

“In the old days CD non-uniformity and overlay were the main contributors to what we call edge-placement errors (EPE). But with scaling and especially double patterning there are multiple components of EPE” said Mack. Total EPE is essentially the difference between what engineers intended to print on the wafer and the actual features that are fabricated. In order of importance these include four components — CD uniformity stochastics (line-width and line-edge roughness) OPC CD errors and global CD uniformity errors.

“The largest source of EPE is from stochastics so more emphasis is being placed on reducing overlay errors because stochastics are so difficult to control” Mack said. “In fact stochastics are expected to account for 50% of EPEs at 3nm. So what does all this mean for overlay control? Fabs still need to build devices with small edge placement error. But now they have less than half the budget for CD uniformity and overlay. So the requirements on overlay and CD uniformity are shrinking even faster than before.”

Others point to similar issues. “With continued shrinking of EPE budgets for the 5nm node overlay elements of the EPE budget shrink the fastest with higher within-field variation” said Andrew Cross director of Process Control Solutions at KLA.

This leads to higher optical overlay sampling improved overlay measurement techniques and introduction of SEM-based overlay measurements at AEI and ADI. Optical metrology tools use wavelengths in the 500 to 650nm range which is optimal for many process layers and conditions but now long-wavelength (900nm) lasers can image through opaque hard masks especially used in NAND but also DRAM for particular layers. The result is more flexible metrology systems to meet the greatest number of needs.

Overlay measurement calibration

Pattern placement is first checked after the photoresist is developed and if overlay is unacceptable the wafer(s) can be reworked. In high-volume manufacturing fabs may monitor CD uniformity and overlay on select (6) wafers per lot and every lot or perhaps every other lot. ASML’s approach to overlay monitoring includes compiling and crunching great volumes of data.

ASML’s Mulkens explains the components that go into overlay. “Customers take the diffraction measurements from the target in the scribe line. Then of course we need to know how that measured overlay on targets compares to the overlay on device. We call that device overlay. Typically the optical targets have a pitch of several hundred nanometers and the devices are in the order of 20 to 30 nanometer pitch. So there is a metrology to device (MTD) offset which customers measure and calibrate. Then of course you’re still not there because there may be very local errors with EUV stochastics. People use e-beam systems to measure these very local errors which may be on the order of several nanometers. With the CD and overlay errors you may end up with 4 to 5nm overlay and placement error in total.”

The SEM captures local stochastics which together with the overlay measurement are used to determine overlay corrections and CD corrections on the scanner.

When it comes to new technology ramps and correlation of optical measurement systems e-beam imaging is widely used. Only e-beam tools can detect the surface characteristics at the angstrom level by detecting signals from backscattered electrons. In production while some manufacturers talk about the need to use more e-beam measurements in-line the slower throughput still restricts tool usage.

Because SEMs are increasing used for CD SEM measurements it begs the question whether CD SEM and local CDU measurements can be combined in one system.

“They tend to have different voltage requirements and other differences so while there may be some cases where overlay and CD SEM can be combined it isn’t typical” said Mack. “[Using physics-based models] we are developing the ability to make both overlay and stochastic measurements like roughness and all the components that lead to an edge placement error simultaneously. We believe that’s the direction the industry is going in given the right algorithms.”

Target modifications

Overlay measurements rely on measurements made on targets — features in the scribe-line or selectively in-device. The targets are film stacks with a grating using looser dimensions than the device itself (hundreds of nanometers) tailored to the layer to capture in-device overlay.

Target designs play a fundamental role in overlay measurement precision and accuracy but are also subject to size restraints in the scribe line. This is causing some movement to smaller more detailed targets (4 to 8µm per side). Traditional targets were bar-in-bar or box-in-box designs 25 x 25µm but a more sensitive version is shown in figure 3.

Shlomit Katz application development team lead at KLA described recent changes in overlay target design such as greater use of Moiré effect targets. Using overlay interference patterns produced by overlaying but slightly offset patterns Moire effect can be displaced rotated or have slightly different pitch creating phase-induced interference. New targets for NAND and DRAM “are proving to be robust to both symmetric and asymmetric process variation improve the contrast through wavelength and also improve the total measurement uncertainty” said Katz.[1]

APC

On-wafer measurements in the scanner before exposure help achieve high-quality exposure but they also can reveal critical information that feeds process control loops. For instance wafer topography maps detect local overlay errors due to focus spots that might be missed by overlay sampling.

ASML and STMicroelectronics recently provided a glimpse of what next-generation overlay control might look like in fabs using overlay-based computational corrections. By combining physical modeling with machine learning they showed that scanner measurements can be used to predict the overlay performance on wafers or lots that are not measured by metrology to detect potential excursions.[2]

“In order to get the accuracy in the scanner we have our inbuilt sensors alignment sensor and the leveling sensor they measure every wafer and they measure the wafer at a very dense level. As a matter of fact this is one of the few data sets the customer may have characterizing high spatial fingerprints for each wafer. So we derive some algorithms and couple these sensors with the measurements outside of the scanner with the overlay equipment. When you do this correctly the customers can minimize the amount of measurements outside the scanner or they may use that data to up-sample the density of measurements outside the scanner” said ASML’s Mulkens.

Density is driving a number of changes. “One of the key trends we’re seeing coupled with the need for higher precision and higher accuracy is greater sampling to capture the fingerprints across the wafer but just as important also to capture the variation between wafer and lots” Mulkens said. “We see that both when we’re measuring ADI with an optical target-based metrology tool and after etch. And then of course with the e-beam tool people are looking at local placement.”

Applied Materials also talks about greater sampling on wafers to improve accuracy and detect across-wafer variation or fingerprints. For instance the company’s e-beam tool is designed to measure edge placement and CDs at multiple levels simultaneously. For a robust process correlation between ADI and AEI is fundamental to overlay process control (see figure 4).

Conclusion

While overlay control for the most advanced devices strives to feed back data to the scanner more quickly to compensate for errors in-line the next generation of tools high-NA EUV will come will its own challenges. It uses an anamorphic lens supporting 8X magnification in one direction 4X in the other. So field size is reduced by half and the results of two masks are stitched together on the wafer.

“With anamorphic optics the 6-inch mask leads to what we call half fields” said Mulkens. “Now when you print critical layers on the high-NA system and less critical layers on the lower NA system you need to be able to match the half fields to the full fields and vice versa. In order to come up with matching algorithms we do non-concentric matching and that will be the big overlay innovation when it comes to high-NA.”

Pleasant businesses provide education and employment,"MT. PLEASANT — Iowa Workforce Development awarded Mt. Pleasant Chamber members Alliant Energy Sinclair Tractors and Jason Smith Plumbing Heating and Cooling funding intended to create or expand Registered Apprenticeship Programs.

The Registered Apprenticeship programs are designed to benefit both employers and apprentices by filling high-demand fields while allowing the next generation to earn while they learn.

“Registered Apprenticeship is an employer-driven model combining on-the-job learning with related classroom instruction and allows the Registered Apprentice to earn a paycheck from Day One” the Iowa Workforce Development (IWD) website states. “Registered Apprenticeship Programs are a proven solution for recruiting training and retaining world-class talent in Iowa.”

Alliant Energy pays full-time wages and benefits to apprenticeship participants while they learn their new job skills.

The programs benefit the state as a whole also.

“Since Iowa is experiencing a talent gap with an aging workforce of highly skilled and experienced workers this program has the ability to attract a new and more diverse talent pool close the gap in workers’ skills and awards an industry credential issued by the Department of Labor upon completion of the program” the IWD website states. “New industries are offering opportunities including: information technology financial services health care transportation energy advanced manufacturing and hospitality. A Registered Apprenticeship is an appropriate option for all job seekers including women minorities youth people with disabilities and veterans.”

According to Sinclair Tractor there is a growing need for agriculture technicians because innovations require a more knowledgeable workforce and the Registered Apprenticeship programs help close the gap.

(WMTV) - The Boys and Girls Club of Dane County (BGCDC) is throwing in additional $250 in gift cards to community members that bring in certain types of guns to a trade-in event the Dane County Sheriff’s Office said.

This is in addition to the $250 being offered by the Dane County Sheriff’s Office and Madison Police Department.

In the buyback held by Dane Co. Sheriff’s Department and Madison Police Department gun owners that bring in the first five assault-style rifles will be given a $250 gift card in addition to the flat rate that is set. The weapon must be a rapid-fire magazine-fed rifle which includes AR-15s event officials said.

“Too often firearms can get into the wrong hands. The Sheriff’s Office is providing this opportunity for citizens to safely turn in unwanted firearms and possibly prevent a tragedy” Sheriff Kalvin Barrett previously wrote about the program.

County supervisors previously approved Saturday Aug. 13 as the tentative date for its ‘Gifts for Guns’ effort. That date is now confirmed and the event is set to take place at the Alliant Energy Center 1919 Alliant Energy Center Way from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

The money Dane Co. officials say is meant to be spent on basic necessities like groceries and gas.

Other than the exclusive offer from BGCDC flat rates are set for how much each type of firearm will be worth. During the event law enforcement will be offering:

Firearm Value Assault Style Rifle $250 Ghost Guns $200 Handguns/Rifles/Shotguns $100 Revolvers $50 BB Guns/Pellet Guns/Facsimile firearms $10-$25

The Sheriff’s Office has highlighted that this is a No Questions Asked program. People trading their guns will not be required to give their names personal information or information about the weapons. There are however guidelines for bringing the guns and no walkups will be allowed.

Rules for bringing guns to buyback:

Firearms must be transported unloaded and inside a trunk or cargo are of your vehicle.

Firearms should be either wrapped cased or boxed.

Magazines and ammunition must be in a separate area of the vehicle (such as the backseat).

Firearms must be in working condition.

The county budgeted $32000 for buying the weapons; however the Sheriff’s Office has been accepting donations to be spent on the program. More information on donating is available via email.

A trio of U-17 Philadelphia Union Academy players have been named to the MLS NEXT All-Star Game presented by Allstate. Following standout performances that resulted in winning the U-17 MLS NEXT Cup forward Marcos Zambrano-Delgado defender Daniel Krueger and goalkeeper Andrew Rick were selected as part of the inaugural roster for the East. The Union along with Inter Miami CF and San Jose Earthquakes  hold the most representation on the roster with three players each.

Zambrano-Delgado 17 was recently awarded the Golden Boot for his impressive performance at the MLS NEXT Cup where he scored seven goals in five games including a hat trick in a 6-1 win over regional rivals Cedar Stars Academy of Monmouth. His brace in the championship game led the Union to a late 3-2 comeback victory to clinch the cup.

Krueger 16 made a strong impact on both ends of the field scoring two goals and holding opponents to a two-goal maximum the entire tournament.

A Pine Bluff police officer was arrested on charges of insurance fraud and has bailed out of the Jefferson County jail according to authorities.

Jefferson County Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Will Jones confirmed Tuesday that charges were filed against Sydney Dowd 27 after prosecutors received a file from investigators with the Arkansas Insurance Department. Dowd is facing one count of insurance fraud and another count of filing a false report with a law enforcement agency both Class D felonies after a flood damaged her Pine Bluff apartment. Each felony carries a sentence of up to six years if she is convicted.

According to an affidavit by investigator James Kulesa on April 9 Dowd's unit at an apartment complex on McConnell Circle sustained damage from a flood that began in another unit. On April 10 the manager reportedly wanted to gain access to Dowd's unit to look for water damage and eventually informed of the damage.

At 12:45 p.m. 40 minutes after being notified Dowd allegedly started a renters insurance policy with Allstate Insurance with personal property limits of $50000. She allegedly filed a claim with Allstate under that policy on April 12 claiming the water damage occurred at 1:30 a.m. April 11. Investigators say she filed a police report claiming water damage that same day.

""A representative took a recorded telephone statement from Dowd on April 13 at which time Dowd again stated that the loss occurred at 1:30 a.m. on Monday April 11"" Kulesa wrote in the affidavit. ""Dowd stated that several items in the apartment were damaged. Dowd gave a false date of loss knowing that damage had occurred to her apartment before she took out her renters policy. The claim was denied and the victim is not owed restitution.""

Prosecuting Attorney Kyle Hunter filed charges against Dowd on July 22 and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest. She was booked into the Dub Brassell Detention Center at 2:24 p.m. Monday and released one minute later on $5000 bail.

Dowd is scheduled to appear in circuit court Sept. 12.

Pine Bluff Police Chief Denise Richardson has yet to decide whether Dowd will be terminated according to a police spokesperson.

What we didn't know until August 9 2022 is that there's a very good chance these commercials were just inspired by all the ways Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale ends up needing surgery.

Good Hands vs. Broken Pinky Fingers

It was announced by the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday that Dennis Duffy sorry I mean Chris Sale would miss the remainder of the 2022 season after the left-hander injured his wrist in a bike accident that would require surgery. But the latest Chris Sale injury is just the tip of the iceberg.

Sale was already on the injured list after suffering a broken left pinky finger on a line drive come-backer during a start at Yankee Stadium. That injury which happened in his second start after being activated from a different IL stint required surgery but the Red Sox were hoping to have their pitcher back by the end of the season.

They didn't have him until July due to the lefty suffering a stress fracture in his eighth rib during the offseason which forced him to miss the start of spring training. He then set back his recovery from that rib cage injury in May with ""non-baseball-related activities.""

RELATED: Did LeBron James Re-Curse the Boston Red Sox?

The Red Sox acquired Sale when he was one of MLB's best pitchers by shipping off prospects Michael Kopech and Yoan Moncada to the American League Central stalwart the Chicago White Sox. This deal gave the Red Sox a solid ace to compete with their divisional rivals in the Tampa Bay Rays Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees. In the 2018 postseason Sale was a workhorse for Alex Cora's rotation as the AL East champions waltzed through the playoffs to a World Series win against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

All of the 2020 regular season and most of last year were spent on the IL for ""The Vulture"" wait I mean ""The Condor"" after having Tommy John surgery (during the middle of the pandemic when it could be argued such a medical procedure wasn't exactly necessary).

At the end of 2021 after finally coming back from the Tommy John surgery he missed the end of the season with COVID-19. All in all Chris Sale has made a grand total of 11 starts since the Red Sox placed him on the IL with shoulder inflammation on September 1 2019. Here's hoping the man has some good insurance. Good hands indeed."

A spokesperson from Google said the outage at its Council Bluffs Iowa data center was unrelated to the recent Google Search and Maps outage that slowed or shut down those services on Monday August 8. The cause of the outage ""was the result of an internal error"" according to Google's spokesperson. Google is currently not sharing details of the size of the outage. However Google Search and Maps downtime was widely reported on the same day Google experienced an electrical incident (what many would call a data center fire data center electrical explosion and/or an arc flare) at one of its Council Bluffs data center buildings.

Google just reportedly suffered an outage due to a fire at one of the company’s key data centers. The fire is now contained but Google’s core offering Search has yet to recover. Indexing search results and sponsor-supported content all remain sluggish and inaccurate as of this publishing.

The cause of the fire: An electrical explosion (specifically an arc flash) occurred as electricians worked on a substation near the data center in Council Bluffs Iowa according to the San Francisco Gate’s website. All three workers were injured and are in critical condition.

What This Means for Your Data Center

Whether you manage on-prem or leverage colocations a data center fire remains a likely risk to the continuity of your digital infrastructure.

We asked experts what can be done to prevent and/or mitigate the effects of a data center fire.

Data center fires aren’t common. The Uptime Institute has 14 reported fires among its membership in the last six years. With 8000 data centers worldwide one might be tempted to dismiss data center fires as a distant threat. Nothing could be further from the truth according to a senior analyst familiar with Google’s data infrastructure.

“This is a wake-up moment for a lot of people who manage data centers” the source said. “Whether you're a tier 2 3 or 4 data center you have to ask yourself ‘How ready am I to mitigate the fire risk that could take out an entire facility?’”

A high-level approach to addressing data center fire mitigation includes:

Reviewing and updating existing fire suppression and mitigation plans

Updating disaster recovery strategies to harden physical site security against fire damage

Asking tough questions of facilities managers and operations managers around data center fire safety

A more granular view provided by Jensen Hughes’ Paul Amico encourages the development of a thorough fire risk assessment (FRA) that spots the portion of your digital infrastructure that contributes to the biggest business risk. These include key ignition sources and the most important areas to protect in the data center. Amico provides a solid calculation structure here.

A Brief History of Data Center Fires

When considering fire-related data center incidents the March 2021 OVH data center fire often comes to mind. A lack of fire extinguishers and electrical cutoff systems allowed a fire to spread across OVH’s SBG2 facility destroying it completely and damaging the facility’s three other buildings. The company’s founder pledged to build a lab for data center fire research and vows to share the findings with the industry.

Data center expert Stacy Black recounted her experience with data center fires and how her firm addressed the aftermath. At AFCOM’s 2022 Data Center World conference Black laid out a nine-point plan for optimal data center fire prevention:

Solid documentation Label all equipment properly Right-size talent: The right people in the right place at the right time to protect your data center Annual fire safety inspections Documented technical hardware refresh cycle Written procedures especially fire suppression Coordinated facility maintenance Risk management and planning Strong IT leadership

Black stated during her session that it’s important to remember money isn’t the only obstacle to protecting data centers from fires. In reference to strong IT leadership she mentioned organizational leadership must own their narrative around fire suppression.

Investors and market watchers noted Amazon’s less-than-stellar forays into health care while privacy advocates raised concerns about Amazon’s access to patient medical data. Still others have voiced hopes Amazon will bring much-needed efficiencies and improved customer experience to health care as it has to retail shopping.

Amitabh Chandra is the Henry and Allison McCance Professor of Business Administration and faculty chair of the M.S./M.B.A. program in life sciences at Harvard Business School. He is also Ethel Zimmerman Wiener Professor of Public Policy and Director of Health Policy Research at Harvard Kennedy School. Chandra spoke to the Gazette about Amazon’s latest gamble and what it may mean for consumers.

Q&A

Amitabh Chandra

GAZETTE: Given the size of its investment what could Amazon’s recent acquisition of One Medical mean for the health care industry?

CHANDRA: Amazon is an enormous company. I think we’re all excited because it’s Amazon but the reality is that it’s a $4 billion expense for a company that has $160 billion dollars of current assets on its balance sheet that they can deploy to buy another company. So this is actually a very small acquisition for Amazon — very very small.

This aside the idea behind the business model of One Medical is twofold: to make health care easier to access and through prevention and better primary care management to avert downstream spending. These are laudable goals. But One Medical certainly has not figured out how to save money. They’ve been hemorrhaging money and they have extremely low margins in part because most of health care spending is on sick patients and can’t be easily reduced. Amazon has bought into One Medical’s aspiration which again is wonderful if they succeed. But from the perspective of an Amazon shareholder or the hard-nosed evidence to date it is probably going to cause that shareholder to lose the money that One Medical shareholders were losing.

“Shopping for health care is nothing like shopping for the other items that Amazon might be selling …”

GAZETTE: Why do you think Amazon decided to plunge further into health care an area they haven’t had a lot of success in?

CHANDRA: When Amazon looks at health care they probably see two opportunities where they could add a lot of value. First the supply chain in health care is a mess. There are so many intermediaries selling to other people and Amazon has done extremely well by streamlining the supply chain. So they must be thinking that the current insurers and other payers can’t improve the supply chain relative to what they can.

The second area where Amazon may think it can help is on price transparency: Prices are often opaque in health care. Nobody really knows the price of anything. But it’s a leap to think that by making the prices more transparent we can save money in health care. There have been countless experiments around price transparency in health care where patients have been given information on prices and there’s no evidence they use that information at the time they need their health care. Shopping for health care is nothing like shopping for the other items that Amazon might be selling and these kinds of ideas involving more consumerism in health care have not worked — and it’s not like other companies have not tried.

More generally Amazon has been interested in health care for over 20 years but their performance is somewhere between a C and C+. They’ve been trying to run Amazon Care just before the pandemic to offer health care to its employees. The take up of that has been poor. Before the pandemic they bought PillPack for something like $800 million. It’s not clear that PillPack has been able to displace any of the large pharmacies. They had a disaster in 2018 when they launched Haven along with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway which was a naive effort to reform health care. Haven folded in 2021. And in the late 1990s they tried to buy drugstore.com. So they’ve been interested in health care for a very long time but unsuccessful. Health care is hard and general lessons from outside health care don’t always apply to health care.

GAZETTE: What does Amazon’s entry into primary care mean potentially for consumer access to health care? Amazon is a trusted well-known brand so the company could easily attract more customers. But it also has a reputation for crowding out competitors once they get a foothold in a marketplace which could potentially lead to limited choice and less access for consumers.

CHANDRA: I’m not that worried about them crowding out competitors just yet. Maybe they’ll do that if they’re incredibly successful but my point is they’re not going to be incredibly successful. But if they are then that’s a conversation that the regulators need to be aware of.

In the short run my great worry is patient privacy. They’re going to get something like 10 or 15 years of patient data from One Medical. What are they going to use that for? How are they going to use it? What safeguards will patients in this new Amazon/One Medical health care have on how their data will be used? I would like regulators to think about and wrestle with that issue.

The other worry for regulators is that Amazon may bungle One Medical because it doesn’t know how to run a health care business — which is not only a logistics business. There isn’t much that one can do about this but it would be sad if One Medical would have been more successful if owned by say United or CVS or Walgreens or Humana than if owned by Amazon.

“Amazon is good at selling other people’s products — but I don’t see it as a pharmaceutical company that might cure disease.”

GAZETTE: Amazon is highly customer-driven and known for finding ways to streamline its operations to provide greater efficiencies and save the company money. That can result in faster more convenient service for customers. Getting medical care is anything but convenient or efficient. How might Amazon make the customer experience more important in the business of delivering services?

CHANDRA: I like the fact that Amazon might be able to improve the customer experience in health care because people are clearly frustrated by that. But despite the general frustration improving the patient experience is not going to save money on health care. Improving the experience makes it easier to access health care and that increases spending. Second most of the spending in health care happens at the end of life or on very sick patients. So improving the efficiency of primary care scheduling or vaccine appointments or something like that — that’s not going to be a very big market. Other companies like Teladoc Health have captured much more of the “patient experience” market than One Medical has. There’s already a bunch of other well-established public companies that have figured out that what you don’t want is a brick-and-mortar facility. What you want is more of a virtual relationship with your doctor. And so if that’s really the future then buying a bunch of brick-and-mortar facilities at a 77 percent premium was exactly the wrong answer.

GAZETTE: Has the public’s newfound acceptance of telehealth shifted the way providers view delivery of service?

CHANDRA: We’d already started to see a move toward telehealth before the pandemic. Two and a half years of COVID accelerated that movement and it’s here to stay. But to be clear: These telehealth visits improve the patient experience. They don’t save money in general. First it’s easier for patients to schedule a visit so more visits get scheduled. And second almost all of the spending in health care is on very sick patients. That’s not where the One Medical model acts and that’s not where the telehealth model is. So telehealth doesn’t become a way to bend the cost curve as much as a way to make health care easier to access.

There’s this aspiration in health care that if we only got people more primary care and took care of things earlier we would be spending less on most of their conditions. That’s certainly possible but we’ve never figured out how to deliver this aspiration in a systematic manner. The aspiration might even be possible — like putting a human on Mars — but that’s quite different than thinking that we know how to land a human on Mars. The sobering reality of health care is that terrible things — Alzheimer’s or cancer or an accident — can happen to anyone including very healthy people. And that’s the bulk of health care spending. The reason that health insurance is expensive is not the lack of primary care. It’s all the other expensive stuff that we need when we’re really sick. And Amazon is no expert in managing any of that.

GAZETTE: It seems that Amazon has a shot at improving the business of health care but is that the same as really fundamentally changing the field?

CHANDRA: If you ask me what the biggest challenges in American health care are today I would say that U.S. health care is really expensive and that we desperately need more meaningful innovation for a whole host of diseases — diabetes cardiovascular disease Parkinson’s Alzheimer’s and ALS. We want cures not chronic disease management.

How does Amazon’s foray into health care help with either? Simply because Amazon might be able to introduce supply-chain disruptions that increase its profit margin does not mean that patients will benefit from Amazon’s greater profitability. Amazon might continue to charge the high prices but pocket the savings.

It’s also not clear how Amazon will lower deductibles co-payments and co-insurance. But we need to do these [things] because we know patients respond to these financial barriers by cutting back on valuable care. Amazon’s not going to fix that problem.

Amazon is good at selling other people’s products — but I don’t see it as a pharmaceutical company that might cure disease.

Also Amazon also paid 77 percent more than the market value of One Medical. CVS looked at One Medical and passed on acquiring it. CVS is a lot more knowledgeable about health care including the supply chain than Amazon is. So what does Amazon see in One Medical that CVS does not?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vY29udGVudC9vbmxpbmUtc2hvcHBlcnMtc2VhcmNoLW9uLWFtYXpvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoppers start their product search on Amazon,Our research focuses on the five core coverage areas below.

It’s available now mostly pitched to back-to-school shopping but many remember layaway generally as a department store holiday staple in the decades following World War II. The idea was – and is – this: You’d reserve big purchases like Christmas toys for the kids well ahead of the big day and pay the store’s layaway department a portion of the final tab every few weeks until the item was paid for and ready to be retrieved wrapped and delivered to eager children or other recipients.

Amazon Layaway works virtually in a similar fashion. Curiously it’s the inverse of the intensely popular (and significantly more risky) buy now pay later programs. Here you pay now get later.

Amazon says it has thousands of selected items ready for Amazon Layaway and there’s no credit check no interest charged and there are no cancellation fees. Items are clearly marked with a button that says “Reserve with Layaway.” Layaway customers pay 20% of the item’s total cost at initial checkout. The item is then reserved and the price is locked in.

Next steps include making equal payments every two weeks for up to eight weeks until the item or items are paid in full. A quicker payoff means a faster delivery. Not every item Amazon sells is available for layaway. Amazon advises if you want the items to arrive in time for December holidays to make your purchases by Oct. 23.

But is layaway a sound money-saving move?

Unlike buying via a credit card layaway programs typically don’t charge interest – though some stores in the past charged small “layaway fees” to store the items – and aren’t considered a form of debt (thus no need for a credit check).

Amazon isn’t charging any fees above the costs of the items but should other retailers resuscitate layaway consider whether they charge layaway fees (a decade ago Best Buy charged 5% of the total layaway price and retailers including Burlington Coat Factory Marshalls and T.J. Maxx charged a $5 non refundable layaway fee).

For context always refer to the full article.

The settlement allows the Filipino-owned Asiaticus Management Corporation to pursue a $2-billion mining project in Davao Oriental alone or with a new foreign partner

DAVAO ORIENTAL Philippines – Australia’s BHP Group Limited one of the world’s biggest mining companies and its counterpart in Davao Oriental Asiaticus Management Corporation (AMCOR) ended their protracted legal battle in the Philippines and abroad with a multimillion-dollar settlement.

The settlement would allow AMCOR to pursue a $2-billion mining project in Davao Oriental province alone or with a new foreign partner.

The two companies found themselves going to the courts in the Philippines and Singapore more than a decade ago after AMCOR canceled its joint venture contract with the mining giant for the Pujada Bay mining project in Mati City in Davao Oriental in 2007.

Formerly known as BHP Billiton the Melbourne-based mining company was the world’s biggest in 2017 while AMCOR is a consortium of the Austral-Asi Link Mining Corporation and Hallmark Mining Corporation. AMCOR holds the right over a 17000-hectare mining concession area in Davao Oriental.

AMCOR’s concession area covers areas within the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary the first and only UNESCO-declared World Heritage Site in Mindanao and parts of the Pujada Bay Seascape and Landscape which has been declared as among the world’s most beautiful bays.

“The legal battle between AMCOR and our foreign partner BHP Billiton is over” Dr. Arvin Carlom AMCOR manager said over the weekend.

Carlom said the settlement cost AMCOR $20 million to refund BHP for its investment in the Davao Oriental mining project.

The settlement came after opposite rulings on the case by courts in the Philippines and Singapore.

The Singapore International Arbitration Centre a United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of BHP’s case against AMCOR’s arbitrary cancellation of its contract with the mining giant on July 25 2007.

AMCOR’s act had resulted in the freezing of the Pujada nickel project in Mati the capital of Davao Oriental.

AMCOR however secured a favorable ruling from a Philippine court about the same case that reached the Court of Appeal (CA).

“With the two different rulings the two mining companies just agreed to an amicable settlement. The $20 million was a refund for the investment of BHP Billiton. Now we (AMCOR) are operating on our own” said Carlom.

But Carlom said AMCOR has started negotiations for a possible partnership with Japanese and Chinese groups that were interested in nickel extraction because of high demands in Japan and China.

“When it comes to nickel processing the Philippines does not have the technology yet. The technologies are not owned by Filipinos. So to put up a nickel processing plant we need to have partners. That is why we are now talking to prospective foreign partners” he said.

But just as AMCOR made its presence felt in Davao Oriental again environmental activists and local Catholic leaders have mobilized and warned of mass actions to pressure the government into stopping the mining company from resuming and expanding its operations.

The Catholic Diocese of Mati has started a signature campaign against mining activities in the province.

Carlom however said those opposed to AMCOR’s operations need not worry because the firm’s mining activities were 5.8 kilometers from a buffer zone of Mount Hamuiguitan.

He also said AMCOR’s operations would be confined to 10000 of its 17000-hectare concession area at Mount Hamiguitan “because we value that jewel.” – Rappler.com",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jefferson City Mo. — Ameren Missouri recently filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission to adjust its electric base rates next year.

The new rates would take effect in mid-2023 to recover the cost of major upgrades for electric system reliability and resiliency for customers according to a press release. The new rates would also go towards investments to support the transition to cleaner energy for the benefit of customers and local communities.

“The electric system upgrades Ameren Missouri has made are crucial to ensuring our customers have safe and reliable energy during the continued transition to cleaner sources of generation” Mark Birk chairman and president of Ameren Missouri said. “Our customers depend on us to deliver reliable service and they’re seeing fewer outages with shorter durations delivering up to a 40% improvement in reliability on circuits with innovative technology.”

The filing made Wednesday will be reviewed by the commission and many other stakeholders over the next 11 months. If the request is approved by regulators the rate adjustment in 2023 would cost the average residential electric customer an additional $12 a month (based on approximately 1017 kilowatt-hours of usage per month).

Ameren Missouri’s electric rates today are higher than they were five years ago. This rate adjustment request if approved would reflect an average yearly increase of approximately 2.3% since 2017.

Residential rates for Ameren Missouri customers are more than 23% below national and Midwest averages according to the latest Edison Electric Institute Typical Bills and Average Rates Report.

“Our goal is to keep rates as low as possible while protecting long-term energy reliability and resiliency for our customers” Warren Wood vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs at Ameren Missouri said. “We do this by focusing on necessary and prudent system investments our customers depend on while also reducing our operational costs wherever possible in these uncertain economic times.”

Key components of the rate review adjustment request include:

Strengthening the grid through Ameren Missouri’s Smart Energy Plan  including infrastructure upgrades bolstering reliability and resiliency more renewable generation installation of smart meters and the addition of programs to stimulate economic growth for communities across the state.

 including infrastructure upgrades bolstering reliability and resiliency more renewable generation installation of smart meters and the addition of programs to stimulate economic growth for communities across the state.

Evolving generation plans for cleaner energy and to ensure the system remains reliable and resilient for all customers.

Providing cleaner energy to the communities served through the Neighborhood Solar program by installing parking lot solar facilities in partnership with local organizations.

“We want our customers to know we are here to help them” Birk said. “Any customers in need of assistance should contact us today for information regarding access to energy assistance grants with expanded eligibility requirements and to arrange flexible payment options. We also have energy efficiency programs and energy management tools to make it easier for customers to manage their energy use.”

Julie Sloat currently AEP’s executive vice president and chief financial officer became president on Wednesday and she will transition to CEO on Jan. 1.

She replaces Nick Akins 61 who is stepping down as president immediately as part of the company's succession plan and will end his term as CEO Dec. 31. He will remain chairman of the company's board.

He has been president and CEO since 2011 and chairman since 2014.

Sloat 53 has been executive vice president and chief financial officer for AEP since January 2021 and was a former president and chief operating officer of AEP Ohio an AEP operating company that serves 1.5 million customers in the state.

She is AEP's 11 president and seventh CEO and the first woman to run the company.

""This is a time of tremendous change and opportunity for AEP as we invest in new energy technologies and infrastructure to provide clean and reliable energy to our 5.5 million customers” Sloat said in a statement. “I’m honored to have the opportunity to lead an amazing team of nearly 17000 employees and have seen first-hand their commitment to the communities we serve and ensuring our customers can count on us every day to power their lives and businesses. It’s an exciting time to be in this industry and build on the 116-year legacy of AEP.”

Sloat takes over at a time when the company is transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The company has pledged to slash its emissions of carbon dioxide by 80% by 2030 and net zero by 2050.

The move comes weeks after AEP Ohio was widely criticized for intentionally turning off power to some Columbus neighborhoods to keep power outages from spreading.

The decision followed severe storms that did extensive damage to AEP's transmission system and hot weather that sent demand for electricity soaring. AEP Ohio has defended its actions saying it had just a few minutes to act and that it was ordered to curtail power consumption by the agency that oversees the power grid to the region.

“Julie is an exceptional leader who has successfully led key strategic areas for the company” Akins said in a statement. “Her financial expertise and positive relationship with investors have been essential for the execution of our long-term strategy enabling us to deliver strong earnings quarter after quarter while continuing to raise guidance and provide consistent dividend growth.""

Stepping into the president’s role today and the CEO seat Jan. 1 is Julie Sloat who has overseen AEP’s finances since January of last year and before that was senior vice president of treasury and risk for two years and president and CEO of AEP Ohio for nearly three years.

Last week U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) Chair of the Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation and U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works introduced the Grant to Rapidly Invest and Deploy Broadband or GRID Broadband Act a pioneering proposal that would provide a robust new federal cost-share to spur investment in a nationwide middle-mile backbone along the nation’s existing electricity grid. The goal of this bipartisan initiative is to help provide affordable high-speed Internet options to the 120 million American households that lack connectivity and enhance the resiliency diversity and security of America’s electrical grid.

“Building out fiber along our nation’s existing grid will provide the communications capacity needed to modernize our energy system make our grid more cybersecure and bring affordable high-speed internet to tens of millions of hard-to-reach households” said Senator Cantwell. “It’s a triple win solution for consumers because it leverages existing rights-of-way and private sector ingenuity and investment to deliver cleaner electricity stronger cybersecurity and more accessible broadband services. Almost a century ago the Rural Electrification Act helped bring power and productivity to every American home and business now we can piggyback on that success by using the same network to also deliver the data and information America needs to prosper in this century.”

“In order to accomplish our goal of bringing reliable high-speed internet access to every West Virginia community we need to continue bringing solutions to the table” said Senator Capito. “The GRID Broadband Act would utilize our nation’s electric grid system to help build out and deploy broadband especially in some of the most rural areas of West Virginia with little to no service. Closing the digital divide is a bipartisan priority and I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Cantwell.”

Internet access has become essential to participating in today’s digital world—it’s the place we go to work attend school visit the doctor and do many other things in our everyday lives. Unfortunately broadband remains unavailable or too expensive for people to adopt across the country. Data provided by Microsoft shows that approximately 120 million Americans do not access the affordable high-speed internet they need to participate in remote work and education telehealth and ecommerce. According to a Pew Research study 45% of Americans without broadband access cited price among the reasons they did not have broadband service.

In many of these same places where broadband remains out of reach for consumers utilities are upgrading their infrastructure to make their networks more cybersecure and intelligent through “smart grid” technologies. With the right policies in place this investment could also be used to provide resilient and broadband networks to help push deployment in unserved and underserved areas. In one case study from Elko Nevada additional middle-mile capacity has resulted in prices declining by as much as six times.



Middle-mile infrastructure connects network hubs with the retail networks (known as last-mile infrastructure) that directly serve homes and businesses. These are critical links because last-mile broadband speed and reliability is dependent on the middle-mile infrastructure that serves it. Middle-mile infrastructure connects network hubs with the retail networks (known as last-mile infrastructure) that directly serve homes and businesses. These are critical links because last-mile broadband speed and reliability is dependent on the middle-mile infrastructure that serves it.

Accordingly the GRID Broadband Act seeks to leverage these investments to create a triple win that will:

Enable more diverse and distributed energy sources to connect to the grid Facilitate more cyber-secure communications capacity and Provide ubiquitous middle-mile capacity to drive down broadband costs nationwide and provide new options for underserved communities.

This investment will create thousands of skilled jobs while enhancing the capacity and resilience of our critical networks reducing costs to providers and consumers and setting the stage for sustained long-term economic growth.

Under the GRID Broadband Act the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration is charged with issuing competitive cost-shared federal grants to encourage the rapid development of a secure nationwide broadband backbone on existing electric grid infrastructure. Recipients of GRID Broadband awards must use the funding to improve cybersecurity and smart grid technology on their electrical grid infrastructure as well as increase middle-mile broadband capacity. Grant recipients must cover at least half of project costs except for a qualifying not-for-profit utility or Native entity that is providing access to underserved or unserved communities.

The GRID Broadband Act is supported by a broad coalition of public and private utilities and public interest groups.

“Edison Electric Institute commends Senators Cantwell and Capito for prioritizing fiber investments that will help close the digital divide ultimately benefiting all Americans. The GRID Broadband Act will provide resources to help accelerate the deployment of fiber that will provide additional flexibility to grid operators in the event of extreme weather. It will also improve cybersecurity and resilience and will help with the further integration of renewable and energy storage technologies. Additionally these fiber investments will significantly boost opportunities for electric companies to build out middle-mile broadband infrastructure creating jobs and connecting underserved and unserved customers.” – Tom Kuhn President Edison Electric Institute

“Building out middle-mile broadband infrastructure is a critical step that will serve two important purposes: enhancing the resiliency of the electric grid and connecting rural communities to high-speed internet service. These efforts are crucially important as the American economy increasingly relies on electricity and web-based businesses to fuel the future. We thank the committee for spotlighting these important issues.” – Louis Finkel Senior Vice President National Rural Electric Cooperative Association

“I commend Senator Maria Cantwell chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation (Commerce Committee) for her leadership in introducing the Grants to Rapidly Invest and Deploy Broadband Act of 2022 (GRID Broadband Act of 2022). This legislation will be the catalyst for urgently needed middle mile deployment by electric utilities. I applaud the ambitious goals defined in the GRID Broadband Act of 2022 as it will provide resilient and redundant middle mile fiber optic infrastructure enhance the resilience reliability and security of the electric grid and reduce the cost of high-speed broadband across the United States. By funding utility fiber deployment the GRID Broadband Act will support utility operations and promote broadband access which will stimulate new economic growth opportunities for unserved and underserved communities. UTC supports Senator Cantwell for her unwavering support of and direction on this crucial issue. I believe that this legislation will facilitate the high-capacity infrastructure required to support robust sustainable and affordable connectivity for grid modernization and zero carbon initiatives broadband access as well as 5G/6G backhaul. UTC is looking forward to working collaboratively and constructively with Senator Cantwell and the members of the Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle.” – Sheryl Osiene-Riggs President and CEO Utilities Technology Council

“Middle mile connections are the backbone of the internet because they not only enable connections to households and businesses but also can promote reliability and help make broadband more affordable. Unfortunately many communities lack middle mile connections. We appreciate Senator Cantwell’s leadership to bring these connections to the rural Tribal and low-income communities that need them.” – Jenna Leventoff Senior Policy Counsel Public Knowledge

“WISPA – Broadband Without Boundaries thanks Chairwoman Cantwell and Senator Capito for recognizing the important role small fixed wireless providers play in closing the digital divide and for working with us to ensure our members can gain access to the middle mile infrastructure this legislation authorizes. WISPA’s members are connectivity first responders and this legislation gives them additional tools to get the job done.” – David Zumwalt President and CEO WISPA Wireless Internet Service Providers Association - Broadband Without Boundaries

“The Washington Public Utility Districts Association supports this novel effort as a mechanism to bring connectivity technologies to our state and around the nation. Connectivity is a key driver in our efforts to bring sustainable reliable and affordable energy to our communities in addition to allowing access to the internet to our unserved and underserved communities. We want to thank Senator Cantwell for her continuing efforts and look forward to providing our support.” – George Caan Executive Director Washington PUD Association.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5yZWwuZ292L25ld3MvcHJvZ3JhbS8yMDIyL2Fzc2Vzc2luZy1wb3dlci1zeXN0ZW0tcmVsaWFiaWxpdHktaW4tYS1jaGFuZ2luZy1ncmlkLWVudmlyb25tZW50Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Assessing Power System Reliability in a Changing Grid Environment,"Assessing Power System Reliability in a Changing Grid Environment

NREL's Energy Analysts Use the ""Three Rs"" Concept To Provide a Fuller Picture of Power System Reliability With Changing Resource Mixes Grid Conditions

How the grid is planned is changing due to many factors including increasing effects from climate change like wildfires. Photo from iStock

From increasing decarbonization electrification and distributed generation to more frequent extreme weather events from climate change the electric power system is undergoing immense change. These factors impact how the grid is planned and operated to maintain safe and reliable power.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation—which is dedicated to monitoring the overall health of the bulk power system and minimizing reliability and security risks—published the 2022 Summer Reliability Assessment. The report identified several areas that are at higher risk this summer due to extreme drought conditions transmission lines out of service higher demand and more. Heightened reliability risks make power system planning even more important.

To frame the issue of reliability researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) use the ""three Rs of power system reliability"": resource adequacy operational reliability and resilience. All three Rs are required for a safe and reliable power system. This concept has guided recent NREL studies on maintaining reliability with a changing grid and environment.

There is no single absolute definition for each of the three Rs and some aspects overlap. In addition the metrics used to measure power system reliability are still being developed and are currently an important conversation within the grid planning space. However the three Rs can inform holistic power system planning and operation to ensure a safe and reliable grid.

""Every region is different and requires its own unique analysis but the three Rs can help to provide a more comprehensive picture of power system reliability and risk to grid planners regulators and policymakers"" said Paul Denholm principal energy analyst at NREL. ""The three Rs can also guide the evolution of power system reliability metrics moving forward.""

Resource Adequacy: Sufficient Spare Capacity

Resource adequacy is the ability of the power system to supply enough electricity—at the right locations—to keep the lights on even during extreme weather days or times when load drops. Resource adequacy is typically measured by the probability of an outage over an extended amount of time. When evaluating resource adequacy NREL broadly considers uncertainty in both supply and demand.

Load uncertainty includes increasing electric demand stressful load periods and more. Supply uncertainty includes the occasional but expected common outages in power plants transmission and distribution lines and other grid equipment. Supply uncertainty also includes the availability of variable resources like solar and wind as well as energy storage and demand response particularly during times of system stress.

An adequate system has enough available resources (e.g. spare capacity and/or flexible load) to replace capacity that fails is out of service for maintenance or is unavailable due to fuel constraints. The transmission system is also important to ensuring resource adequacy because it delivers generation from many resources to load sites and enables access to a greater diversity of variable renewable resources and load across neighboring regions.

With more renewables being added to the grid resource adequacy must increasingly account for the variability of renewable energy supply role of storage changes in demand patterns and impact of transmission outages and interregional coordination.

Operational Reliability: Ability To Respond in Real Time

Operational reliability is the ability of the power system to balance supply and demand in real time by managing variability ramping constraints and flexible loads—including immediately following an ""event"" like a large power plant or transmission line failure. A reliable power system can keep the lights on during these unexpected events with power plants that can rapidly vary output or end users that can reduce their electricity consumption.

One aspect of operational reliability is operating reserves or available spare capacity that actively responds during an event to help balance power and maintain stable frequency. For example inertia on the grid allows time for the mechanical systems that control most power plants to detect and respond to a failure.

Grid services like inertia have traditionally been provided by conventional fossil nuclear or hydroelectric plants that use spinning synchronous generators. However wind solar photovoltaics and batteries are inverter-based resources meaning they rely on power electronics or inverters to generate grid-compatible electricity.

""As more conventional generators are replaced with inverter-based resources it's important to understand how they can maintain a safe and stable grid"" said Mohit Joshi NREL grid analyst who supports developing countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia with their long-term power system planning.

Resilience: Ability To Bounce Back

Resilience is not as clearly defined as resource adequacy or operational reliability. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission defines it as ""the ability to withstand and reduce the magnitude and/or duration of disruptive events which includes the capability to anticipate absorb adapt to and/or rapidly recover from such an event.""

Parts of resilience overlap with resource adequacy and operational reliability but generally it captures how well a system recovers or how quickly power can be restored after an outage. Resilience also includes more extreme events than the typical outages considered with resource adequacy and operational reliability.

""Over the years with increasing renewable generation electric vehicles demand response and other emerging technologies we have learned that there doesn't have to be a tradeoff between decarbonization and power system reliability"" Joshi said. ""About a decade ago there was skepticism in South Asian and Southeast Asian countries whether the power system could operate with wind and solar but in some grids we have seen instantaneous contributions of variable generation up to 100%. Moving forward there will be new technologies and there may be new challenges but through our research we can find solutions to continue to ensure a low-carbon safe and reliable grid.""

These can be a great way to add extra points and miles to your balances. If a bank wants to keep you as a customer then you may receive a retention offer in the form of points miles or cash.

I recently used the chat function on the American Express website for retention offers on three cards and came away with 85000 points plus $150 in statement credits. That represents $1850 in value to me which was definitely worth five minutes of my time. Here's a look at my experience with tips on how you can replicate it.

Why you should use the online chat function for retention offers

Much of the discussion on retention offers focuses on calling to ask for a retention offer. However now that American Express and Citi have online chat functions I prefer using these.

During these discussions you will often receive some terms and conditions from the bank and I like seeing these rather than having them read to me over the phone.

Additionally if you receive an offer from the bank having it in writing (and then grabbing a screenshot to save for your records) is ideal.

Finally if you get nervous on the phone this can be a way to reduce your anxiety. And it gives you more time to digest whether you think a retention offer is worth it without being put on the spot on the phone.

My personal experience with online retention offers

The annual fee on three of my Amex cards posted recently. I used the chat function to inquire about retention offers on all three. The chats were pretty quick with a total combined time of five minutes.

1st offer: The Platinum Card® from American Express

As you may know the Amex Platinum card has one of the highest annual fees out there. When the $695 annual fee posted (see rates and fees) I wanted to make sure I made it worth my while.

On this card I received an offer of 55000 Membership Rewards points for spending $4000 in the next three months. TPG values these points at $1100 which is a 27.5% return on the spending required. I accepted this offer gladly.

2nd offer: American Express Platinum Card® for Schwab

You must be a Schwab banking customer to apply for this card — which you should be since it's one of the best bank accounts for travelers. You can read more about the different types of Platinum Cards here.

A unique feature of the Platinum Card for Schwab is that you can transfer points directly to your bank account cashing them out at a rate of 1.1 cents apiece. While this isn't the best value for your Amex points it does provide extra options for using your points when you have to pay cash for something and want to reimburse yourself for the purchase.

On this card the Amex chat agent offered me a $150 statement credit to offset part of the annual fee. There was no spending required to receive this credit and it posted to my account within 48 hours. I happily took it.

The information for the Amex Platinum Card for Schwab has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

3rd offer: American Express® Gold Card

The chat representative offered 30000 bonus points if I would spend $3000 on my Gold Card in the next three months. According to TPG's valuations this is a 20% return on spending.

Adding up my offers

In total I received offers for 85000 Membership Rewards points plus a $150 statement credit with a spending requirement of $7000. This amounts to another welcome offer in my eyes but it doesn't require an application for a new card a hard pull on my credit or new accounts showing up on my credit report. Those are all positives. TPG's valuations put my offers at $1850 in value — definitely worth a few minutes of my time.

Bottom line

Without a doubt sign-up bonuses from credit cards are the best way to earn a huge stash of points and miles that you can use for travel. However you can also use authorized user bonuses referral bonuses and retention offers to pad your balances.

I'm a big fan of using chat functions for retention offers whenever possible. My Amex chat retention offers took about five minutes of my time but provided $1850 in value.

I don't think you have any doubts about whether I'm happy with the results. Hopefully this avenue can work for you too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NvcmVpbmNhcnRlci8yMDIyLzA4LzA5L2lzc2EtcmFlLWhlYWRsaW5lcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLWxpdmUtMjAyMi1pbi1uZXcteW9yay1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Issa Rae Headlines American Express' Business Class LIVE 2022 In New York City,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/coreincarter/2022/08/09/issa-rae-headlines-american-express-business-class-live-2022-in-new-york-city/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NvcmVpbmNhcnRlci8yMDIyLzA4LzA5L2lzc2EtcmFlLWhlYWRsaW5lcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLWxpdmUtMjAyMi1pbi1uZXcteW9yay1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vd25lcnNoaXAtc3RydWN0dXJlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtY29tcGFueS0xMDEzNTkxMDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is The Ownership Structure Like For American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)?,"Every investor in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger smaller companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

With a market capitalization of US$118b American Express is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about American Express.

Check out our latest analysis for American Express

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Express. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see American Express' historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. In comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.2% and 5.9% of the stock.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting too.

Insider Ownership Of American Express

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Story continues

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Express Company in their own names. Being so large we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively they own US$135m of stock. In this sort of situation it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 13% ownership the general public mostly comprising of individual investors have some degree of sway over American Express. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Public Company Ownership

It appears to us that public companies own 20% of American Express. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar or work together.

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - American Express has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

$200 Hotel Credit: Basic Card Members on U.S. Consumer Platinum Card Account are eligible to receive up to $200 in statement credits per calendar year when they or Additional Platinum Card Members use their Cards to pay for eligible prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts® and The Hotel Collection bookings made through American Express Travel (meaning through amextravel.com the Amex® App or by calling the phone number on the back of your eligible Card) or when Companion Platinum Card Members on such Platinum Card Accounts pay for eligible prepaid bookings for The Hotel Collection made through American Express Travel (meaning through amextravel.com the Amex® App or by calling the phone number on the back of your eligible Card). Please note access to the benefit may take up to 24 hours to take effect on your Card after Account opening. Purchases by both the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on the Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However the total amount of statement credits for eligible purchases will not exceed $200 per calendar year per Card Account. Fine Hotels + Resorts® program bookings may be made only by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic Platinum and Additional Platinum Card Members. The Hotel Collection bookings may be made by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic and Additional Platinum Card Members and Companion Platinum Card Members on the Platinum Card Account. Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Card Members are not eligible for the benefit. To receive the statement credits an eligible Card Member must make a new booking using their eligible Card through American Express Travel on or after July 1st 2021 that is prepaid (referred to as ""Pay Now"" on amextravel.com and the Amex App) for a qualifying stay at an available participating Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection property. Bookings of The Hotel Collection require a minimum stay of two consecutive nights. Eligible bookings must be processed before December 31st 11:59PM Central Time each calendar year to be eligible for statement credits within that year. Eligible bookings do not include interest charges cancellation fees property fees or other similar fees or any charges by a property to you (whether for your booking your stay or otherwise).

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance. Please refer to AmericanExpress.com/FHR and AmericanExpress.com/HC for more information about Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection respectively.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. AIG had an excellent quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic financial and operational objectives. I could not be more pleased with the exceptional results in general insurance. And life and retirement again delivered good results despite very challenging equity market conditions significant volatility and other headwinds.

As you saw in our press release adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $1.19. General insurance achieved a calendar year combined ratio of 87.4% the first sub-90 quarter and best result this business has achieved in over 15 years. The accident year combined ratio excluding CATs was 88.5% a 260 basis point improvement year over year and the 16th consecutive quarter of improvement. And the accident year combined ratio excluding CATs in global commercial was 85.3% an improvement of 400 basis points year over year.

Consistent with our strategy to manage volatility catastrophe losses were very modest in the quarter coming in at $121 million or 1.8% of a combined ratio. Life and retirement has strong fixed annuity sales with over $1.3 billion in deposits for the second straight quarter which benefited from the origination capabilities of Blackstone. AIG returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases and $256 million of dividends. In addition we are on track to buy back at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter.

We ended the second quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity which Shane will go through in more detail in his remarks. On today's call I will provide more detail on five topics. First I will provide an update on the IPO of our life and retirement business which will be known as Corebridge Financial once the company is public and discuss why we chose not to proceed with the IPO in the second quarter. I will also review the significant progress we've continued to make on various aspects of the separation of Corebridge as we prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company.

Second as a follow-on to the IPO discussion I will review life and retirement results where as I mentioned the core business showed continued resilience and solid performance despite headwinds largely driven from a reduction in net investment income. Third I will review the performance of general insurance where underwriting excellence continues to produce outstanding results with strong profitability and top-line growth particularly in our global commercial portfolio. Fourth I will provide an update on AIG 200 where we achieved critical milestones and delivered on our stated goal of $1 billion in exit run rate savings six months ahead of schedule. Lastly I'll provide an update on capital management particularly with respect to stock buybacks and debt reduction.

Following my remarks Shane will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call. As you can see our team has accomplished a lot on many fronts. Before expanding on our financial and operating performance I want to address the status of the Corebridge IPO.

Our base case had always been to complete the IPO in the second quarter subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. In deciding whether to launch the initial public offering in May or June we weighed several variables which were all market-related some specific to Corebridge and some more macro level. These included equity market conditions and particularly the trading values of companies in the life and retirement sector that we consider to be the most comparable to Corebridge. In the second quarter equity markets were down 16% with only three weeks seeing positive market returns the VIX which was above 30 resulting in extremely elevated market volatility and feedback we received from advisors analysts and many potential institutional investors following the public filing of the S-1.

While completing the IPO is a significant priority for us and something we are laser-focused on we believe this is an attractive business and did not want to execute a transaction that would be detrimental to stakeholders in the long run. Absent something we don't see today we remain ready to execute on the IPO subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. And the next window will be in September. In the meantime throughout the summer we continue to make significant progress to position the business for long-term success.

I'll highlight three areas of focus. One expanding on our plan to achieve expense savings at Corebridge. Last quarter we estimated these savings to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million but we now expect to generate closer to $400 million of savings over the next three years with the majority of the run rate savings to be achieved in the next 24 months. Two progressing the implementation of a new operating model for our investments unit.

This includes our strategic partnership with Blackstone announced in July of 2021 and our partnership with BlackRock where we began moving assets under management in the second quarter of this year pursuant to the arrangement we announced in late March. And three planning our transition to BlackRock's Aladdin platform which will replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure and provide enhanced risk analytics and reporting. We continue to expect that Corebridge will pay an annual dividend of $600 million post-IPO that will have a payout ratio of 60% to 65% and that it will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months. Now turning to life and retirement's performance in the second quarter.

As I mentioned earlier adjusted pre-tax income was $563 million decreasing from the prior-year period due to lower NII which was driven by lower alternative investment income accelerated DAC amortization and an increase in SOP reserves. Given the pending IPO we remain somewhat limited in what we can say about the business but let me provide some details from the second quarter. The core business produced strong sales in fixed annuities which were up 48% to $1.4 billion and strong sales in indexed annuities which were flat at $1.5 billion. In group retirement contributions grew 1% nonrecurring deposits grew 4% and enrollments were up 11%.

Second quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were strong with base net investment spread growing 4 basis points sequentially due to the higher interest rate environment. The life and retirement balance sheet and capital position remains strong with an RBC ratio of 415% to 425% still above our target ranges. Now let me provide more detail on our second quarter results in general insurance where we continue to drive improved financial performance. Gross premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $9.6 billion with global commercial growing 8% and global personal decreasing 3%.

Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.9 billion. This growth was led by our global commercial business which grew 8% with global personal decreasing 4%. Global commercial net premiums written increased 10% excluding AIG Re where we have significantly reduced property CAT writings and exposure particularly in the Southeast region of the U.S. North America commercial net premiums written increased 10% or 14% excluding AIG Re.

And international net premiums written increased 5% or 8% excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to Russia exposure in each case on an FX-adjusted basis. In North America commercial we saw very strong growth in net premiums written: In Lexington which grew 31% led by wholesale property which was up 46%; retail property which grew 17%; and our Canadian commercial business which grew 10%. In international commercial on an FX-adjusted basis we also saw strong growth in net premiums written: In Global Specialty which grew 16% led by energy which was up 20%; and marine which was up 10%; North America Specialty which grew 17%; and international Specialty which grew 15%. In global commercial we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio with North America up 200 basis points to 85% and international holding steady at a very strong 86%.

As a reminder we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across global commercial our new business continues to be very strong coming in slightly over $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter. North America's new business grew to $542 million led by Lexington. International new business was $466 million slightly down year over year due to intentional actions we took in Talbot and in our Specialty business related to Russia Ukraine.

Turning to rate. Momentum continued in global commercial with overall rate increases of 7%. And in the aggregate rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This is the fourth consecutive year in which we're achieving rate above loss cost trends and where we are successfully driving margin expansion.

North America commercial achieved 7% rate increases with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Lexington which increased 18% with 17% in Lexington wholesale property; Financial Lines where professional increased 34% led by cyber which increased 52%; and excess casualty which increased 10%. International commercial rate increases were 7% driven by Financial Lines which increased 11% including more than 47% rate increases in cyber; property which increased 10%; and EMEA which also increased 10%. Last quarter we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the aggregate for North America commercial had migrated upwards from 4% to 5% mostly driven by shorter tail lines. And as a result we moved the upper end of the range to 5.5%.

In the second quarter trends in casualty and other liability lines continue to show no obvious impact in either internal or external data to support a large move on loss cost whereas property businesses have been more clearly affected. As a result based on a review of more recent information we again modified our view on loss cost trend to 6%. Loss cost trend represents the composite of frequency and severity. However there is an additional mitigant to inflation built into rate decisions.

Exposure trend which we view as a partial offset to loss cost trend reflects the additional premiums an insurer receives driven by growth in underlying inflation sensitive exposure basis. When taking this exposure mitigant into account our current North America commercial loss cost trend net of these inflationary exposure benefits is approximately 4%. Additionally our North America commercial accident year loss ratio ex CAT is booked at 63% year to date which is consistent with pure actuarial rate over loss cost and exposure trends but is a pure numerical approach and does not reflect our improved risk selection and continued improvement in terms of conditions. Those benefits will emerge over time.

As we discussed on prior calls since 2018 we have implemented a clear ventilation strategy in our casualty financial lines and property portfolios that directs our capacity deployment toward higher average attachment points which is a strong defensive measure toward rising inflation. And this strategy continues today. We also implemented the strategy in our AIG risk management loss-sensitive workers' compensation business. And over the last few years average deductibles have increased 30% to $1.3 million.

Turning to personal lines. In North America personal net premiums written declined nearly 4% driven by a reduction in warranty which was partially offset by a rebound in travel. In international personal net premiums written declined 4% on FX-adjusted basis also due to a reduction in warranty and partially offset by growth in accident and health and travel. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on our high-net-worth business.

This is a business we will continue to invest in where there are attractive opportunities for profitability improvement. Over the last two years and through the second quarter we've already invested $140 million to improve digital workflow data a customer interface that will provide enhanced insight and value to distribution partners and policyholders. The actions we are taking are designed to position this business to be more balanced with less density and lower volatility in order to provide more sustainable financial results. Let me review some of the market dynamics impacting this business that have created significant complexity and the resulting actions we are taking to reposition the portfolio.

Currently the level of reinsurance we purchased and the commensurate model ceded profit is a headwind to net premiums written growth and combined ratio improvement. This has been intentional as we are not willing to take volatility on frequency or tail risk on CAT in our high net worth business. Adding to this the inability to pass on increased loss and reinsurance costs through rate increases or limit management largely due to regulatory constraints further deteriorates margin in the short run. But we have made a deliberate decision to continue writing this business as we believe the trade-off is appropriate in the near term given the opportunity we see over the long term.

And while each of our CAT-exposed businesses has different attributes I don't see reinsurance costs for the high net worth market generally becoming less expensive for the foreseeable future but instead seeing it putting pressure on the segment. In fact for a business that is primarily underwritten in peak zones with high total insured values reinsurance costs will likely increase and in some cases materially. To understand the complexity of reinsurance for peak zones you need to look no further than in what has happened in the retrocessional market over the last few years. While overall small market retrocession provides approximately $60 billion of available limit across various structures of which roughly $20 billion is indemnity-based for reinsurers with this capacity primarily supported by alternative capital.

The dynamics in the retrocessional market over the last few years are important to understand because they have materially changed even though overall retrocessional capacity has remained flat since 2017. First the cost of retrocession has increased significantly more than in the reinsurance industry on a risk-adjusted basis. Second available capacity has shifted from predominantly aggregate to predominantly occurrence. Third first event aggregate and lower attaching occurrence retrocession have been put under significant stress.

Fourth the retrocessional market return period attachment points have increased 50%. And fifth compounded risk-adjusted rate changes have also increased by over 50% even though retrocessional exposure is reduced compared to prior year. When you couple these factors with the additional adjustments going forward for inflation model changes trapped capital you have a very complicated and challenging market. Additionally if you review global insured net cat retrocessional losses over the last decade nine out of 10 years have had larger contributions from secondary peril aggregate losses than peak peril losses which highlights the complexity of modeling catastrophes.

As a result of these dynamics and challenging circumstances we concluded that to continue to provide high-net-worth clients with comprehensive solutions that meet their emerging risk issues we needed to move property homeowners product to the non-admitted market particularly in CAT-exposed states. In the second quarter we exited the admitted personal property homeowners market in certain states as we could no longer maintain our level of aggregation especially given the inability to reflect the loss cost increases inflation and increased reinsurance costs and rates as well as limitations on our ability to make coverage changes in this market. As part of our go-forward high net worth strategy we're going to move homeowners and possibly other products in more states to the non-admitted market. And we plan to set up a structure that over time we expect to be supported by third-party capital providers in addition to AIG.

This structure will provide more flexibility to manage aggregation price limit terms and conditions and to innovate to solve evolving client needs. We will continue to provide coverage to our clients in the U.S. utilizing a hybrid model of non-admitted and admitted products in some states and admitted-only products in other states. We're already seeing the benefits of this strategy in our portfolio as the reduction in key catastrophe perils is apparent in these early stages.

For example since year-end 2021 gross wildfire PMLs are down approximately 35% to 40% across the entire PML return period curve. Now I want to review Russia Ukraine. Last quarter I addressed the many complexities and uncertainties that this situation presents particularly those related to aviation policies issued to airline operators and leasing companies including questions surrounding the occurrence of actual losses loss mitigation efforts whether any losses arise from war versus non-war apparels and the potential applicability of sanctions. These complexities and uncertainties very much continue.

The claims we have received continue to be largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. And we continue to reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses heavily comprised of IBNR despite the fact that the information we have received in connection with these claims remains very limited. Moreover in the event of losses and the lines of business we have outlined that are subject to a potential loss we have multiple reinsurance programs available. Turning to AIG 200.

We started this three-year journey in 2019. AIG 200 was designed to transform our core foundational capabilities across the company and our financial objective was to deliver $1 billion of exit run rate savings with a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. At the end of the second quarter we achieved these goals 6 months earlier than expected. Delivering on these critical operational and financial objectives is a major accomplishment for our team.

AIG 200 was successful because we maintained a tight governance structure and saw exceptional collaboration from colleagues across all major areas of the company. While the original objectives of AIG 200 have been completed our team will remain focused on continuous improvement in operational excellence. AIG 200 has put the company in a significantly better place. Specifically we modernized our IT platform retiring over 50% of our identified applications and moving 80% of our infrastructure to the public cloud.

We now have a global standard commercial underwriting platform that streamlines our processes and allows over 3000 underwriters to make better risk management decisions in real time. This platform also includes a new global location management system that allows us to better understand and manage our PML exposure. We made significant investments in key capabilities including building a consistent underlying data infrastructure enhancing our digital capabilities through new distribution partner and client portals linked to a single common call center platform and fundamentally streamlined our finance reporting capabilities for faster decision-making. And we streamlined our global operations and shared services capabilities by moving over 10000 roles to outsourcing partners.

I want to thank all of our colleagues involved in AIG 200 for their outstanding performance. They should take great pride in knowing they established a new infrastructure and foundation for AIG that we will continue to build on and that will drive benefits for our stakeholders now and in the future. Turning to our capital management strategy. We will continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio.

As I said earlier we had a very successful second quarter where we reduced net debt outstanding by $1.4 billion repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock paid $256 million in dividends and ended with $5.6 billion in parent liquidity. Looking ahead with respect to debt repayment AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the promissory note from life and retirement prior to the IPO. And we expect to use these proceeds to pay down additional AIG debt and for other purposes. With respect to share buybacks we have $5.8 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to repurchase at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter.

With respect to growth opportunities our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in general insurance where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns. As we discussed on our last call we expect that post deconsolidation of the life and retirement business AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details on ROE and on capital management in his remarks. Shane I'll turn the call over to you.

Shane Fitzsimons -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you Peter and good morning to all. As Peter noted I will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics specifically EPS liquidity leverage net investment income and ROCE. I will begin by providing more detail on the financial results of general insurance and life and retirement in the second quarter. I will then provide more detail on net investment income.

I will then review our balance sheet leverage AOCI liquidity and share count which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. And finally I want to provide you more detail on the execution path to 10% ROCE for AIG and more detail on what we intend to do to get there including income drivers expense reduction and AIG 200 where as Peter noted we have contracted or executed on our stated goal of $1 billion of exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of our original time line. Turning to EPS. Adjusted after-tax EPS was $1.19 per diluted common share.

Improvements in general insurance profit of $1.26 billion contributed $0.06 year over year. Within general insurance strong underwriting income of $799 million contributed $0.31 of improvement offset by a $0.25 decline in net investment income primarily driven by the decline in alternatives. And reduction in shares outstanding also contributed $0.10. Life and retirement declined $0.52 in APTI to $563 million which was below last year's second quarter primarily due to $0.36 or $387 million unfavorable from lower net investment income $0.19 or $202 million from accelerated DAC amortization and an increased SOP 03-1 reserves.

The net investment income decline in life and retirement was due to alternatives being down $0.21 and an $0.11 decline in yield enhancement income. As I noted general insurance's adjusted pre-tax income contribution in the second quarter was $1.26 billion which reflects strong underwriting profit growth and continued improvement in the calendar year combined ratio of 510 basis points to 87.4% and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 260 basis points to 88.5%. General insurance adjusted pre-tax income improved by $63 million year over year. Underwriting income improved by $336 million driven by a $182 million improvement in accident year underwriting income in addition to $137 million from an improved PYD offset by a reduction in alternative investment income in the quarter.

The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting income earned premium growth expense discipline low catastrophe losses and favorable PYD which all contributed to pre-tax underwriting income being up 73% year over year increasing to $799 million from $463 million. North America commercial had another 300 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior-year quarter coming in at 88.2%. International commercial also continued to improve profitability with 550 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter coming in at a strong 81.4% for the second quarter. North America personal had a 40 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior-year quarter coming in at 99.7%.

International personal experienced a 120 basis points deterioration in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT coming in at 95.2% for the second quarter. In the second quarter CAT losses were $121 million or 1.8 loss ratio points compared to $138 million or 2.1 loss ratio points in the prior-year quarter. Prior-year development excluding related premium adjustments was $202 million favorable this quarter compared to the favorable development of $51 million in the prior-year quarter. This quarter the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development.

And the balance of $160 million favorable arose mostly from old accident years in workers' compensation along with primary casualty lines in the U.S. The review in the quarter was mainly focused on North America and represents approximately 15% of reserves. Within both AIGRM loss-sensitive work comp and U.S. primary casualty lines there were additional indications of higher favorable development but we felt it prudent to wait and see how the inflationary environment evolves particularly as it relates to the casualty bodily injury and the medical side of workers' comp.

We look at this quarterly and as is our standard practice we will be reviewing approximately 75% of the total pre-ADC general insurance reserves in the third quarter. Life and retirement adjusted pre-tax income of $563 million compared to $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline was due to $387 million of lower net investment income of which $224 million is from lower alternative investment income as well as accelerated DAC and increased SOP reserves of $202 million driven by the market declines in the second quarter. The DAC and SOP charges had approximately 300 basis points negative impact on ROCE in the quarter but these are largely noncash.

Within individual retirement fixed annuity sales increased 48% year over year aided by origination activity to the Blackstone relationship. And fixed index annuity had another solid quarter of sales. Sales of variable annuities declined in the quarter consistent with market conditions. Net flows were positive $628 million this quarter compared to negative net flows of $77 million in the prior-year quarter.

And variable and indexed annuity spreads expanded two basis points from the first quarter of 2022. Group retirement had strong deposits in the quarter of $1.8 billion while surrenders declined and base net investment spread was up four basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Life insurance adjusted pre-tax income was $117 million. The second quarter represented the lowest COVID mortality quarter since the pandemic began while non-COVID mortality also ran favorable in the period.

Premiums and deposits also continued to benefit from the solid international life sales which comprise approximately 45% of new sales activity. Our previously reported level of spread rate compression has been in the range of 8 to 16 basis points annually. But given current market conditions we now expect to be better than 8 basis points for the full year. As you are aware for the life and retirement business we conduct our entire reserve review in the third quarter.

However with the recent focus on the guaranteed universal life product I will provide a few comments. First this is not a large block for us. So we do not have much exposure in our in-force block which is approximately $3 billion in net statutory reserves which represents 2% of our net liabilities. For context we did participate in the recent industry study on this topic.

And our projected lapse rates fund bases and dynamic premium modeling approach are consistent with the recommendations of the study. As additional background over the last five years we have been reviewing and strengthening our reserve assumptions for the guaranteed universal life product. And as a result we don't expect significant adjustments. Turning to other operations which includes interest expense corporate general operating expenses institutional asset management expense runoff portfolio and eliminations it was a positive contributor to adjusted pre-tax income year over year by $149 million.

Corporate general operating expenses improved $74 million year over year in the second quarter benefiting from AIG 200 and continued emphasis on expense management. Adjusted pre-tax net investment income for the quarter was $2.5 billion a decline of $678 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder we report the results of our private equity holdings on a one-quarter lag and we may have an impact in the third quarter as well. Over the last few years we focused on improving the risk profile of the investment portfolio with continued vigilance around corporate and consumer credit and a strong capital and liquidity profile in both general insurance and life and retirement which support our ability to manage through difficult times as evidenced by our financial stability through COVID.

In life and retirement our weighted average credit rating has improved since the end of 2015 while the percentage of capital-intensive assets has declined in the portfolio from 10.5% to 8.3%. In the second quarter we continued the proactive steps in the investment portfolio to avoid potential overexposure in the event credit deteriorates. We sold RMBS and ABS securities with a market value of $3.2 billion in the second quarter. In addition we have alternative investments particularly hedge funds that have generated good returns over time but with more quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and that is more volatility than we would prefer.

Going forward we would expect to move over time to an asset allocation with less volatility. We've also executed on sales of approximately $4 billion of low-yielding longer-duration corporate bonds to buy higher-yielding shorter-duration structured securities privates ABS and CMLs with many of them being floaters. We feel it is appropriate to take advantage of the higher rate environment and turn the portfolio over a little more quickly than would naturally occur at maturity thereby enhancing our forward APTI and ROCE. The second quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields with a 65 basis point increase on the 10-year or 146 basis points through June 30th.

With general insurance and life and retirement portfolio durations are just under four and eight years respectively the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns. Our base fixed income portfolio saw a lift in yield of 18 basis points in the second quarter versus first quarter with $17 million additional within general insurance and $28 million additional in life and retirement. The new money yield on our base portfolio was approximately 80 basis points above the assets rolling off the portfolio during the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter the new money yield is roughly 130 basis points higher than the overall current portfolio in general insurance and roughly 75 basis points higher in life and retirement.

Moving on to the balance sheet leverage and liquidity. As Peter noted we closed the quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity. The second quarter includes execution of $1.7 billion in share repurchases $256 million of common and preferred dividends and $1.4 billion net spend on debt reduction actions including AIG debt retirement and extinguishment costs of $7.9 billion that is partially offset by the Corebridge debt issuance of $6.5 billion. In the second quarter we saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increasing interest rates.

Adjusted AOCI which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude moved from negative $5.9 billion to negative $15.4 billion or an additional reduction of $9.5 billion. We exited the second quarter with GAAP leverage of 31.1% up from 27.8% a 330 basis point increase quarter over quarter. The decrease in AOCI in the period added 390 basis points to the leverage ratio. This was partially offset by the net debt reduction of $1.3 billion in the period in addition to net income gains.

The impact of AOCI is substantially larger in life and retirement and general insurance given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. At quarter end our debt leverage ratio excluding AOCI was 25.3% down 60 basis points versus 25.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Total adjusted return on common equity was 7% down from 10.5% in 2Q '21. And total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 7.6%.

The decrease is mostly caused by decline in net investment income. general insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12% in the second quarter while life and retirement was 7.6%. life and retirement's ROCE was impacted by approximately 300 basis point drag from the acceleration of DAC an increase in the SOP 03-1 reserves in the second quarter. Adjusted book value per share of $72.23 increased 2.1% sequentially and 20.2% year over year.

Adjusted tangible book value per share of $66.06 increased 2.2% sequentially and 21.8% year over year. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized with general insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter estimated to be between 475% and 485%. And the life and retirement U.S.

fleet estimated to be between 415% and 425% both above our target ranges. Finally during the quarter we repurchased approximately 30 million shares at an average cost of $58.25 bringing our GAAP ending share count to 771 million with the quarterly average of 801 million compared to 873 million in the prior-year quarter representing an 8% reduction in average share count. As we previously disclosed our agreement with Blackstone includes an exchange right put option which is not exercisable until November of 2024. That gives Blackstone the right to exchange their stake in Corebridge for shares in AIG.

Under the applicable accounting principles this put option was dilutive in the second quarter and resulted in 43 million additional shares outstanding for the purposes of the adjusted EPS calculations in the period. It is worth noting that this put option goes away upon the execution of the IPO. Looking ahead we have four priorities which all lead to ROCE improvement toward our 10% or greater goal: continued momentum on underwriting excellence expense reduction through operational excellence and expense discipline the successful IPO and separation of the life and retirement business and continued execution on our capital management priorities. Continued momentum on underwriting excellence will include further improvements in our underwriting profitability without an increase in volatility as well as underwriting portfolio optimization which involves both measured growth on proper leverage to optimize return allocation.

While we have made significant progress to date we are still achieving written rate above trends both in business today and that which we have not yet earned in. Expense reduction will come through continued cost discipline operational excellence earn-in of AIG 200 run rate savings and a reduction of parent GOE. As Peter mentioned we have now contracted or executed on $1 billion of savings related to AIG 200 and we have realized $610 million of savings to date. That leaves $390 million of savings that AIG expects to earn in over the coming 12 to 18 months.

We also expect roughly $300 million of the AIG corporate expenses will move to life and retirement upon deconsolidation. In addition as Peter stated we now expect life and retirement to execute a cost savings program which will generate close to $400 million in savings and expect the program to deliver the first $100 million before year-end. With respect to the execution on our capital management priorities we have already accelerated our share repurchases this year and expect additional repurchases as we get more clarity on the timing of the proceeds from the Corebridge IPO. Contemplated in our current plan which includes the completion of the Corebridge IPO we expect to reduce our share count to somewhere in the range of 600 million to 650 million shares while maintaining leverage in the 20% to 25% level along with strong capitalization at the insurance subsidiary company level.

Each of these drivers has some elements of tailwind to them. Additionally yield enhancement in the base investment portfolio should provide meaningful lift in earnings power over time based on the current economic backdrop. To date we're beginning to see the benefit of higher yields driving higher base portfolio returns where we are not dependent on higher interest rates to achieve our goal. These focus areas give us a line of sight to a minimum of 300 to 400 basis points of ROCE improvement.

We will continue to provide updates over time. And with that I will turn the call back over to you Peter.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Great. Thank you Shane. And operator we're prepared to take questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you Peter. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Meyer Shields at KBW. Meyer you may unmute.

Meyer Shields -- Keefe Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst

Great. Thanks. Good morning. Peter you provided a ton of information on rates and trend and exposure.

But I was hoping we could dig a little deeper specifically into the exposure benefits for liability lines where premiums are based on receipts but maybe the relationship between receipts and losses is not as obvious as let's say in property and we've got the concerns of longer tail lines.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure Meyer. Thank you for the question. Like you said we've provided a lot of information in our prepared remarks. But I think Mark why don't you go through what the effects are in exposure and also talk a little bit about sort of the loss ratio implications in the observations that we made.

Mark Lyons -- Executive Vice President Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management

Happy to. So a couple of things come to mind. First off as Peter mentioned North America commercial aggregate loss trend is now up to 6% this quarter as opposed to our upper revision we did last quarter the 5.5% because we look at that every quarter. Short-tailed lines are driving much of this increase and that is seen in our own data as well as external information.

And over the last few years because I'm talking about the weighted average loss cost trend there the North American portfolio has reduced its property writings and has shrunk as a percentage of total which helps ameliorate the growth in severity. So -- but we're seeing commercial property line loss cost trends of roughly 10% and in specialty-oriented property lines closer to 15% driven by inflationary trends in construction materials replacement costs labor transportation things of that nature. Our view of casualty bodily injury and the medical side of work comp though is unchanged from last quarter. And recall that even that reflected an increment of anticipatory medical cost increase.

But as Peter said in his prepared remarks we have yet to see it within our own data or with relevant external data. Now I think getting into some of your question as well it's hard to discuss loss cost trend without discussing the related topic of margin which reflects the exposure trend and how that mitigates the loss cost trend that we've already just talked about. The aggregate North American commercial book has an approximate 2% exposure trend which as you mentioned represents additional collected premium due to the positive impact of the underlying inflation-sensitive exposure basis to which the rates are applied. And therefore it does function as a partial inflation mitigant.

And examples of that would be one of our growth engines which is Lexington which has approximately 60% of their book based on inflation-sensitive exposure basis. And another one would be retail property where the focus on accurate and current statement of values is razor sharp in that level of focus. So the exposure trend is partially mitigating these loss cost trends which then produces the approximate 4% all-in loss ratio trend that Peter commented on. But -- so when you put that in conjunction with the 7% rate increases achieved in the quarter we're in excess of loss cost trend and loss ratio trend let alone the loss ratio benefits of tighter terms and conditions.

And rate change alone really doesn't tell the whole picture. We've spoken before about the power of the primary especially in D&O. AIG's position there permits deploying ventilate capacity as we see fit but just as important is the stronger pricing power resident in the primary versus high excess which is fast becoming a good commodity driven by high price or highly by price and seeing the largest rate reductions. That's the strength of the primary.

But I think lastly just I think a clarification it may or may make some sense so think of it this way let's not get confused on the difference between a real underlying exposure to loss with the measurement of that exposure to loss. So to keep it simple if storekeeper A buys a GL policy which is mostly a premises policy and the insurer uses square footage as the exposure base then the premium paid is rate times square footage of course. And next year if there is no rate change he'll have the same premium. However if storekeeper B has an identical store in the same geographic area and the same sales volume but their insurer instead rates on gross receipts and those receipts are 3% higher this year than last year the true underlying exposure as measured by the propensity to have a claim didn't change but the measurement of that exposure did change.

So storekeeper B's premium will be 3% higher than that charged by insurer A even though the stores are identical in every way.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

That's great Mark. Thank you. Meyer is there a follow-up?

Meyer Shields -- Keefe Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst

Yes. Just a very brief one really on the last comment. Is there an opportunity or an advantage to maybe shifting even more of the premium Phase 2 inflation-sensitive exposure?

Mark Lyons -- Executive Vice President Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management

Yes. I mean it's -- that is a potential strategy that you'd -- a little difficult to implement right because you have -- part of a profitable portfolio are those things rated -- inflation exposure basis like premises. However when you get into other lines like the M&C side of GL Meyer I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I think maybe I'd just add to that and we'll take the next question which is all the significant repositioning we've done in the excess and surplus lines particularly with the Lexington. You hear a lot about in the prepared remarks because they've done such a great job between growth rate retention and pivoting that portfolio to be a significant contributor in terms of profitability improvement. I mean we've gotten on property alone 16 consecutive quarters of double-digit rate increases.

And as Mark alluded to that just starts to drive margins. So we are repositioning the portfolio based on where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. OK. We'll take the next question.

Operator

Our next question will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous. Erik you may unmute your line.

Erik Bass -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst

Good morning. Thank you. So with the Corebridge IPO it sounds like your strategy is to remain patient and wait for markets to recover since you're not a forced seller. Is this the right take? Or if the IPO window opens in the fall would you look to take advantage and get some stock floated even if at a modest discount to what you view as the ultimate fair value?

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thanks Erik. We provided a lot of sort of guidance in our prepared remarks but let me try to add to it. Our plan has always been to do an IPO of Corebridge and that has not changed.

So now we are targeting September. I mean we gave you some of the variables but obviously there's more to consider like you outlined. We just felt that the market conditions in the second quarter were not conducive. We always intend to own greater than 50% following the IPO.

And therefore we'll continue to consolidate results for the foreseeable future. The base case is still to do secondary offerings but those will likely take place in 2023. And so look we're going to watch the market. We always have to be careful in terms of the conditions that exist in the regulatory approvals.

But our base case has just shifted from May June to September. And we'll watch it carefully and we'd like to get it floating.

Erik Bass -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you. And then one follow-up on Corebridge. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the performance of your VA hedging program this quarter and the movements in the RBC ratio that we saw.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes Shane you and Kevin want to provide some insight on that?

Kevin Hogan -- Chief Executive Officer of Life and Retirement

Yes so --

Shane Fitzsimons -- Chief Financial Officer

Go ahead Kevin.

Kevin Hogan -- Chief Executive Officer of Life and Retirement

So Erik yes our VA -- the hedging program our economic target-based hedging program has continued to perform as we have expected throughout all of the market volatility. It is an economic target-based hedging program and so the RBC decline was in part due to the variable annuity and index annuity portfolios. And as you know those market impacts are reversible as markets recover. So we have hedged all Hedgeable economic risks.

We have an open credit spread position which we believe is offset by our general account credit portfolio and the hedge has performed as we have designed it.

Erik Bass -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst

Got it.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you Kevin. Thanks Eric. I think we have one last question. Operator we'll turn it to you.

Operator

Our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian you may unmute your line.

Brian Meredith -- UBS -- Analyst

Thanks. Yes. Two quick questions here for you. First one thanks for all the detail on the expense outlook going forward.

I'm just curious is there another plan expense reduction program for the general insurance business post the Corebridge split? And Pete I'm curious is there a G&A expense ratio did you think you need to be at or a target you're looking at to be among the most competitive from an expense leverage perspective in the commercial insurance business?

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thanks Brian. Yes. So as we said we're really proud and pleased that we just finished AIG 200 and that will start to continue to earn in.

The work that we did in the summer for Corebridge we increased our expectations there over the three-year period to be now at the upper end of the range of $400 million. So our primary focus is the underwriting excellence in terms of the improvement the focus on continuing AIG 200 and making sure that operational excellence becomes a core part of the organization which it already has but we want to continue that and then making sure that the separation of Corebridge is done flawlessly. At the same time we are looking at our overall cost structure. There's a ton of work underway.

And as we start executing on those other pieces there will be -- Shane put in his prepared remarks where we're going to get out a meaningful amount up to $500 million more of expenses. That's the remaining company within AIG. So that will start to get executed. As we start to deconsolidate we'll have a path forward as we flow Corebridge and be able to give you more guidance.

I don't have a percentage. I focus on the nominal in terms of -- when I look at even like general insurance over the last five quarters where we've invested a lot in the business the nominal GOE has not gone up. I mean so the expense discipline is there. And we want to continue to benefit from the earned savings with AIG 200 and what we will take out in terms of the combined entity when we go forward.

But we want to have an organization that is going to be world-class in terms of its overall expense ratios. And I think we've proven that we not only can take it out in a really constructive way because we're investing for the future but we maintain that level going forward. We have growth opportunities in the top line which will help the ratios. I mean the commercial business is growing excluding AIG Re which the reason why I've excluded is that we're not trying to grow that business based on the CAT exposures today but growing at 10%.

We see opportunities to grow in the future when we look to the back half of this year. We have very strong retention. The new business that's been coming in is going to be more retained. It's the fifth quarter in a row where we produced more than $1 billion of new business all very positive all helpful to our ratios.

And so we feel like we have a lot of momentum.

Brian Meredith -- UBS -- Analyst

Great. That's really helpful. And then one last question on the whole exposure loss trend. Everybody is talking about increasing exposure.

What happens if we go into a recession? Can that actually hurt your ability to see -- accrete margin?

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I don't think so based on the makeup of the portfolio. But Mark why don't we end where we started with you just to give a little bit of perspective and then you can turn it back to me.

Mark Lyons -- Executive Vice President Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management

Yeah. Thank you Peter. And Brian good to hear from you. So to your question remember what Dave McElroy and his team are doing Lexington is becoming an increasing proportion of the business.

And on a non-admitted basis you have a lot of interesting terms and conditions like minimum earned premiums. So even if that does fall off a bit that doesn't necessarily translate on a downward movement.

Brian Meredith -- UBS -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Peter Zaffino -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Mark. Thanks a lot Brian. Have a great day. And thanks everybody for joining us.

Really appreciate the time and have a great day.

Close to 2.5 million Venezuelans are living in Colombia having fled their home country’s economic collapse and political crisis. While Bogotá has generously offered residency rights many migrants and refugees nevertheless face extreme hardship and have few resources to sustain themselves. Why does it matter? Thriving armed and criminal groups in Colombia’s cities and countryside have absorbed Venezuelans as cheap recruits often deploying them for high-visibility crimes while exposing them to great physical danger. Xenophobia toward Venezuelans has risen sharply surging during periods of unrest. What should be done? The new Colombian government and donors should cooperate to improve protection of arriving migrants including by diverting them from violent areas and help them get access to the formal labour market. Rebuilding ties between Colombia and Venezuela will be vital to giving migrants an option to return safely home.

Executive Summary

Colombia has welcomed millions of Venezuelans fleeing their homeland but many remain at risk in the country. Venezuelans have fanned out across the Americas but by far the largest number close to 2.5 million have settled in Colombia where governments sympathetic to the distress across the border and cool to leaders in Caracas have offered them residency and services. These policies stand out for their compassion but are not matched by sufficient economic or other support. Penniless migrants and refugees are vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Many have little choice but to rely on informal work and are vulnerable to recruitment into armed groups or street gangs. As the Venezuelans’ role in criminal outfits has grown more prominent xenophobia directed at them has also increased. To break this cycle Colombian authorities should work with partners to offer better protections for Venezuelans and to strengthen legal economic opportunities. Colombian President Gustavo Petro’s plan to restore dialogue with Caracas will be essential to ensuring that migrants can pass safely between the two countries. Escaping a huge economic contraction rising insecurity collapsing public services and a political crackdown over six million migrants and refugees from Venezuela have sought a new safer life abroad over the past decade – with most leaving home since 2017. From these Venezuelans’ perspective Colombia boasts several attractions as a destination: it shares a porous 2200km frontier with its neighbour making it possible albeit dangerous to cross even when official borders are closed; its governments have been highly critical of Caracas; and it has offered residency and access to public services to the newcomers. Moreover until the onset of COVID-19 its economy was enjoying steady growth with thriving labour markets in its big cities. But in other ways Colombia is one of the least suitable Latin American countries to receive a mass migrant exodus. Over decades various fronts of a vicious multi-pronged internal war caused the country to suffer some of the world’s highest rates of forced displacement – and drove out millions of migrants and refugees. Colombia has had no previous experience of offering shelter and respite to so many migrants and its lack of know-how and capacity is conspicuous. The country’s cash-based informal economy accounts for close to half of all jobs and is characterised by paltry erratic pay – particularly for Venezuelans who for lack of formal alternatives often accept wages considerably lower than what locals receive. In poor rural areas both close to the border with Venezuela and in remote corners elsewhere the most easily available employment is often to be found in illicit business and among armed and criminal groups. Despite the 2016 agreement with the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) which brought an end to the country’s largest insurgency and mapped out a route to lasting peace splinter groups (known as “dissident” factions) and other armed bands continue to coerce communities and perpetrate acts of violence throughout large parts of the country. Migrants have been immersed in conflict zones with no understanding of the unwritten rules for survival. Coca production and illegal mining have become major sources of work for Venezuelans; human trafficking and sexual exploitation plague border towns (and big cities as well) with women and minors in special danger. Gender-based violence is particularly common at informal border crossings under criminal control where the means of protecting victims are generally absent. Struggling with high unemployment bouts of social unrest and since 2020 the effects of COVID-19 Colombia’s big cities have likewise proven inhospitable. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans ended up walking back to the border in the first months of the pandemic after the state prohibited their work as streets vendors causing many to be evicted from cramped lodgings. Just as armed groups in the countryside lure Venezuelan recruits with one-off payments food and shelter urban gangs have targeted desperate migrants many of them sleeping rough (an estimated 16 per cent of homeless people in Colombia are now Venezuelan). Employed by gangs as part of their growing work force migrants offer cheap labour as street fighters drug dealers and hit men. Although working under the orders of illicit Colombian groups the high-visibility crimes perpetrated by migrants have fuelled xenophobia toward Venezuelans. Migrants who have been exploited for their vulnerability and poverty are regularly vilified by members of the public and politicians as the cause of low wages insecurity and public disorder.

Preventing recruitment of migrants and refugees by armed and criminal groups is essential both to the safety of Venezuelans and the broader cause of peace and security in Colombia.

Preventing recruitment of migrants and refugees by armed and criminal groups is essential both to the safety of Venezuelans and the broader cause of peace and security in Colombia. Crucial steps toward this end should include strengthening migrant reception services close to the border or in big cities; improving support for all newcomers seeking safe passage to their destination; and making migrants aware of the perils of involvement with organised crime. More safe houses for sexually exploited and trafficked women and children along the border are also an acute need. But Colombia cannot do all these things by itself. Foreign partners and international bodies working on migration conflict gender and humanitarian emergencies should help the cash-strapped Colombian state foot the bill. In certain areas however the incoming government in Bogotá will have to assume primary responsibility. Where Venezuelans have found themselves embroiled in violence they should be given the right to be registered as victims of Colombia’s conflict which by law entitles them to reparation payments and special judicial attention. The Colombian state should also strive to iron out the difficulties Venezuelan migrants encounter in trying to join the formal economy by taking additional steps to recognise their educational qualifications and providing vocational training where necessary. Stricter law enforcement to ensure Venezuelan employees are not exploited or underpaid in their work thereby undercutting protections for Colombians could help relieve the labour market frictions that the migration wave has created. President Petro’s goal of patching up severed ties between the Colombian and Venezuelan governments is also long overdue. Communication channels between border provinces enabled pedestrian traffic to resume through the main formal crossings in late 2021. But the incoming Colombian government has made clear it wishes to restore full diplomatic and consular relations while Petro himself has stressed the need for the two states to work together in improving security and boosting formal trade along the border. A fragile stabilisation of Venezuela’s economy driven in large part by use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender in the country has raised the prospect that more migrants can go back to their home country voluntarily. Making sure there is safe passage in both directions will require far more cooperation between the two states as well as support from international agencies. Colombia’s offer of a safe haven for Venezuelans is both a grand gesture of solidarity and a promise the country has been hard pressed to meet. Stronger protection upon migrants’ arrival clear routes to the formal labour market restored bilateral ties and a safe way to return home if desired are vital to protecting migrants from the lures and dangers of crime and exploitation with all the ill effects that those may bring. Bogotá/Washington/Brussels 9 August 2022

I. Introduction

Over the past quarter-century migration out of Venezuela has come in three successive stages prompted by political tumult economic and social unrest and a deep humanitarian crisis. The first wave included affluent Venezuelans in possession of passports and sufficient funds to book a flight many of them leaving during President Hugo Chávez’s rule (1999-2013). During the second wave between 2016 and 2017 many middle-income families departed primarily to other South American countries. Finally since 2018 people lacking resources to travel and often without passports have headed out on foot becoming known as los caminantes (the walkers). As time passed worsening conditions – including hunger extreme poverty a failing health system and widespread violence – have accelerated the exodus. Around one fifth of Venezuela’s population of 30 million has moved abroad over the past decade with most of this migration occurring since 2017. Of the six million Venezuelans who have left their country since 2013 nearly 2.5 million live in Colombia which shares a 2200km border with Venezuela and which has in many respects presented itself as a welcoming neighbour. Successive governments have sought to assure incoming migrants and refugees of their rights to stay work and enjoy access to social services. Leaders in Bogotá have won plaudits from foreign officials and international humanitarian bodies for their efforts to provide newly arrived Venezuelans with a degree of protection including through special residency permits and close working arrangements with UN agencies and donors to handle the migrant inflow. But laudable as these efforts have been Colombia has struggled to provide Venezuelan migrants with the support they need a problem with both humanitarian and security implications. Many migrants suffer extreme economic hardship and violent intimidation in a country still troubled by armed and criminal outfits and with its own long history of forced displacement. For many Colombians the visible face of Venezuela’s humanitarian emergency consists of the migrants scraping by in the country’s cities where organised crime often has more absorptive capacity than formal businesses or state employment schemes. But many migrants also end up in rural and conflict-affected regions. Although the largest insurgency in the country the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) handed over its weapons following the 2016 peace accord an array of armed groups continues to plague rural areas. Migrants can now be found in the most remote corners of Colombia working in rackets that help fund these groups and their activities including illegal gold mining fuel smuggling and coca growing.

A rupture in diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela in February 2019 ... deepened the difficulties faced by migrants.

A rupture in diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela in February 2019 only deepened the difficulties faced by migrants. Whether seeking to cross a frequently closed formal border return safely to family in their homeland obtain official documents or receive basic consular services migrants have found their efforts thwarted by the refusal of President Iván Duque’s government in Bogotá to entertain any sort of relationship with President Nicolás Maduro. But major changes are afoot in Colombia and the question is what happens now. President Gustavo Petro’s victory at the polls in June and his formal inauguration on 7 August made him Colombia’s first left-wing president in recent history auguring a dramatic switch in policy direction for Bogotá on many key issues including relations with Caracas. Despite his historical differences with the Maduro government Petro spoke with the Venezuelan president days after his election and declared that borders between the two countries would be fully reopened; he also made clear throughout his campaign that he would restore ties with Venezuela. Petro is also expected to renew efforts to negotiate with Colombia’s current largest guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (ELN) which has a presence on both sides of the border and has flourished deeper inside Venezuela in recent years. As the political transition proceeds in Bogotá this report examines the challenges faced by Venezuelan migrants who have sought safe harbour in Colombia including the risk of being recruited into criminal and armed groups and how their vulnerability in this regard has affected public perceptions of them. Focusing on the second and third migratory waves described above the report explores the ways in which the Colombian state has sought to support migrants; the difficulties it has encountered in doing so particularly during the pandemic; and the gaps in support and protection that the new government will need to fill. This report is based on interviews with about 90 state and local officials migrants civil society leaders diplomats and aid workers between November 2019 and July 2022. Research was conducted through visits to Colombian regions including Bajo Cauca the Pacific north-eastern Antioquia Arauca and Catatumbo as well as the cities of Villavicencio Medellín Cúcuta and Bogotá.

II. A Mass Exodus and a Hard Landing

Prior to the Venezuelan migrant exodus of the past decade Colombia had not experienced a major inflow of migrants or refugees. The Venezuelan crisis thus forced a largely unprepared country to adapt at speed. Colombia welcomed Venezuelan migrants but their arrival aggravated existing social tensions and placed a new set of demands on the country’s already taxed institutions.

A. Mass Migration’s Drivers

Venezuela’s economic collapse has been a primary engine driving recent waves of migration into Colombia. A massive contraction prompted by ill-considered state interventions falling oil prices and corruption and worsened by the imposition of U.S. financial and economic sanctions from 2017 onward shaved 74 per cent off Venezuela’s gross domestic product between 2014 and 2020. Recent studies have indicated that 95 per cent of Venezuelans remaining in their country live in poverty and 77 per cent in extreme poverty following this nosedive which caused the monthly minimum wage to decline to a few dollars by early 2022 although it has risen since. Dollarisation of Venezuela’s economy has afforded a modicum of stability by tempering hyperinflation but salaries for public-sector employees remain very low and economic conditions are still forbiddingly tough for most people. The country’s economic straits are linked to its political crisis which has also escalated under the government of President Maduro. Following his election in 2013 economic collapse rising insecurity and shortages of food and medicines created the backdrop for an opposition victory in the 2015 legislative contests. Two years later the government stripped the opposition-held National Assembly of its powers. Amid intensifying political conflict and an authoritarian clampdown by the government the opposition boycotted the 2018 presidential polls which Maduro won. Arguing that the vote was fraudulent and unfair the speaker of the National Assembly Juan Guaidó asserted his claim to be “interim president” in early 2019 and won recognition from over 50 countries including the U.S. Subsequent attempts by elements of the opposition to unseat Maduro including a civil-military uprising and a mercenary invasion failed to achieve their goal enabling the president to consolidate his hold on power. Increasing repression has also been a hallmark of the Maduro administration. While repression and widespread abuse are not the main causes of migration they are among the reasons migrants cite for leaving the country. The UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela has condemned state authorities for a wide variety of human rights violations including arbitrary arrests and disappearances by security forces and stated that instead of protecting rights and freedoms judicial authorities have facilitated impunity. In November 2021 the International Criminal Court announced a formal investigation into possible crimes against humanity in Venezuela allegedly committed by security forces.

Flare-ups of fighting between FARC “dissident” factions ... and the Venezuelan army ... has forced Venezuelans to flee across the border.

One further cause pushing Venezuelans to leave their country has only surfaced in the last year or so. Since early 2021 flare-ups of fighting between FARC “dissident” factions (ie splinters of the disbanded organisation) and the Venezuelan army in the border state of Apure has forced Venezuelans to flee across the border. Of the at least 6000 uprooted people who crossed into Colombia in early 2021 several hundred were displaced from Apure state to the departments of Arauca and Vichada in Colombia including over a dozen families of the Jivi ethnic tribe. Even though Colombia is right next door crossing the border is a perilous endeavour. Due to border closures or their lack of travel documents many Venezuelans have no alternative but to walk over informal tracks (trochas) controlled by armed groups and gangs that charge fees for passage and are frequently violent. An estimated 63 per cent of families entering Colombia did so over irregular border crossings. Corrupt police officers may also benefit by collecting extortion fees of roughly 5000 Colombian pesos ($1.25) from motorcyclists transporting food products such as eggs across the border from Colombia to Venezuela. Venezuelans have also reported abuses by Colombian migration officials including throwing water at sleeping migrants sometimes beating people who need to spend the night outside near their offices and destroying valid identity documents.

B. Permits to Stay

In 2017 as migration from Venezuela surged President Juan Manuel Santos’ government created the Permiso Especial de Permanencia or special residency permit to enable incoming Venezuelans to stay legally in Colombia. Colombian solidarity with Venezuelan migrants reflected an expression of sympathy with their flight from an increasingly authoritarian government as well as a pragmatic understanding that migrants could not be stopped from coming across a long porous border. The permit granted registered migrants two years of residency access to social services and a work permit. Appointment of a border czar working in the presidential offices helped streamline coordination among ministries and state agencies handling the migrant flow and cut red tape enabling around 660000 Venezuelans to obtain residency permits within three years. Even so ranging from 2017 to 2021 between 41 per cent and 57 per cent of Venezuelans in Colombia still had no formal legal authority to stay because of administrative hurdles and the lack of capacity to process permit requests. In response to increasing migrant numbers President Duque’s government developed new legislation enacted in May 2021 that granted Venezuelans temporary protection status (known as the Estatuto Temporal de Protección para Migrantes Venezolanos). Widely praised abroad for its generous provisions the statute affords Venezuelan migrants who obtain a permit ten-year residency and allows them access to public education health care and the job market. By February 2022 about 2.4 million Venezuelans or 96 per cent of the migrant population had applied for a protection permit with Colombian migration authorities having approved nearly 1.4 million by July 2022. Still not all Venezuelan migrants are eligible to apply. Those who cannot prove their date of entry or provide valid identification documents are subject to deportation spawning a black market in “service providers” who offer to fix paperwork. Venezuelans living in rural areas and lacking funds for travel often find it difficult to reach towns where the permits are handed out.

C. For Many a Precarious Home in the City

Conditions remain challenging for many migrants and refugees upon arrival in Colombia. Whereas food fuel and medicine are generally not scarce finding work in Colombia’s formal economy and the means to purchase goods can be an ordeal. By the end of 2021 48 per cent of workers were employed in the informal economy a rate that rose to 70 per cent in the town of Cúcuta the largest Colombian city close to the border with Venezuela and home to nearly 170000 Venezuelan migrants. An estimated 90 per cent of Venezuelans working in Colombia are employed in the informal economy where pay tends to be lower and more erratic. Venezuelan migrants have mainly settled in Colombia’s big cities. Some 495000 Venezuelans are registered in the capital Bogotá while another 191000 are located in Medellín Colombia’s second biggest city. After that come the border city Cúcuta Cali Colombia’s third largest conurbation located in the south west and the Caribbean port of Barranquilla.

Many poorer Venezuelans end up in informal accommodation or pay-per-day rooms called 'pagadiarios' …. commonly described by their inhabitants as miserable and inhumane.

Cities present specific challenges for many migrants. Those who have been unable to get their hands on a legal stay permit or lack a stable income face difficulties in obtaining apartment leases. For this reason many poorer Venezuelans end up in informal accommodation or pay-per-day rooms called pagadiarios a predominantly urban phenomenon. Conditions in these facilities are commonly described by their inhabitants as miserable and inhumane. Entire families cluster together in tiny rooms and share mattresses. “The state does not provide economic guarantees and migrants look for their own solutions” a state official said of these housing conditions. To pay for these pagadiarios many Venezuelans join the informal street economy selling products such as cigarettes rubbish bags and sweets. What is earned during the day is spent after work on food and nightly accommodation. Experts who work closely with migrants warn that the owners of temporary accommodation sometimes entice tenants into taking part in criminal activities or ask for sexual favours as a means of paying the rent. Venezuelans are also vulnerable to being kicked out when unable to pay. Mass eviction became an acute problem in Colombia during the first COVID-19 lockdown from March 2020 when social distancing rules prohibited street vendors from working outside in effect denying many migrants their only source of income. Lockdowns forced tens of thousands of Venezuelans to walk back to their native land where they could at least find a place to stay with family or friends after losing their livelihoods and being turned out into the street by landlords despite a ban on dislodging tenants during the pandemic’s early stages. Due to their precarious employment conditions and poverty some 31 per cent of Venezuelan families indicated in a recent survey that they risked eviction because they could not pay rent and utilities while about a quarter of refugee and migrant households in Colombia face food insecurity and consume poor-quality water.

D. Labour Market Difficulties

Most of the Venezuelans in Colombia yearn for stable paid employment. But their chances of gaining work are limited and the opportunities on offer are often far from desirable. At least 24 per cent of Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Colombia are unemployed according to the state statistical institute. For those who have work conditions are often harsh. About 41 per cent of the Venezuelans in Colombia work more than 48 hours a week – above the legal limit on working hours – and often make considerably less money than their Colombian peers. In the construction industry for example a Colombian employee can earn up to 70000 Colombian pesos ($17.5) a day while a Venezuelan is paid about 30000 pesos ($7.5) even if he is similarly skilled. Low pay affects Venezuelan women even more acutely than men with earnings 26.5 per cent less than those of a Venezuelan man according to a 2019 survey. Venezuelan women are frequently the primary breadwinners for their households; as a result they are especially vulnerable to being exploited in order to support their children. In the border city of Cúcuta some restaurants pay Venezuelan women half what they would pay Colombian citizens. Legal stay permits including residency visas and temporary protection status are no guarantee that Venezuelans can gain access to legal employment or avoid discrimination. In Bogotá some stores state in their vacancy notices that Venezuelans should not apply.

When Venezuelans do get work but at lower pay rates they can find themselves at odds with the Colombian work force.

When Venezuelans do get work but at lower pay rates they can find themselves at odds with the Colombian work force. Colombian workers who lose their jobs or face difficulties looking for new employment because of competition with Venezuelan migrants experience acute frustration. Even among migrants excessively low pay can generate grudges. Women who clean houses but refuse to accept less than a Colombian domestic worker (who although by law they should receive around 70000 Colombian pesos per day often get paid 25000 to 30000 or $6.25 to $7.5) can be sacked in favour of other migrants earning 10000 to 15000 pesos ($2.5 to $3.75). Competition and resentment between Venezuelan and Colombian workers extend beyond the legal labour market to the illicit economy. ELN guerrillas reportedly intervened in 2018 after locals in the hamlet of El Tarra sought to drive away Venezuelan coca leaf pickers and sex workers because of their alleged deleterious effect on wages. According to these reports the ELN ordered farm and brothel owners to pay Venezuelans and Colombians equally to quell local tensions. Most coca leaf pickers in the area are now Venezuelan.

E. Access to Health Care

The quest for health care is one of the main causes of migration from Venezuela where the national public health system has broken down and many hospitals lack clean water and essential medication. Expensive medicines can be obtained privately but the prices (generally set in U.S. dollars) are unaffordable for most people. Many health care workers have also migrated causing shortages of essential medical staff. Because migrants have the right to emergency treatment in Colombia irrespective of immigration status women cross the border in search of prenatal checkups. Babies of Venezuelan parents born in Colombia since 19 August 2015 are now granted Colombian citizenship a measure in force until 2023. About 66000 babies and children have benefited.

Undocumented [Venezuelan] citizens with chronic diseases cancer or in need of antiretroviral drugs are often excluded from free treatment.

But the struggling Colombian health care system is limited in what it can deliver. Colombians themselves find it hard to gain access to decent health care while for Venezuelans matters are even worse. The state is responsible for paying hospitals for any costs related to emergency care for migrants. Since the payouts can be very slow hospitals feel little inclination to attend to undocumented Venezuelans and when they do prefer to charge them directly. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic irrespective of whether they had residency permits or not Venezuelans with the virus could not get medical care or were retained in hospitals by private security until reaching agreement on payment. One human rights defender in Bogotá referred to a case in which women prostituted themselves near a hospital until they could pay their medical bills. Venezuelans without legal residency can also be denied the right to medical attention if the hospital deems their cases not to be emergencies; undocumented citizens with chronic diseases cancer or in need of antiretroviral drugs are often excluded from free treatment. For those Venezuelans with formal residency the problems faced in gaining access to health care are typical of the travails of many Colombians. The Colombian government hopes to affiliate 945000 Venezuelans to the public health system but by December 2021 only 427000 had health insurance. Migrants with residency papers can acquire a public health insurance policy for low-income households but members of a focus group complained that the doctors they were allocated make prescriptions without a proper consultation (they noted painkillers in particular) while some have stopped visiting Colombian hospitals after receiving inadequate attention.

III. The Lure of Crime

Venezuelans are vulnerable to armed group recruitment and face extraordinary risks on Colombian territory. They are often unprotected thanks to their undocumented status unfamiliar with Colombian legislation and the rights it affords and ignorant of unwritten rules in conflict zones such as curfews and codes of conduct imposed by armed groups. In Bogotá’s rougher areas and other urban centres penniless migrants become caught up in gang violence contract killing and drug trafficking among other things. Outside the cities they are drawn into coca cultivation illegal mining and other illicit activity.

A. Venezuelans and Colombian Armed Groups

Despite the 2016 peace accord with the FARC armed conflict continues to impinge on the lives of millions of Colombians and in some areas has worsened in recent years. According to Colombia’s transitional justice system 2021 turned out to be the most violent year since the peace agreement was signed with competition intensifying among rival armed bands over illicit economies and trafficking routes that require control over land and communities. Unlike the Colombians who have experienced recurrent waves of fighting sometimes over decades the Venezuelans who find themselves in rural areas do not know the de facto rules of the road in zones disputed by armed groups. They consequently face risks that range from detonating landmines on rural tracks and braving crossfire in border areas to breaking nightly curfews imposed by armed groups. Women children undocumented migrants and refugees can face grave peril in these settings. Two Venezuelan boys were killed by FARC dissidents in the border town of Tibú in October 2021 after being suspected of shoplifting. Their bodies found on a village road bore signs with “thief” written on them. In the Colombian province of Cauca hundreds of Venezuelans were coerced into leaving a coca-growing region late in 2020 after a pamphlet signed by the ELN ordered them out. “A share of the migrant population is a victim of the armed conflict in Colombia” said one young Venezuelan migrant working on a coca plantation. Lacking resources and often without a residency permit or temporary protection status in Colombia Venezuelan migrants have also become prime targets for armed group recruitment – often more so than poor young Colombians. Forced recruitment of both Colombian nationals and Venezuelan migrants has been on the increase since 2017 and rose notably after the COVID-19 pandemic started. Armed groups’ thirst for territorial expansion and increased revenues has driven the quest to absorb more personnel. “Men and numbers give military power” one state official observed. With no place to stay and little money to pay for food and accommodation Venezuelans en route are easy prey as they walk from town to town. The ELN for example is reported to have a makeshift lodge in the border department of Arauca where migrants can get clean clothing rest and something to eat for a few days while being enticed to join the group. Armed groups “show they are different to the government which does not lend a hand” an expert in child recruitment said. Even though guerrilla outfits such as the ELN do not pay their soldiers a salary fake offers are made to recruit Venezuelans or gifts are distributed such as cell phones or even motorbikes. In Arauca one of its traditional bastions the guerrilla group allegedly pays one-off signup fees of between 200000 and 500000 Colombian pesos ($50 to $125).

Migrants are lured with gifts or recruited under threat particularly in conflict-ridden provinces.

Recruitment of migrants sometimes by force occurs both along the border and in areas throughout the country. Venezuelans who work for armed groups are found in regions far from the customary migration routes for example in the Chocó department on Colombia’s Pacific coast. Migrants are lured with gifts or recruited under threat particularly in conflict-ridden provinces such as Nariño Norte de Santander Arauca Cauca and Putumayo. Cases of online recruitment have also come to light. Youngsters in Venezuela have been tricked by job offers on social media and invited to the cities of Arauca and Cúcuta whence they were subsequently taken to rural areas by an unidentified armed group. Once in these groups Venezuelans find escaping a perilous enterprise. Venezuelans who manage to desert lack information about their rights where they can go and the risks they face. One 24-year-old Venezuelan interviewed by Crisis Group in a police cell was recruited at gunpoint in Bajo Cauca by the Caparros a criminal outfit that sprung from former paramilitary forces. The group promised him monthly pay of 800000 Colombian pesos ($200) and a permit to visit his family after eight months. He received a haircut shave uniform and M79 grenade launcher and was immediately sent into a conflict area without any training. Induction into the Caparros proved hellish. Over seven months he endured humiliation and regular beatings. He did not receive the promised payment and lived through skirmishes in which he lost a Venezuelan friend. “It was either continuing or dying” he said. “I decided to continue to find a way out”. After deserting he helped the army to find hidden weapons but was subsequently arrested himself for firearm possession and has since spent 21 months in jail. The indifference of state and security officials toward the particular needs of Venezuelans embroiled in Colombia’s armed conflicts is a recurrent concern. Migration experts told Crisis Group that it is common for law enforcement agencies to prosecute both Venezuelans and Colombians on the basis of ordinary criminal law for belonging to armed groups even if they desert after being forcibly recruited. Desertion thus spells double jeopardy for migrants who also face violent repercussions if armed groups believe they are sharing information with the authorities. The costs of reporting crimes frequently outweigh the benefits. In 2019 a 14-year-old Venezuelan girl who escaped in Norte de Santander after being recruited by the Popular Liberation Army an armed group dedicated largely to drug trafficking was handed by judicial authorities to a foster home in the same department run by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare. Armed men subsequently found her and killed her. Some armed group members complain about rapid growth through the absorption of Venezuelans though such grumbling is not the norm. One ELN militant griped that migrants had been used to collect extortion fees or intimidate locals without first being provided with proper education and ideological training. In his view the migrants’ presence explained why locals in certain regions under ELN control were displaying much more aversion to the group than before. “They are not making a good entry into communities and are using very top-down approaches” he said. But in general the armed groups see value in recruiting Venezuelans. “It’s better to work with any immigrant. It’s cheaper they do what’s required and they don’t get as much jail time as [a Colombian]” said a Colombian gang leader in Bogotá.

B. Criminal Groups and Urban Gangs

Venezuelans are easily assimilated into Colombian gangs due to their vulnerable position and immediate need to survive in competitive urban environments. The nature and extent of criminal involvement by recruited Venezuelans varies. Certain organised crime groups such as those in Norte de Santander generally block them from acquiring status or ascending the ranks. Some migrants are drawn into specific tasks such as carrying drugs during their journeys. Venezuelans are reportedly given discounts on the price of informal transport over the border into Arauca department if they bring packages with unknown contents. In Norte de Santander some migrants are forced to carry packages containing drugs as gang members accompany them to check up on their cargo. In large cities criminal groups target Venezuelans who are homeless and living on the street many of them young men. “A gang gives work to a Venezuelan gives him shelter and food” a Venezuelan drug trafficker explained. The temporary accommodation used by Venezuelans in Bogotá or pagadiarios (discussed above) are one gateway to recruitment. Indebted migrants are induced to consume drugs creating a dependency relationship with criminal groups. Fake charities offer shelter but reportedly insert migrants in networks of sexual exploitation and micro-trafficking.

The chief of an enterprise of contract killers (known as 'sicarios') … mainly works with Venezuelans due to the lower costs. ‘A Colombian asks for 10 million pesos ($2500) to kill someone; a Venezuelan does it for two or three million ($500-750)’.

The chief of an enterprise of contract killers (known as sicarios) in Colombia explained that he now mainly works with Venezuelans due to the lower costs. “A Colombian asks for 10 million pesos ($2500) to kill someone; a Venezuelan does it for two or three million ($500-750)”. According to a Venezuelan member of one criminal group recruits start by carrying out a murder for which they are paid between 1000000 to 5000000 Colombian pesos ($250 to $1250). Depending on the victim’s profile the killer may or may not briefly go back to Venezuela to avoid a police investigation. After between five and ten such hits a sicario can be killed to prevent him or her from acquiring power or status within the group. Trust issues with recruited migrants are usually resolved with violence. “They are killed at once” the leader of the enterprise of contract killers explained. “You get them out of the way. … They are disposable. [Venezuelans] can be removed and they can be replaced”. Colombian gangs also hire Venezuelans as dealers and street fighters. Smaller Colombian gangs use Venezuelans as lookouts or to sell drugs in Cúcuta. In Bogotá Venezuelans have not replaced Colombian street dealers often called jibaros so much as enabled the latter to gain turf and boost revenues by deploying a larger work force. Local gangs in Bogotá especially around Corabastos Colombia’s biggest marketplace for fresh produce – and a hotbed for drug trafficking sexual exploitation and gun running – recruit Venezuelans as foot soldiers in their urban gang wars. Venezuelans hawking drugs on street corners often get killed by competing gangs end up in shootouts for neighbourhood control or are killed in internal struggles. Most of the murders of Venezuelans in Bogotá have taken place in this part of the capital.

A social worker explained that Bogotá’s gangs use migrants and refugees as ‘cannon fodder’.

A social worker explained that Bogotá’s gangs use migrants and refugees as “cannon fodder” – a trend that is reflected in the rising number of Venezuelans killed in the capital. The number murdered each year has jumped from one in 2016 to 72 in 2019 and 109 in 2021 – meaning the proportion of murder victims that is Venezuelan is higher than the percentage of Venezuelans in the city’s population (see graph 1 in Appendix B). “They are pawns that gangs use to have more power and displace the competition” a state official said. Reports and rumours regarding the expansion of large Venezuelan criminal groups into Colombia and beyond have proliferated in recent years. But evidence from insiders and eyewitnesses suggests that the presence in Colombia of Venezuelan criminal groups is less prominent than often claimed. “No Venezuelan gang comes to Colombia to build an empire here” a Venezuelan organised crime member said. According to a state official if Venezuelan gangs tried to move into the territory occupied by Colombian organised crime a turf war would most likely erupt. Most of the major crime groups competing for control in Bogotá especially in the districts of Kennedy and Bosa are not Venezuelan in origin although these groups do recruit migrants. Even so smaller criminal startups founded by Venezuelan migrants are active in certain urban areas. A group of Venezuelans called Los Maracuchos operates in María Paz in the Bogotá’s Kennedy district where it is known for its extremely violent behaviour and involvement in street robberies. A gang leader in Bogotá complained about Venezuelans trying to make a move. “They are a plague and they are bad” he said. Large Venezuela-based crime syndicates called megabandas have expanded in recent years and forged supply chain relations across the border. The Tren de Aragua is one of the most notorious megabandas and its influence is said to extend across Latin America but some reports of its presence in Colombia might be based on the work of impostors. “There are many who say they are the Tren de Aragua but they are not they use the name to intimidate people” a Venezuelan criminal operative said. Still the group does have some operations in Colombia. For example Crisis Group was able to confirm the presence of the Tren de Aragua in the Villa de Rosario municipality on the border with Venezuela where the group started working in 2018. During the pandemic the Tren de Aragua continued to operate in the department of Norte de Santander with the approval of larger Colombian armed groups above all the Gulf Clan with whom it collaborates but it has faced armed resistance from the ELN. The Tren de Aragua traffics drugs and humans and extorts migrants wishing to cross the border illegally. National media and law enforcement officials argue that the Tren de Aragua has taken over drug sales in large parts of Bogotá and allege they are responsible for a series of brutal killings. Even so various sources in the state and in organised crime concur that the Tren de Aragua’s presence in the capital and other major cities goes no further than small cells working alongside local illegal outfits.

C. Coca Cultivation

A large number of Venezuelans find their way – whether of their own free will or under coercion – to rural areas remote from the standard migration routes. Hoping to avoid tough competition for informal employment in urban settings particularly during the pandemic-related lockdowns they are often following invitations from family members or acquaintances. The opportunities they find are frequently illicit and include work on coca plantations and logging in environmentally protected areas. “Venturing to a city to look for work is impossible in Colombia because there are two million Venezuelans” said a young migrant by way of explanation for his job at a coca plantation. He eventually used his earnings to move on to Chile. Illicit activities in Colombia’s remote rural areas offer dirt-poor migrants a chance to make ends meet. Work on the coca plantations provides quick pay and often includes food and board which to some doubtless seems preferable to the back-breaking chores for little money in nearby African oil palm plantations where work can include clearing overgrowth or carrying heavy palm fruit onto carts. Still conditions are also harsh on the coca plantations even when these offer a place to sleep and daily meals. “In Venezuela I never thought of a farm in such a deplorable state. There’s no electricity a very thin mattress that feels like a table. Conditions are worse than in Venezuela. The only difference is that in Venezuela we have nothing to eat but in Colombia we do” the migrant coca leaf picker said. Typically a coca leaf picker can earn between 30000 to 50000 Colombian pesos ($7.5 to $12.5) for a day’s work. A fast worker paid per quantity of coca leaves can earn over 100000 pesos ($25). Many migrants reach the coca plantations on their own initiative but some leaf pickers are also recruited in Venezuela in cities in Colombia and at informal border crossings. Some schools close to the border in Zulia state Venezuela have been abandoned during harvest periods as both students and teachers left for coca plantations on the other side of the border. Armed groups display contrasting attitudes to Venezuelans in coca plantations. ELN guerrillas forced crop owners and farmers to pay migrants properly in the southern part of Bolívar state. “If any person here is owed money on a farm do not hesitate to contact us” the guerrillas would tell migrant workers. But in another coca growing area Venezuelan pickers who did not like their work and opted to leave the plantations without asking permission were killed allegedly by local armed actors who mistrusted the migrants and thought they would share information with the authorities.

D. Gold Mining and Trafficking

Venezuelans with or without prior experience have also landed jobs in gold mining in Colombia where illegal mines are often financed by drug money. Migrants tend to reach remote mining areas on the basis of hearsay or invitations from fellow Venezuelans who previously worked in the mines. To gain work in a particular mine a migrant mostly requires a personal introduction. Women are also frequently employed recycling mine waste that still contains concentrations of gold. The pay for migrants who work in the gold mines tends to vary. Some Venezuelans working in a region controlled by paramilitary groups said they are paid about 40 per cent less than Colombians if they lack formal residency but at equal rates to Colombians if they have valid papers. In another area controlled by the ELN a woman who had trouble finding a job in Bogotá and proceeded to work in the sex industry in Antioquia told Crisis Group that she now earns a few hundred U.S. dollars a month in an illegal gold mine. She brought her sons over from Venezuela so they could also work in the mines.

Further down the supply chain migrants are also involved in trafficking gold from illegal Venezuelan mines into Colombia. They are used as cross-border smugglers and are called pulmones or lungs. Many smugglers carrying small amounts can end up accumulating significant quantities of gold for wholesale buyers on the Colombian side of the border which is called “smurfing”. “All this is squared with migration and police authorities” said a Venezuelan crime syndicate member. Cúcuta is a hub for gold smuggling and other contraband. A gram of gold without paperwork fetches close to $50 enabling large amounts of the metal to be gathered and sold quickly. Most pawn shops that work in this market buy oro de mina meaning unprocessed gold extracted straight from the Venezuelan mines. Buyers tend to bring gold from Cúcuta to cities such as Bogotá Cali or Medellín where the gold is smelted and exported with the help of false documents.

IV. Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation

Migrants and refugees have become a major focus for organised crime networks and young women in particular including minors are victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Criminal groups may recruit women and minors by offering them jobs in restaurants or hotels before forcing them into sexual exploitation and retaining their passports often saying they will divulge compromising pictures to family members to secure compliance. They may also threaten to kidnap women’s children. Under pressure victims may eventually become recruiters themselves trying to lure in other women.

Some Venezuelan women are forced into sex work after arriving in Colombia often winding up in clandestine brothels where they are exploited and abused.

Recruitment occurs in Venezuela on the border and in Colombia’s interior. Alongside the Simón Bolívar bridge (which is traditionally the busiest border crossing) in an area called La Parada some Venezuelan women are forced into sex work after arriving in Colombia often winding up in clandestine brothels where they are exploited and abused. One of the criminal groups active in La Parada the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua allegedly recruits and sells women to other illegal outfits. One migrant mentioned a house inhabited by about 25 women including five minors who had been marked behind their ears to prove “ownership”. To prevent the women from escaping the criminals threaten them with violence. Sexually exploited women in border areas are often tricked or forced into going to rural areas where they are put at the service of members of armed groups. A driver who frequently takes Venezuelan women and girls to Catatumbo a coca-growing epicentre explained that the women hope to work a weekend and earn good money but brothel owners sometimes coerce them into staying for as long as a month. Local armed groups approved these arrangements after negotiating with brothel owners. Young women and girls – sometimes underage – are also escorted to rural areas to be wed in servile marriages to coca growers with some men ostensibly “buying” them from armed groups or human traffickers. Women and girls are abused and beaten if they are caught attempting to escape. Local authorities allegedly do not act even when they harbour suspicions about landowners engaging in child marriage. There are also reports of armed group members harassing sexually abusing and murdering migrant women. In Antioquia female sex workers explained how one of their friends was killed and buried in a hamlet after armed groups discovered she was carrying HIV. Armed groups are also known to expel sex workers from the area they control if they test positive for sexually transmitted diseases. Some migrant women are also recruited for webcam work; although considered safer due to the absence of physical contact advocates note that it also is exploitative and can incur serious risks for those involved. Through force or deception young women including minors end up being compelled to meet and sleep with clients with Medellín’s tourist areas notorious as hubs of sexual exploitation. Again one method of strongarming girls and women into complying is the threat of sending compromising videos and pictures to family members who have been located on social media. Some of the girls and women have their identity documents retained and need to work 24-hour shifts. To the extent that the foregoing activities involve human trafficking Colombia has certain legal mechanisms to protect survivors. It has ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime which includes an anti-trafficking protocol. In a landmark October 2021 ruling Colombia’s Constitutional Court ordered the state to create new regulations for the identification and protection of trafficking victims and highlighted the vulnerable position of migrant women and the need for special protection. Impunity for these crimes however remains the norm. Out of 908 reported cases of human trafficking between 2011 and 2016 only 52 ended in convictions while state authorities have so far shown little inclination or capacity to protect vulnerable women and girls from being trafficked and exploited. Despite the fact that sex work is legal in Colombia officials reportedly often discriminate against Venezuelans engaged in prostitution and violate their rights rather than treating them as potential victims of exploitation. In some cases state and law enforcement officials have been found complicit in sexual exploitation of trafficking victims. A lawyer explained that police officers have collaborated with human traffickers pointing to cases where they sent Venezuelan women and children back to their captors often family members of the victims. Four police officials working in Cúcuta were arrested in 2019 for participating in a human trafficking network. A social worker in Bogotá cited another case involving police officers who allegedly returned a Venezuelan woman to her pimp after she had escaped his clutches. “They put her in a patrol car and brought her back to the brothel. This was done by the same police officials who patrol the area”.

V. The Backlash against Venezuelans

Against the backdrop of waves of protest and surging political tensions Venezuelans living in Colombia have been widely stigmatised for the involvement of some migrants in crime and scapegoated for rising levels of poverty and unemployment.

A. Public Perceptions

Public perceptions of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia have grown notably more hostile in the past three years. Before May 2019 most Colombians believed that it was right to receive Venezuelan migrants but a minority now holds this viewpoint with only 40 per cent of Colombians saying they support residency rights for Venezuelan migrants. Surveys showed that over 80 per cent held unfavourable opinions of the migrants by the start of the pandemic although the percentage of detractors has fallen slightly since then.

Social media is frequently a platform for the vitriol directed toward Venezuelans with migrants blamed for stirring up protests making streets unsafe and competing for benefits.

Social media is frequently a platform for the vitriol directed toward Venezuelans with migrants blamed for stirring up protests making streets unsafe and competing for benefits from underfunded social programs. When Colombian media outlets or government officials suggest that a Venezuelan has been involved in a prominent crime the number of xenophobic posts on social media reportedly increases. For example such postings spiked when Bogotá’s centre-left mayor Claudia López blamed migrants for episodes of criminal violence in the city saying: “Whoever comes to work is welcome but whoever comes to commit a crime should be deported immediately”. The day after López’s remarks anti-migrant messages increased by 83 per cent according to one tracker. Hate messages toward migrants also proliferated when the protection statute for Venezuelans was announced in February 2021 with false information spread via social media about migrants becoming eligible to vote in Colombia. Daily face-to-face contact with migrants tends to reduce xenophobia but opportunities for those interactions diminished during the pandemic and its associated lockdowns which in Colombia tended to be strict and long. Some local academics suggested that the lockdowns increased the extent to which Colombians formed opinions about the activities of migrants primarily through negative messaging on social media.

B. Stigma and Vulnerability

As discussed above Venezuelan migrants are often drawn into the ranks of organised crime which has exploited migrants’ acute economic need to boost their profits. The precise extent of Venezuelans’ contribution to crime rates is difficult to measure. Quantitative studies differ as to whether they now commit more crimes per head than Colombian nationals. Several studies indicate that Venezuelans are involved in fewer offences. Data shows that Venezuelans have lower arrest rates than Colombians when it comes to violent crime but slightly higher rates relative to the population when minor infractions are considered. That said the proportion of convictions received by Venezuelans now slightly exceeds their share of the population in Colombia (see graph 2 in Appendix B). Meanwhile 2439 Venezuelans are in jail on criminal charges representing about 2.5 per cent of a national headcount of prisoners that stands at 96962. While this percentage is significantly lower than their share of the country’s population the number of Venezuelan inmates has risen much faster than the number of Colombian prisoners.

The conspicuous role played by Venezuelans in carrying out street crime for Colombian groups leads the entire community to be stigmatised and treated with suspicion.

By contrast data from Bogotá indicates that Venezuelans are arrested in the capital for high-visibility crimes such as burglary theft and drug sales at far higher rates than their share of the population and at a slightly higher rate for murder. Migrants say the conspicuous role played by Venezuelans in carrying out street crime for Colombian groups leads the entire community to be stigmatised and treated with suspicion. Migrants above all in the capital report being subjected to regular abuse by police officers who beat them and destroy their identity documents. These incidents are said to occur above all in the early morning hours and on Sundays when Bogotá is quieter. Bogotá mayor Claudia López has contributed to this stigmatisation stating that “we have very violent Venezuelan immigrants here. … They murder first and then they steal”. She also made remarks in which she claimed that “Venezuelans mak[e] life difficult” for citizens in the capital city which a chamber of the Constitutional Court ordered her to retract. Whether Venezuelans are responsible for an increasing share of crime in Colombia or not they are without doubt becoming exposed to higher levels of lethal violence as they are being used as disposable fighters by rural armed groups and recruited for high-exposure jobs in the urban underworld. A total of 1933 Venezuelans were killed across the country between 2015 and 2020. The murder rate of Venezuelans has risen sharply and is now far in excess of that for Colombians – reaching close to twice the national average in 2021 (see graph 3 in Appendix B).

C. Deportation

Colombian authorities have turned increasingly to deportation in response to the difficulties in imprisoning undocumented migrants as well as the problems in verifying the identity of detained suspects – the effect of severed diplomatic and consular relations between Colombia and Venezuela. Colombian criminal outfits have even taken advantage of these deportation practices by recruiting Venezuelans knowing that they are less likely to be put in jail. “The worst thing that can happen is that they send him back to his country again” a gang leader who employs Venezuelans explained. From 2015 to 2021 Colombia deported over 4000 Venezuelans (see graph 4 in Appendix B). Senior officials have sought to justify waves of deportations by arguing that Venezuelans represented a threat to national security during nationwide protests in 2019 and 2021 as well as during the eruption of unrest in Bogotá in September 2020. During the protests in 2019 authorities put 59 Venezuelans on an airplane heading to Puerto Inírida on the Colombian side of the border in the Amazon where locals blocked the airstrip to prevent the Venezuelans from being released in their vicinity. After the plane finally landed in nearby Puerto Carreño in Colombia the deportees were taken to the Venezuelan bank of the Orinoco river and dropped in a remote area frequented by armed groups without ever being officially handed over to Venezuelan authorities. Bogotá’s messages about Venezuelan involvement in the 2021 protest wave were especially pointed. “The information that intelligence has indicates that there is a strong presence of Venezuelans at some roadblocks” said Defence Minister Diego Molano in May 2021 at the height of the national strike. Government officials went so far as to spread claims that the Maduro government and drug traffickers had a role in organising protests. (The Maduro government has denied involvement. ) Subsequently hundreds of Venezuelans were rounded up and deported without substantial evidence being amassed against them.

VI. Recommendations

Migrants and refugees who left Venezuela during the first years of the country’s political conflict had high hopes for change in their home country and for a return in the near future. Despite signs of fragile economic stabilisation in Venezuela a true recovery is likely to depend on political agreements between the Maduro government and the opposition followed by the relaxation and lifting of U.S. sanctions – none of which appears to be in the offing. In all likelihood a large number of Venezuelans in Colombia are there to stay. A recent survey by the Bogotá city government found that 88 per cent of migrants wished to remain in the country. It will be incumbent on the new administration and its international partners to act accordingly.

A. Protection

Providing Venezuelan migrants with information and support they need to protect themselves as soon as possible after they arrive in Colombia can help prevent them from wandering into problems. Right now both are in short supply. For example migrants and refugees who cross the Simón Bolívar bridge – east of Cúcuta – encounter criminal networks in the small town on the Colombian side. These groups try to extort recruit or profit from the Venezuelans. By contrast to gain access to Colombia’s state services migrants first need to reach Cúcuta and navigate a complicated bureaucratic system. Until they obtain legal stay permits they are not allowed into buses that can take them to their destinations or next transit points condemning them to walk across Colombia with all the attendant risks. The ones who reach Bogotá sometimes after walking more than 500km have little idea where to look for jobs shelter or any sort of support and are easy pickings for the grey market and organised crime. Illegal and informal businesses that involve sexual exploitation and micro-trafficking offer immediate economic relief and these easily accessible but poorly paid jobs are attractive when there are no other options for making ends meet. Authorities at every level of government should be equipped to receive Venezuelan migrants and steer them toward safe productive activities. Resource constraints will pose challenges to this effort. After decades of conflict Colombia has more than five million internally displaced people and the addition of nearly 2.5 million Venezuelan migrants is taxing it yet further. Still improved collaboration among the relevant state agencies should be possible and could improve matters significantly. In particular migration and law enforcement authorities should cooperate better with municipal authorities child protection services and the office of the human rights ombudsman. They should work with large cities to provide resources and personnel for receiving migrants and refugees at known entry points. A prime objective of greater cooperation should be to ensure that arriving Venezuelans receive timely clear useful information about hotspots for trafficking forced recruitment and sexual exploitation as well as where to turn for help – including how to get government and UN programs and benefits.

Colombian authorities should ... take greater steps to protect trafficking victims and survivors of sexual exploitation ... along migratory routes.

Colombian authorities should also take greater steps to protect trafficking victims and survivors of sexual exploitation – as well as potential victims – along migratory routes. Protected environments are vital to prevent women from being exploited and trafficked especially on the border; they should also afford women and children who have already become victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation an opportunity to escape from their abusers as well as medical and psychological support. There are about two dozen safe houses in Bogotá but in the main border city of Cúcuta the lack of safe spaces for women and minors is pronounced. Colombia’s police should also designate a unit to investigate and prosecute human trafficking which could work in close collaboration with judicial systems in other Latin American states while pursuing internal investigations to tackle the alleged complicity of police officers in trafficking networks. Another protective step that Colombian authorities can take would be to recognise those Venezuelan nationals who have become victims of Colombia’s internal conflict as such for purposes of Colombia’s 2011 Victims Law. That law stipulates that all people who suffer from violations of international humanitarian or human rights law amid Colombia’s armed conflict are legally entitled to special rights including reparations as well as certain social and economic benefits. But Venezuelans are excluded from the National Victims Unit’s register and are not eligible for reparations payments even if they otherwise satisfy the law’s requirements. Although the Victims Law does not discriminate based on nationality or migratory status as a practical matter the Unit for Comprehensive Care and Reparation for Victims does not carry out assessments of undocumented citizens. There are many other hurdles to overcome before Venezuelans can be recognised as conflict victims as well. Colombia is not alone in facing the challenge of protecting and integrating Venezuelan migrants; all the Andean countries are struggling with it in the face of growing domestic intolerance and xenophobia. Left-leaning Chilean President Gabriel Boric declared at the Summit of the Americas in June that “no country can absorb [Venezuelan migration] by itself” insisting on the need for a regional response anchored in human rights. The core components of such a response should include greater information sharing regarding migration flows the presence of organised criminal groups and other security risks faced by migrants; cross-border initiatives to ensure safe passage with common rules as to valid documentation; and a broad agreement to recognise Venezuelans’ qualifications. This program should draw on backing from international donors and agencies and should focus on helping protect Venezuelan migrants from the risks of violence and exploitation they encounter. Attracting support could be difficult however. Foreign assistance for Venezuelan migrants has previously paled in comparison to support for other humanitarian emergencies and is likely to decline further in 2022 as donors shift budgets to the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile aid packages reserved for Colombia are turning their focus to victims of the country’s worsening internal conflicts.

B. Integration

While migration can be beneficial for host countries these benefits may be overshadowed by the challenges of absorbing a wave of new entrants into a labour market characterised by high levels of unemployment and informality and low levels of pay. Since it is likely that many Venezuelans will not return to their homeland developing routes to formal employment will be essential to ensure that migrants are not marooned in informal jobs or vulnerable to recruitment by criminal groups. In spite of the state’s steps toward legalising the stay of migrants providing them with access to health care and beginning to validate diplomas earned in Venezuela employers are still hesitant to formally hire or enter into contracts with Venezuelans. Additionally many of the more predatory employers instead exploit their vulnerable status through informal arrangements. Meanwhile the gut fear of many Colombians especially those earning lower incomes is that Venezuelans will steal their jobs. Government leaders sometime reinforce these anxieties. The outgoing vice president Marta Lucía Ramírez stated in February that Colombia has taken in the “less wealthy and qualified sectors” of the Venezuelan diaspora and has not benefited from the skills and resources typical of the migrants reaching North America and Europe. In fact Venezuelan migrants are not necessarily less qualified than Colombians but they have struggled to get their qualifications recognised. About 69 per cent of Venezuelans in Colombia possess at least a high school diploma roughly 9 per cent higher than the rate for Colombia’s population. Due to a lack of funds and government programs stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic however Colombia has been slow in moving ahead with efforts to integrate Venezuelans after granting legal stay permits. Like other regional states it has lagged with respect to the recognition of educational credentials. Only about 10 per cent of the Venezuelans in Chile Colombia and Peru had their diplomas and credentials recognised by October 2020. By March 2022 about 22000 Venezuelans in Colombia had completed the first steps to validate their university degrees.

Colombia [and] other Latin American states should make the recognition of credentials quicker and cheaper while also helping migrants and refugees gain access to courses and re-schooling.

With the support of multilateral bodies such as the UN Development Programme and World Bank Colombia as well as other Latin American states should make the recognition of credentials quicker and cheaper while also helping migrants and refugees gain access to courses and re-schooling which are essential to bridge the gap between supply and demand in the labour market. In addition the state should put more effort into communicating the legal rights of migrants to the private sector. Even though stay permits allow Venezuelans to open bank accounts and access credit bank employees often deny these because of distrust or a lack of knowledge. As for the large population of migrants and refugees who do not possess valid migratory status above all those living in remote rural areas the risks of exploitation in the labour market are high. Barriers to obtaining status can be significant. Migration offices are located in larger cities that for Venezuelans for example in the remote border region of Catatumbo are too costly or far away to reach. Mobile units carrying migration officials and training for municipal officials to work on migratory issues such as handling applications for stay permits could help improve access to formal work and social services for migrants in areas prone to conflict and crime. At the same time authorities should do what they can to overcome at least some of the concerns that Colombians have about competing with Venezuelans in the labour market. A stricter law enforcement approach to businesses that illegally exploit Venezuelans could help assure Colombians that migrants are not undermining employee protection laws including those requiring payment of at least the official minimum wage. Steps to increase trade between the two countries could also enhance the perceived value of Venezuelans to the Colombian economy enabling them to take commercial advantage of their connections across the border in ways that could create jobs for Colombians rather than take them away.

C. Bilateral Diplomacy

Diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela have been frozen since 23 February 2019 when President Maduro cut ties with Bogotá after opposition leader Juan Guaidó spearheaded a Colombia-U.S.-backed plan to transport humanitarian aid across the border. As a result each country closed the other’s embassies and consulates. The border closure forced tens of thousands of migrants refugees and residents to take enormous risks at dangerous informal crossings under the control of armed and criminal groups. Since the closing of embassies and consulates the only consular services that Venezuelans have access to in Colombia have been provided by Guaidó’s “interim government”. Fewer than ten countries now recognise his claim to the presidency following the failure of the various schemes in 2019 and 2020 to unseat Maduro. A marked deterioration in bilateral relations has been felt most acutely at the border above all in worsening insecurity. At the same time acrimonious or even severed relations between the countries need not impede functioning border ties. Maduro’s predecessor as president the late Hugo Chavéz and his Colombian counterpart Álvaro Uribe president between 2002 and 2010 had a plainly adversarial relationship but the two maintained open borders and commercial relations for several years before diplomatic frictions between 2007 and 2009 led to border closures. Maduro and former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos met in Ecuador in 2015 to discuss their border dispute at length. Yet there is as yet no official record of even as much as a telephone call between Maduro and Duque. Even so conditions at the border for migrants and refugees as well as daily traffic between the two countries have started to improve. Since October 2021 the Venezuelan-Colombian border has been partially reopened again for pedestrians. Fluid dialogue between senior officials in the neighbouring regions of Norte de Santander in Colombia and Táchira in Venezuela has ensured an increasing level of local cooperation regarding shared security threats and humanitarian relief for migrants. In 2021 authorities in Táchira warned their Colombian counterparts that members of the Tren de Aragua had escaped from prison and were hiding in Colombia. The exchange of intelligence led to their arrest.

[Colombian President] Petro declared that he would open the border [with Venezuela] fully and work toward improving human rights along the frontier.

The incoming government in Bogotá which took power on 7 August appears determined to build on this fragile progress and restore ties between the two nations completely. President Petro a left-leaning former urban guerrilla who has pledged to fight inequality and reduce Colombia’s reliance on fossil fuels has said he would re-establish diplomatic relations with Venezuela “whatever the government”. Following his first telephone call with Maduro days after his election victory Petro declared that he would open the border fully and work toward improving human rights along the frontier potentially signifying an end to the mistrust and mutual accusations of support for armed factions that have marred bilateral relations since 2019. The government is also likely to be keen to expand trade following the collapse in formal commercial relations over the past decade and to find ways to handle more humanely the arrival and return of migrants. On the specific issue of migration Petro has made explicit his goal of improving the well-being of Venezuelans. Building on the efforts of previous governments to offer Venezuelans temporary residency his manifesto states that his government would support migrants’ economic integration and educational programs as well as “dignified conditions for return to their countries of origin”. He has also said he would promote dialogue with other Latin American states to support the integration of migrants and recognise their contribution to host societies. Despite the new government’s concern for migrants’ needs political refugees from Venezuela in Colombia have voiced concern about whether renewed bilateral relations will compromise their safety by enabling extradition back to Venezuela.

D. Resolving the Venezuelan Crisis

Venezuela’s economic political humanitarian and security woes have driven the migrant exodus. But while fixing some of these underlying causes could create the conditions for more migrants to return a solution to Venezuela’s political crisis that could spark a steady economic recovery nevertheless appears far from imminent. Tentative negotiations between the Maduro government and an opposition alliance in Mexico started in August 2021 but Maduro suspended them two months later. In March 2022 however the push for a negotiated settlement in Venezuela received a fresh boost when Maduro announced he would resume talks with the opposition after a high-level U.S. delegation visited Caracas. Unfortunately progress toward a new round of dialogue has stumbled since then though it is not off the table with frequent contacts between representatives of the two sides in recent months. The resumption of talks between Caracas and Washington was profoundly influenced by the war in Ukraine but could in theory generate a climate that is favourable not just to resuming oil exports to the U.S. market but also restarting the Mexico dialogue preparing the ground for improved electoral conditions and providing sanctions relief. There is no quick fix for a political conflict that has dragged on for over two decades but in the event of breakthrough toward a political settlement or a hypothetical lifting of U.S. sanctions living standards in Venezuela could finally embark on a sustained recovery from their current nadir while migrants might consider returning home. Down the road returnees could play a major role in the reconstruction of Venezuela. Yet it is uncertain how many of the Venezuelans who fled their homeland would consider going back when the situation allows for it. Estimates vary greatly but civil society groups argue that most Venezuelan migrants and refugees plan on staying in neighbouring host countries.

[Venezuelan President] Maduro has argued that Venezuelans who are facing discrimination and xenophobia abroad need a helping hand to return home.

In the meantime Maduro has argued that Venezuelans who are facing discrimination and xenophobia abroad need a helping hand to return home. “The doors of our country are open and they can return and be in peace without discrimination next to their families and on their land” he has declared. A campaign to support returnees branded Plan Vuelta a la Patria claims to have brought back over 28000 Venezuelans from 21 countries in 165 flights and sea journeys since 2018. This figure represents not even 0.5 per cent of the total Venezuelan diaspora but the chavista government has given its campaign a high profile. While the campaign was supposedly designed for stricken migrants who could not finance a return trip Venezuelans complained about having been charged large sums for their repatriation flights. Critics have treated the strategy as a political stunt. Some entrepreneurial Venezuelans have also returned home many with the aim of profiting from the elimination of price controls and free circulation of the U.S. dollar in the country. To promote future safe returns the Venezuelan government should not be in sole charge of these operations. International partners should press Colombia and Venezuela to open effective humanitarian corridors across the border as part of any improvement in relations between the two with support from international agencies such as the International Organization for Migration and UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Guarantees aimed at safeguarding human rights of returnees during their journey will be vital. UN agencies and donor countries should also increase financial and technical support for returning migrants and strengthen the responsiveness of the Venezuelan state so as to ensure returnees have food and safe transportation to their destination. Special attention for women and children who have already faced extreme risks and hardships during their flight from Venezuela is of particular importance. Close monitoring of the entire return process is critical. Venezuelans who opted to return home during the early months of the pandemic were received in overcrowded quarantine centres on the Venezuelan side of the border where conditions were dire. Colectivos violent para-police groups loyal to chavista politicians were looking for signs of political dissent inside these centres and behaved violently toward former military officers who were perceived as traitors.

VII. Conclusion

Colombian authorities have provided a generous welcome to Venezuelans fleeing extreme hardship in their homeland setting a high bar for granting migrants formal residency and access to public services. But the migrants’ urgent quest for money food and shelter has tended to overshadow the scope of Bogotá’s legal protections. Many migrants have found themselves exposed to poverty discrimination and physical peril. Colombia’s large informal economy has failed to ease many migrants’ financial straits above all during the pandemic lockdowns. Meanwhile the country’s far-reaching armed and criminal networks have emerged as major employment providers but at the cost of sexually exploiting women entrapping migrants in conflict zones or dispatching them to commit crimes in cities. The xenophobic reaction of many Colombians to Venezuelans has spiked at moments of unrest but it owes much to the perception that migrants and refugees lower wages for locals and account for a rising share of crime above all high-visibility offences in big cities such as drug dealing and burglary. While debate continues as to the extent of their involvement in crime there is little doubt that vulnerable Venezuelans have been exploited as cheap docile labour by legal employers and crime groups alike. These employment terms and their effects on Colombians’ perceptions of migrants (informed by anxiety about competing with them) have in turn been aggravated by the country’s rising joblessness worsening insecurity buoyant illicit businesses and the pandemic’s economic effects.

A safer life for Venezuelans in Colombia will ... depend on improving ties between the two countries.

Ensuring that Venezuelans receive enhanced information and support to help protect them on arrival and doing more to enable them to join the formal economy would help rescue them from illicit recruitment and exploitation. But a safer life for Venezuelans in Colombia will also depend on improving ties between the two countries. Mending ruptured diplomatic and consular relations looks far more likely now that Gustavo Petro is the president of Colombia. Rebuilding relationships should be a priority for Caracas as well and the broader region should do more to pool efforts to address the exodus and the criminal threats migrants face. Recognising that Venezuelans will continue to cross into Colombia should not impede strategies to facilitate safe returns to Venezuela for those who wish especially if and when the country makes progress toward resolution of its longstanding political conflict. In the process both governments must collaborate to increase border security and make passage safer in both directions. Crime may well remain an alluring option for vulnerable migrants so long as Venezuela’s economy stays in the doldrums and employment in Colombia is hard to find. A route for migrants to a legal home and livelihood will require greater physical protection more economic opportunity and serious steps toward cooperation between the two states. Overall however the Petro administration’s advent and other developments hold out the hope that the worst of Venezuelan migrants’ travails in Colombia may be in the past.

America Movil’s shareholders have approved plans to create a new tower company Sitios Latinoamerica which will be listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. Certain assets liabilities and capital have reportedly been transferred to the new company. According to Reuters existing America Movil shareholders will receive one Sitios share for every 20 America Movil shares held.

The new company controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim has an inventory of 29090 towers. Just under 40% of these are in Brazil. The rest are in Argentina Chile Costa Rica Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua Panama Paraguay Peru Puerto Rico and Uruguay.

In a press release America Movil says: “Sitios Latam is a Mexican company independent from AMX’s management and capital structure. Its business focuses on the construction operation and marketing of towers and other structures for the installation of telecommunications equipment.”

The spinoff was approved last September by America Movil's shareholders. At that time we reported specialist website Tower Xchange’s assessment that Sitios Latinoamerica was set to become the world’s 10th largest towerco and the second largest in the region.

In a securities filing Amercia Movil has apparently said that Sitios Latam will continue to evaluate growth opportunities in the region.

It has struck tower-leasing deals with Vodafone and American Tower and plans to invest between €800 million ($826 billion) and €1 billion ($1 billion) in capital expenditure this year alone. Last year it spent just €290 million ($299 million).

What had not been confirmed were the names of product suppliers besides Rakuten Symphony but a few have just been outed by Tareq Amin Symphony's boss. Unsurprisingly they include some of the companies Rakuten has acquired and bundled into its Symphony offer. Others are third parties that Symphony as the effective systems integrator will need to coordinate.

Contributed by Symphony directly is Altiostar the developer of radio access network (RAN) software that Rakuten took full ownership of last year for an undisclosed fee. The cloud platform that hosts Altiostar as well as other software elements will come from Robin.io another company Rakuten has acquired.

""The cloud environment for the CU [central unit] DU [distributed unit] IMS [Internet Protocol multimedia subsystem] core packet core – anything and everything – is running on Robin.io"" said Amin. ""The entire cloud is our own private cloud.""

Amin's business is also providing the operational support systems and related apps from its Symworld store for accounting configuration fault management performance management and security.

As for external partners much of 1&1's spending will go on remote radio heads being supplied by NEC an electronics giant that figures prominently in Rakuten's own 5G rollout in Japan. Cisco another company Rakuten has used for its Japanese deployment is providing Internet Protocol transport technology said Amin. And Mavenir a US software developer is stumping up the core network products.

The latter choice is especially interesting because Mavenir competes directly against Altiostar in the market for RAN software. While the core is a separate domain a successful working relationship between Mavenir and Symphony would demonstrate to the industry that Rakuten is able to collaborate with sometime rivals in its systems integrator role.

Latency breakthrough



Amin and his colleagues were also able to share data from trials of fixed wireless access (FWA) services by 1&1 in Germany. Those delivered speeds of 1 Gbit/s and data transfers of more than 8 terabytes per customer over a 24-hour period.

But the real breakthrough as far as Amin is concerned was the latency of just 3 milliseconds (ms) a measure of the time it takes for a data signal to travel roundtrip on the network.

""Are we not all tired of talking about throughput as a key measure of 5G?"" Amin told Light Reading in response to a question about 1&1's strategy. ""The first accomplishment is to deliver 3-millisecond latency and to put a Minecraft application server the UPF [user plane function] CU DU and Robin.io all collocated in the same pod. This is just brilliant.""

The latency measurement is potentially important because some experts believe the roundtrip takes too long on existing mobile networks to support advanced applications such as virtual-reality gaming. In a blog published in February Dan Rabinovitsj the vice president of connectivity for metaverse-touting Facebook wrote that ""on a head-mounted mixed reality display where graphics will have to be rendered on screen in response to where someone is focusing their eyes things will need to move an order of magnitude faster – from single to low double digit ms."" Levels of between 75 and 150 milliseconds are good enough for today's latency-sensitive applications he said.

Reducing latency however is not just about having great software. Operators may have to install IT resources in more than just one or two data centers so they can shorten the physical distance a signal must travel to reach the customer. Not everyone would agree with Ralph Dommermuth United Internet's CEO that as many as 500 facilities will be needed for real-time applications in a country the size of Germany. But if he turns out to be right 1&1 could have a major advantage in the metaverse.

By Sean Wheatley

If you want a job done right you go to a professional — someone who specializes in the task and can make it a priority. Many of us do this when it comes to personal tasks such as oil changes home repairs and more. The same should be said when it comes to our water systems.

Water and wastewater privatization offers a solution for cities and municipalities looking to improve and maintain systems that help keep life flowing with safe clean reliable and affordable water. Similarly Utilities Privatization (“UP”) benefits military operations across the country — the Department of Defense established the UP program allowing utility experts to own and operate utility systems on base to help improve utility efficiency reliability and resiliency.

Traditionally we looked to government entities for the day-to-day operations maintenance and replacement of the water and wastewater systems on military bases on top of an extensive list of critical responsibilities. Working with partners like American Water’s Military Services Group through UP the government can be confident that water and wastewater utility system assets at our military installations are safe and compliant.

The Importance Of Water On Military Bases

It is crucial to understand how important water is to any military installation. You might not realize how much safe clean and reliable water impacts daily life on base as well as operations. Just like systems for any city or town an interruption in water supply means that people who live and work on base — servicemembers their families and a variety of civilian personnel — cannot drink wash their hands shower etc. But it also impacts daily operations and the overall mission. Many mission systems processes and equipment rely on reliable water and wastewater services. While the operating context is different this parallels the criticality of water and wastewater systems to safety wellbeing and sustainability for any community across the nation.

American Water’s Military Services Group Is A Force Multiplier

While the government works hard to help ensure the continued flow of quality water for military bases and their operations there are a few unavoidable uphill battles in the current water and wastewater management landscape — items that water companies are able to dedicate both high-quality and quantity of resources to help mitigate.

For many systems across the country including military installations water infrastructure is reaching the end of its useful life with some pipes nearing a century old. Maintenance is no longer enough — increased investment of capital and time is needed to help provide safe and reliable services today and into the future.

Organizations that can offer size and scale of operations is an absolute advantage. Experts in water management treatment supply chain security and event response are crucial. By bringing in an organization whose sole focus is the job at hand reduces the chance of necessary improvements being pushed down a list of priorities and also allows the government to focus on their core mission of national defense and security.

In the case of American Water’s Military Services Group we have been able to invest the time and financial resources needed to improve and properly maintain the water and wastewater systems at 17 bases across the country — soon to be 18 with the addition of Naval Station Mayport. With the weight and responsibility of how much life and protection this work entails the team has and continues to make strides in water treatment and distribution on these bases including expediting the ability to identify address and help resolve contaminants issues. In one particular case a project initiated to address a contaminant-related issue was resolved within 38 days. The team is also able to work closely with the U.S. EPA helping ensure that the same group working on the bases also has a seat at the table of the most important industry conversations. Overall our main goal is to help keep life flowing on base.

Impact On Local Communities

The benefits of UP extend beyond the systems. The well-being of the community around military bases also comes into play.

When it comes to operations with this type of guaranteed investment organizations such as American Water’s Military Services Group engage with multiple contractors — many of whom are based in surrounding communities resulting in a positive impact on the local economy. In addition within UP contracts there are requirements for how funding should be spent in particular when it comes to smaller traditionally disadvantaged businesses. Therefore with utilities privatization comes guaranteed engagement with (and therefore economic support for) women- veteran- and minority-owned businesses.

Additionally we continually identify ways to serve the base and local communities through donations and educational programs for children in school systems around our installations. We help teach the importance of water water conservation the environment and more.

American Water’s Military Services Group is proud to serve those who serve our country and do so safely.

Sean Wheatley currently serves as the Vice President of Operations for American Water’s Military Services Group. He has nearly 40 years’ experience in the water and wastewater industry including the role of Instructor at the U.S. Army Water Treatment School.

Seventeen-year-old Canadian indigenous rights activist and designated “water protector” Autumn Peltier is empowering young people to protect the environment. As the chief water commissioner for Anishinabek Nation she has spent nearly half her life speaking about the importance of clean water to organizations including the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.

Peltier who grew up in Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Ontario’s Manitoulin Island first became aware of the need for water advocacy at just eight years old. When visiting a neighboring indigenous community she discovered that they were unable to drink their tap water due to pollution. That kickstarted her career as an activist.

“I believe that no matter what race or color (or) how rich poor we are everybody deserves clean drinking water” she says. “You don’t have to be indigenous to respect (water) or raise awareness for it.”

At 12 years old Peltier made headlines for scolding Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau about his failure to enact policies that preserve clean water. Since then she has spoken to world leaders at the UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit. She was also nominated for the International Children’s Peace Prize three times.

“You wouldn’t generally think a kid or a young person would speak up about world issues or political issues” says Peltier. “That’s why it’s so much more powerful – because that’s how you know something is wrong.”

Watch the video above to find out how Peltier is elevating the central role of water in indigenous communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQuYmdvdi5jb20vbmV3cy9kZW1vY3JhdHMtYWdyaWN1bHR1cmUtZnVuZHMtc2V0LXVwLWNsaW1hdGUtZmlnaHQtb24tZmFybS1iaWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democrats' Agriculture Funds Set Up Climate Fight on Farm Bill | Bloomberg Government,"The $18.5 billion for “climate-smart” agriculture in Democrats’ landmark health-care and tax package was supposed to jump-start conservation programs ahead of next year’s farm bill.

Instead it’s setting up a spending battle that may keep money for similar programs from being included in normally bipartisan agriculture legislation. Rather than furthering Democrats’ goal of mitigating climate change the net effect of the higher spending could be to reduce the conservation focus in the 2023 farm bill.

The budget reconciliation measure (H.R. 5376) the Senate passed last weekend would provide additional money for the next four years of conservation agriculture programs including a popular one that helps farmers implement sustainable water and soil techniques.

The House is set to clear the legislation Friday and President Joe Biden said he’d sign it.

Such conservation programs typically garner bipartisan support when they’re reauthorized every five years in the farm bill. The key difference is Democrats’ explicit focus on climate change in the spending bill which targets agriculture’s emissions of two key contributors carbon and nitrous oxide. The Environmental Protection Agency estimated that over a tenth of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 came from agriculture.

Democrats and environmental lobbyists are banking on the additional spending paving the way for a more climate-focused farm bill next year. But a top Republican says the opposite could be true.

“If they go down this road we very well might be looking at reconciliation as the only way future farm bills get written” said Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry Committee lamenting the party-line changes to agriculture programs. “Whoever holds the pen wields the fate for vital programs that farmers ranchers and foresters depend on.”

Boozman could hold controlling influence over next year’s farm bill if Republicans flip the Senate in November’s midterm election. “We’ve always said — those of us who have worked on agriculture — you don’t reopen the farm bill and that’s exactly what they’re doing” he said adding that Democrats’ passage of their legislation would affect his approach to the 2023 version.

Conservation Versus Climate

The GOP traditionally supports conservation programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program that are largely focused on helping farmers safeguard their resources with methods like planting cover crops to improve soil health. The programs’ broader climate impacts have often been seen as a fringe benefit.

Many conservation programs implemented by the federal government “have co-benefits for environment and climate” even if they don’t explicitly target emissions in their authorizing language said Melissa Ho a senior vice president for freshwater and food at the World Wildlife Fund.

The programs help farmers and ranchers keep their land viable and “the long-term sustainability of the ranch and farm itself is to help ensure that there’s viability to produce food in the future in addition to meeting the needs and conservation goals” Ho said.

The party-line tax and climate package is meant to not only support more farmers getting conservation money — but also to draw a connection between conserving farming resources and fighting climate change.

The climate-focused conservation funding is a “win-win” for farmers and the environment Senate Agriculture Chair Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said in a fact sheet about the bill. Planting cover crops for instance traps nutrients in the soil reducing erosion and runoff while also improving crop output for farmers.

The reconciliation funding would help farmers become less reliant on nitrogen fertilizer for their crops said Ben Lilliston a director at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. Nitrogen fertilizer use is the biggest contributor to nitrous oxide emissions — which pose a threat to the ozone layer and trap heat in the atmosphere.

As the American West experiences its worst drought in more than 1200 years and raging wildfires devastate cropland Democratic lawmakers argue farmers aren’t just key for solving the climate crisis: they’re already being affected by it.

The reconciliation funding is a reflection of the key role conservation plays in mitigating climate change said Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) who sits on the agriculture committee.

“We’ll never be able to solve this issue that we’re facing without agriculture’s full participation” he added. “And I think over the years we’re going to see the farm bill become more and more committed to that in a bipartisan way.”

‘Delicate Balance’

Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) another committee member predicted “a vigorous debate” if lawmakers try to add specific climate-related conservation funding to the farm bill.

Sam Kieffer vice president of public policy at the American Farm Bureau Federation an agriculture lobbying group said Congress should instead “focus on policy that addresses high input costs and spurs economic growth.”

“We are concerned that negotiating farm policy as work begins on the bipartisan farm bill process could upend the delicate balance of what traditionally makes farm bills successful” Keiffer said in a statement.

Boozman took issue with how the climate and tax bill was crafted. While farm bills go through many rounds of hearings he said the party-line bill hasn’t had the same level of stakeholder input.

Further Boozman said the inclusion of agriculture funding in reconciliation “has changed the dynamic” of bipartisanship on the committee.

Underfunded Programs

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) a key voice on the agriculture committee also lamented the Democrats-only budget bill but said it was critical to have enough funding for conservation programs.

“We’re going to have to enhance these programs next year when we write the farm bill” he said.

And Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) disputed the idea that the reconciliation funding would affect how Republicans approach next year’s reauthorization. “There will be a balance and I’m hopeful we’ll advance even more so some of these key programs” he said.

The programs’ overwhelming popularity among farmers could also help bring Republicans on board. Lilliston pointed out that less than a third of applications for conservation programs are now granted and the Democrats’ money could allow more farmers to participate.

“The need for these conservation programs is clearly demonstrated by the sheer amount of demand for them even if we didn’t have a climate crisis to address” said Jesse Womack a conservation policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.

The reconciliation bill’s funding is intended to bolster the standard amounts provided in the farm bill for conservation programs said Adam Carpenter energy and environmental policy manager at the American Water Works Association.

“There’s a lot of the conservation programs that benefit the climate already but they’re not necessarily measured that way” Carpenter said adding that the reconciliation bill “would do a lot more of it.”

The 2018 farm bill (Public Law 115-334) signed by President Donald Trump was projected to spend $60 billion on conservation over a 10-year period or $6 billion per year — though those programs also encompassed rivers wetlands and other areas rather than specifically being directed toward farmers.

The conservation section in that bill didn’t mention climate-smart agriculture.

Womack said the climate agriculture funding in the reconciliation bill gives him hope for further conservation victories in 2023.

“We just haven’t seen a reinvestment in conservation of this size in a recent farm bill” he said.

Since being privatised in 1989 water companies have enriched investors and senior executives but failed to adequately invest in infrastructure. Shareholders have been paid £72bn in dividends. The cash came from big debts with companies borrowing £56bn and big bills with prices rising 40%. Private-sector efficiency did not provide better service but it did allow companies to be milked for cash.

Companies’ pressing concern was to make money rather than think hard about the challenge of the climate emergency. Hence water companies will impose hosepipe bans in record-breaking summer heat despite up to a fifth of water being lost to leaks. Two companies restricting water use – South West Water and Southern Water – have some of the worst environmental records. Thames Water which will ban lawn watering for its 15 million customers was fined £20m in 2017 for tipping 1.4bn litres of raw sewage into rivers. Last year the firm was found to have illegally discharged untreated sewage for 735 days.

Such failings are met by water companies with bromides designed to create the illusion of problem-solving. The firms get away with this because the water watchdogs’ bark is worse than their bite. The Environment Agency has said that water company bosses responsible for the worst pollution should be jailed. There is no sign of any chief executive facing criminal charges. In February the industry regulator Ofwat said Britain’s privatised water companies should link executive pay to performance. This summer the Thames Water boss Sarah Bentley will be handed a total of £700000 as part of a £3m “golden hello” pay package just weeks after her company’s terrible pollution record was officially recognised.

The sound most frequently heard these days in regulatory circles is that of the stable door being shut long after the horses have bolted. In June Anglian Water one of the UK’s biggest firms announced that it would be paying a £92m dividend to its owners. A month later Ofwat proposed new powers to prevent dividends being paid to shareholders.

The government has signalled that post-Brexit regulations are likely to be less not more onerous. Voters have every right to feel let down. There is a very good argument that privatised companies have been overcharging customers of natural monopolies by duping the regulator and paying off shareholders by loading up with debt. Such outrageous behaviour has been compounded it appears by a collective failure to make the investment that society needs.

Britain’s private utility model is broken. Services can clearly be managed by the state in a way that makes sense. The railways have proved ill-suited to conventional capitalism. The government has already announced plans to nationalise key parts of the electricity grid to help meet climate goals. The Treasury has been forced to pick up the tab as gas suppliers collapsed. Global heating means that water shortages and leaks are set to worsen. To stop companies being able to game the system and dodge their responsibilities will require a measure of state ownership.

U.S. homeowners with mortgages have watched their equity increase by about 32 percent year over year representing an equity gain of $3.8 trillion or an average increase of $63600 per borrower since the first quarter of 2021 according to CoreLogic a real estate analytics company.

The increase in home-equity wealth is expected to spur a record amount of home-improvement spending CoreLogic projects.

One Colorado reader called my 1-855-ASK-POST (1-855-275-7678) toll-free line asking for advice on using her home equity to remodel her home.

Background: The caller is single and 62. No children. She’s retired. She owns her home outright and it’s worth approximately $520000. She has about $350000 in retirement funds spread across bank accounts mutual funds 401(k)s 457s and IRAs. But this money has to last throughout her retirement years.

“My Social Security has not kicked in yet although I have applied for it” she said. “I’m living off my investments and credit cards.”

The repairs she wants to make are more cosmetic than necessary.

“The repairs would be nice to have such as remodeling my bathroom and kitchen” she said.

Her question: “Should I given the rise in interest rates take out either a mortgage or a home equity line of credit to finance repairs?”

Her debt situation: She has outstanding credit card debt of about $34000 on three cards. She still has about $11000 in student loan debt.

Her options: Homeowners have a few ways to access the equity in their homes — a cash-out refinance home-equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).

With a cash-out refinance you replace your current mortgage and borrow cash from your home equity. If you own the home outright you’ll get more cash out of the deal because there is no existing mortgage to pay off.

A home-equity loan also known as a second mortgage enables a homeowner to borrow money by tapping into the equity in their home. The loan is disbursed in one lump sum and paid back in monthly installments.

A HELOC is secured by your home and gives you a revolving credit line similar to a credit card. As you repay the balance your available credit is replenished. HELOCs often have a variable interest rate. The interest rate tends to be lower than what lenders charge for a credit card or personal loan.

Given the caller’s situation I wouldn’t recommend a HELOC. Here’s why:

To beat back inflation the Federal Reserve expects to continue to raise interest rates. If your loan has a variable rate the interest rate will likely increase.

If you’re already struggling to pay your bills getting a HELOC for home improvements that aren’t necessary isn’t financially prudent.

Alternatives to a HELOC: There are state and local programs that may assist with home repairs. Contact your local or county government housing department to check if you are eligible for such a program.

I asked the caller if she had considered a reverse mortgage which gives seniors a way to tap into the equity in their homes.

“I did think about a reverse mortgage but wouldn’t I be obliged to stay in my home for the rest of my life?” she asked.

Unlike a traditional home loan you don’t have to make monthly payments on a reverse mortgage. The loan isn’t paid until the homeowner moves sells or dies. When the home is sold any equity that remains after the loan is paid off is distributed to the person’s estate.

Typically a reverse mortgage works best if you plan to stay in your home for a long time.

“I believe I could age in place at this house” the Ask Post caller said. “My family has lived in this home for 52 years and it is perfect for a senior citizen.”

Borrowers can take the reverse mortgage loan as a line of credit a lump-sum payment fixed monthly payments or a combination. The loan size depends on the borrower’s age and other factors.

To qualify for a reverse mortgage you must be 62 or older. You have to have paid off your mortgage or paid down a considerable amount so that you have equity. Your home must be your principal residence. Most importantly borrowers must maintain the home and pay property taxes and homeowners insurance.

Share this article Share

A reverse mortgage wouldn’t be a bad option. She could use the loan to get rid of the credit card and student loan debt and make the repairs she wants.

But I suggested she come out of retirement and work full time or part time to save up the money for home improvements.

Advertisement

“I am considering a part-time job” she said. “The city is looking for retirees who can work part time as lifeguards. The salary will not be great but something is better than nothing.”

One thing she should keep in mind. Since she hasn’t reached her full retirement age Social Security will deduct $1 from her benefit payments for every $2 she earns above a certain annual limit. For 2022 that limit is $19560.

Miranda Lambert sings about her favorite dog ""Under that live oak"" buried in the yard. Chris Stapleton sings about a dog he found in a shopping cart that changed his life named Maggie who he buried on a hill on the farm. Losing a beloved pet is one of the hardest things a person can go through and what to do with their remains is a question many have to consider after their death.

If you live in an apartment or on shared grounds obviously you wouldn't consider burying your pet in your shared yard but homeowners or those who live on farms have the ability to bury their pets on their property. The question is is it legal to do so?

MY BEST FRIEND SAMPSON

When I lost my Great Dane Sampson I was totally distraught. I held his paw as he was put down and crossed the rainbow bridge. I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe. The Emergency service center that we were at offered burial to me and so I had a clay imprint of his paw made and I took it home with me and they disposed of his body. I knew that I didn't have the capability of burying him myself and it was the best option for me. For some burying their pets close to their home is very important.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?

Which leads to the question; Is it legal to bury your dog in your yard in Minnesota?

In most states you are allowed to bury your pet in your backyard but there are various regulations for burial depending on what state you live in.

In Minnesota it IS legal to bury your beloved pet in your yard. But it has to be buried at a specific depth so scavenging animals can't dig up the remains. According to revisor.mn.gov: ""Any domestic animal that has died shall as soon as reasonably possible be buried at a depth adequate to prevent scavaging by other animals on the grounds.""

Amgen has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ChemoCentryx Inc. a biopharmaceutical company focused on orally administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases inflammatory disorders and cancer. Under the agreement ChemoCentryx will be acquired for $52 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $3.7 billion.

“The acquisition of ChemoCentryx represents a compelling opportunity for Amgen to add to our decades-long leadership in inflammation and nephrology with Tavneos a transformative first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis” commented Robert Bradway chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen a leading company in inflammation and nephrology with a diverse portfolio and pipeline. “We are excited to join in the Tavneos launch and help many more patients with this serious and sometimes life-threatening disease for which there remains significant unmet medical need. We also look forward to welcoming the highly skilled team from ChemoCentryx that shares our passion for serving patients suffering from serious diseases.”

Tavneos is an orally administered selective complement component 5a receptor inhibitor. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in October 2021 as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (the two main forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis) in combination with standard therapy.

ANCA-associated vasculitis is an umbrella term for a group of multi-system autoimmune diseases with small vessel inflammation. Inflamed vessels may rupture or become occluded giving rise to a broad array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response which may result in profound injury and dysfunction in the kidneys lungs and other organs.

In addition to Tavneos ChemoCentryx has three early-stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors in other inflammatory diseases and an oral checkpoint inhibitor for cancer.

“A fierce commitment to improving human lives is the bond that unites Amgen and ChemoCentryx today” stated Dr Thomas Schall president and chief executive officer of ChemoCentryx. “Last year after 25 years of proud history we at ChemoCentryx delivered on our founding promise with the approval of Tavneos for patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis). It is an honour to now join Amgen’s great mission and together begin a bright new era bringing landscape-shaping medicines like TAVNEOS to those who will benefit most.”

US sales of Tavneos in the first quarter of 2022 were $5.4 million. Tavneos is also approved in major markets outside the US including the EU and Japan. Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. will retain exclusive rights to commercialize Tavneos outside the US except in Japan where Kissei Pharmaceutical Co. holds commercialisation rights and Canada where Otsuka Canada Pharmaceutical holds commercialisation rights.

The transaction has been unanimously approved by each company’s board of directors. The transaction is subject to ChemoCentryx stockholder approval regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYW5uZW5iZXJnLnVzYy5lZHUvYm9hcmQtbWVtYmVyL2p1ZHktZ2F3bGljay1icm93btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judy Gawlick Brown | USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism,"Judy Gawlick Brown Senior Vice President Corporate Affairs Amgen; Center for Public Relations Board Member

The Deutsches Museum is one of the world’s largest museums of science and technology and Amgen has had a long-standing relationship with the museum with the Amgen permanent exhibit first going on display in 2009. Following recent reconstruction of the museum the Amgen exhibit is now located at the main entrance – so all visitors 1 million annually are welcomed by Amgen’s modules.

Nearly 30 Amgen employees from Amgen’s two sites in Germany (both recently featured in the Places of Amgen series on Instagram) assisted in designing the new exhibition materials which include interactive videos animations models and graphics that illustrate how biotechnological medicines are created and how they can fight serious diseases.

The first stop in the exhibit explains the difference between chemically synthesized drugs and biopharmaceuticals. The complex manufacturing processes of biopharmaceuticals a key distinguishing feature are also presented in a way that is easy to understand.

Amgen’s innovative BiTE® (bispecific T‑cell engager) technology is front and center illustrated using models a graphic novel and other animations. These anti-cancer immunotherapies have been developed by the team at Amgen Research (Munich) GmbH and the exhibit shows how BiTE® molecules activate the body's own T cells in the fight against cancer.

""We are very pleased to make the possibilities of medical biotechnology tangible with our immuno-oncological approach"" explains Peter Kufer managing director of Amgen Research Munich GmbH and developer of the BiTE® technology. ""The BiTE® technology is also a great example of innovation 'Made in Germany'.""

In addition one video installation models a three-dimensional cross-section of an artery showing how cholesterol impacts the body while another interactive component is called “Insight Bone” because it shows the viewer’s movements mirrored by a skeleton to highlight the effect that osteoporosis may have on a patient’s life.

""As a pioneer in biotechnology it is important to us to inform the general public about our innovative technology and its potential in medicine"" says Manfred Heinzer managing director of Amgen GmbH. “A survey that we carried out last year indicates a major gap in knowledge among the population: 97% of those surveyed have no idea what the term ‘biopharmaceuticals’ means.

Investigational drug

Tarlatamab is an investigational potential first-in-class half-life extended bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) molecule that is uniquely designed to target delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) in neuroendocrine cancers such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer – both of which have high unmet medical needs.[1][2][3]

DLL3 is highly upregulated on the cell surface of neuroendocrine tumors and rarely expressed on nonmalignant cells making it a novel target for investigating a BiTE immuno-oncology molecule.[2][3][4]

An aggressive disease

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a particularly aggressive form of the disease that accounts for about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers.[5] SCLC tends to spread faster than NSCLC with nearly 70% of people with SCLC having metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.[5]

The five-year survival rate for advanced SCLC remains low at 3% and unfortunately treatment options have not changed much in several decades.[6][7] Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is an emerging treatment target that is expressed in greater than 80% of SCLC tumors with minimal expression in normal cells.[8]

The overall incidence and mortality rates of SCLC in the United States have decreased during the past few decades.[9] Estimated new cases and deaths from lung cancer (SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] combined) in the United States in 2022 includes 236740 new cases and 130180 deaths caused by the disease.[9]

Study design

In heavily pretreated patients with SCLC (n=106) a population with few treatment options beyond first-line investigational tarlatamab demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with notable response durability. Tarlatamab delivered a confirmed ORR of 23% (confirmed and unconfirmed responses) a median duration of response of 13.0 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 13.2 months.

Adverse events

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 97 patients (92%) and TRAEs grade ≥ 3 occurred in 33 patients (31%). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was primarily grade 1/2 mostly occurred in Cycle 1 rarely occurred in subsequent cycles and was generally manageable. Overall treatment discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs was low (4%).

Based on these data a potentially registrational Phase 2 study of tarlatamab in the third-line treatment of SCLC is currently enrolling patients. Additional studies investigating tarlatamab are underway including DeLLphi-303 a Phase 1b study testing tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line SCLC and a Phase 1b study in de novo or treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer.

Ongoing studies

Tarlatamab is being investigated in multiple studies including DeLLphi-301 a potentially registrational Phase 2 study in relapsed/refractory SCLC; DeLLphi-303 a Phase 1b study testing tarlatamab in combination with standard of care therapies in first-line SCLC; DeLLphi-302 a Phase 1b combination study with AMG 404 in second-line or later SCLC; and DeLLpro-300 a Phase 1b study in de novo or treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer.

About a year ago ex–Navy SEAL Rob Snowberger as the new CEO of Nantero was assigned a new mission: Make a 20–year–old carbon nanotube memory maker profitable. We sat down with him to talk about how things are going with the 50 employees the firm has in California Delaware Florida Massachusetts Pennsylvania and Texas.

Rob what background information will help us understand where Nantero is today in its profitability quest?

I’m the CEO and have been since August 2021. That’s when the company was purchased by the Overview family who have been involved in the semiconductor business for years through one of their construction businesses focused on contracts to build secure microelectronics facilities.

I’d been running one of their other investments through a company called Honeycomb. This was a company established to commercialize several carbon nanotube (CNT) microelectronic technologies developed by the U.S. government that no longer needed to be classified. In trying to execute on the mission of Honeycomb all CNT–related roads led back to Nantero and the very mature CNT process flow and fab–stable aqueous CNT solution they’d developed as well as the non–volatile carbon nanotube memory NRAM they’d invented.

By MRPeasy 05.01.2024 By Stephen Las Marias 04.18.2024 By Global Unichip Corp. 04.18.2024

I’m a former Navy SEAL having served two tours in Iraq. I received my MBA from Wharton where I got my start in Silicon Valley with a startup called Project NMSET. We developed a MEMS technology that could be useful as a microscale propulsion device but it had issues operating at sea level. We found some interest for the technology at NASA Ames Research Center to be used for Martian rover projects. But we pivoted it to become a medical device. That technology is now going through FDA trials.

Nantero is the world leader in CNT semiconductor technology and has been developing both non–volatile memory and most recently CNT–based transistors. The Overview family’s vision for the company has been to transition it from a licensing–focused company to a product company. The company has been around for 20 years. For the first 10 years Nantero was essentially a chemical company that was developing CNT solutions to go into spin coaters and semiconductor fabs. Nantero has done some very impressive chemical engineering and has come up with a very particular process to spread carbon nanotubes uniformly across a 12–inch wafer that can be accepted in high–quality fabs.

Over the past seven years there was a transition within Nantero to focus on building devices out of this fab–stable CNT process. That’s been a real challenge as a startup company; to prove your technology in a commercial setting is extremely expensive and cost prohibitive. There wasn’t enough time within any one engagement to mature the technology within a high–quality commercial–scale fab so that it could merge into the commercial roadmaps established by partners who were interested in our memory. At least one of the engagements was to get NRAM onto a DIMM card which means you’re going up against a perfected memory cell like DRAM that’s been around for 60 years; it’s difficult to compete on the purity and the perfection of the memory cell itself but that’s what Nantero was going for.

In that particular engagement at a two–sigma level our bits were operating exactly as Nantero had expected which was as a non–volatile high–performance potential DRAM replacement. But we weren’t going to get there within the amount of time we were allotted within the fab to eliminate those troublesome tail bits so that we could talk directly to the processor and merge with the commercial roadmap. The project was scuttled. Nantero has improved this number and we have now achieved five-sigma quality through our most recent and ongoing engagement with Fujistu. We now have enough information to build what we know we can do and we’re going to do it on our own scale and in our own timeline because we know that the prior engagements with the big guys ran up against a global shortage of fab space. Also CXL architecture is opening a great door and we’re very excited about that.

There is great interest in our technology. We’re making some great progress with our Japanese partners who have invested and are betting heavily that CNT semiconductors will be a huge growth industry. They have helped us establish a project funded by the Japanese government. We’re the only memory technology chosen inside their Green Data Center Initiative and a $100 million funding pool has been established to further develop our CNT NRAM technology.

We aren’t the direct beneficiaries of that money as we’re not a Japanese company. But many of our Japanese partners who joined the consortium will be. This is a great thing for the advancement of our technology and those that believe in it but not such a great thing for Nantero or for keeping this technology in the U.S.

The CHIPS Act is important because for the first time ever we might see this level of investment possible from the U.S. side.

Anyone who has tried to launch a breakthrough semiconductor technology will tell you: small sources of state–backed capital aren’t enough to keep a U.S. technology at home. We came out of the Harvard School of Chemistry where Nantero co-founder and CTO Thomas Rueckes invented the technology. It wouldn’t be unusual to see our technology lost overseas even though it came from an elite U.S. research institution. That’s where the capital has traditionally existed to overcome the infamous “Valley of Death” that plagues virtually all U.S. startups in this industry.

I applaud and thank the Biden administration and this congress for their bipartisan effort because while it’s very complex and perhaps not easily understood it’s vitally important to the U.S. economy and will help to retain trillions of dollars of economic expansion and national security interests over the short and long term.

I recently interviewed Keith Krach. He was the undersecretary of state in the Trump administration and a key architect of the CHIPS Act. (CHIPS stands for “Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors” but the act goes beyond computer components.) Krach was saying we’ve got to find a way to keep technology developed in the United States from going overseas. And he was saying in particular China. I don’t think that’s really a danger in Nantero’s case. Right?

Carbon nanotubes are one of the few natural semiconductor elements in existence. Several companies including most famously IBM had CNT programs but have given up. People who write us off say “if IBM couldn’t figure it out then you guys certainly can’t.” We’re doing something completely different than what they did. As I understand it they were trying to align individual tubes or at least make specific directional alignments of tubes that was just too hard. We find conductive pathways through a mesh of tubes within an aqueous slurry that’s spread out over the wafer and we have proven that. Several companies have been very impressed with what we’re doing and we hope to announce some of our significant strategic engagements coming up.

In regard your question about China you’ll find CNTs on corporate roadmaps usually for transistors. It’s largely understood that CNTs will offer the best opportunity to create a perfectly linear transistor but ultimately everybody thinks that’s 10 years down the line. That would be somewhat of a “holy grail” for transistors. Here’s the interesting thing however. Our thin–film CNTs spread out uniformly over a 12–inch wafer and we have perfected that process to create a very beautiful blue coating that we’re now using to build transistors. We have a program with Purdue University under Joerg Appenzeller where we’re building transistors. Purdue has been a really great partner and we’re very appreciative of their leadership. CNT transistors may not be so far away as everyone thinks.

Analog Devices and SkyWater have been working with MIT to commercialize carbon nanotube technology. How do these companies stack up?

From what I have heard we’re far in advance of where they are. From my year with Nantero I have been unbelievably impressed. Nantero has already solved many of the issues they are running into with the work at MIT. It’s my assessment that Nantero has an “embarrassment of riches” with what it has accomplished in fab.

At this point how has Nantero commercialized CNTs?

Nantero is engaged with Fujitsu on a milestone–based performance program for a chip that would ultimately lead to licensing revenue for Nantero. While our company focus is now to build our own chips and get away from licensing we’re honoring this prior commitment. Five years of uninterrupted development within a high–quality fab has given us extremely important data. Fujitsu has advertised that our technology is aimed to merge within their ferroelectric business line.

This project was supposed to have been delivered in 2019. This was a problem with the licensing business previously held by Nantero as they had financial difficulty in meeting the R&D spend necessary to hit the milestones as defined by Fujitsu. When I came in as CEO we started funding the development again and are back on target with an extended timeline.

The U.S. government has employed the use of NRAM for several applications especially in space. Lockheed Martin purchased the rights from Nantero to pursue government business a long time ago and so I am not certain of all the applications but I do know from my work with Honeycomb that NRAM has had success within these small–batch applications.

Nantero has had working chips for decades. Filling small batch requests from Lockheed or anyone else hasn’t been a problem; we can easily find working parts on a wafer and fill orders for niche applications. The real challenge for a commercial memory company is getting six-sigma yield. If you must throw away 20% of your chips (not including edge chips) you aren’t going to be competitive.

The new company focus is building what we know we can do. We know exactly the heartbeat of NRAM what it’s capable of what we need to do with a controller outside the memory cell. We’re going to push that into the marketplace.

How soon is that going to happen?

We have an engagement. We have a foundry lined up. We haven’t signed documents just yet as the CHIPS Act possibilities aren’t decided and those dynamics could drastically change any business agreement. We also have base wafer commitments coming from one of the big foundries in the U.S. We have aligned a program that will have us to market with our own competitive CNT memory chip in 24 months.

Is Nantero profitable? It’s not public. So it’s kind of hard to see the financial information all that sort of stuff.

Nantero isn’t profitable. It’s made about $130 million during its 20–year existence. We’re an R&D company in transition to a new business plan. We spend a lot of money in those valleys between when you make money and when you come out with your next chip. That doesn’t mean that Nantero hasn’t been profitable in the past but since we have been refocusing the business model it’s not.

Do you have any insight into when the company might become profitable?

Nantero has sold chips in the past. With the Fujitsu engagement we’re essentially paying for the development of the chip they want and at certain milestones they will start paying us licensing revenue. That would be enough to make Nantero profitable. But we can also focus that chip for applications outside of Fujitsu’s interests and that’s the nearest term target that we have; we can take the chip that’s already at a five–sigma level and work toward commercialization. We can be profitable within six months based on revenue from this activity. It’s not going to be the DRAM–level CXL–polished chip that we’re planning to build in 24 months but it will be a nonvolatile memory for niche applications.

Just to recap a bit your first products would go on DIMM cards right? And then CXL?

We have a ton of data from our last engagement on what would be a DIMM card. That would be the “holy grail” of memory. We can continue to build toward that end and to getting errors corrected on chip but in conjunction we can go after a system–level solution in CXL architecture.

The chip we’re planning to build will present as a DDR5 chip and CXL is a very attractive way to make that happen. When it comes to those tail bits you can do off–chip error correction within the CXL module itself. That would allow the excellent performance and added features of NRAM to be deployed while we continually enhance the cell itself and one day can perform directly on the DIMM bus.

NRAM is the fastest reading memory with reads between 2 and 20 nanoseconds depending on the cell architecture; if you put a system wrapper around that to bump up our write times we’re still faster than the others. We can put a system wrapper around it that preserves that super low latency starting point our technology offers. From there we will start to get to next generations of the core cell design and we will begin to build toward that excellent performance that DRAM has developed over its 60 years of deployment. CXL will accelerate all of that.

Would the plan be to license technology at the same time as you do manufacturing?

We have transitioned the company from a licensing focus to a product focus. The Fujitsu project was so far along that we decided to continue with the current plan for that specific product even though it’s a licensing arrangement. When we achieve the milestones set out in that engagement hopefully they would still be interested to take the chip in–house and pay the licensing fees or maybe they will simply choose to buy it from us.

You are expecting to find a foundry partner?

Yes Nantero is fabless. We have our chemical facility in Woburn Massachusetts where we can get from raw material to fully completed CNT spin coat layers on a 300–mm wafer. The wafers go to fab wherever our current engagement is at the time. Finally the wafers are either sent back to us directly after passivation or they’re diced and packaged before they come back. But either way they go to our Sunnyvale California facility where we have Maverick testing machines.

We completely outsource our foundry work and naturally most of that’s overseas. We do however need a fab for consistent development of the technology. Through the Fujitsu project we were last in the UMC (United Microelectronics) fab in Mie Japan which is called USJC. That was the last foundry we were in through December of 2021. Now we have a new engagement set up here in the U.S.

Now that the CHIPS Act has passed we’re anticipating the landscape for emerging technologies to get better. Not all emerging technologies will work out. Companies either go overseas where there’s capital to make it across the “valley of death” or they simply go away and the technology gets purchased for very cheap by a larger company.

With regard to the CHIPS Act you said it’s possible that Japan will take the lead in this business. Why would that matter?

The policy makers and ultimately President Biden—who signed this bill into law yesterday (Tuesday)—understand that we’re not going to recreate what’s already been created in Taiwan or Shenzhen or wherever. What they have said specifically in the language of the bill is that the CHIPS Act is about “breakthrough technologies” as well as manufacturing capability in the United States. We have to find breakthrough technologies to get back into the race and the U.S. happens to be the birthplace of many of the world’s best technologies. They just haven’t been able to stick around to benefit the U.S. economy as the capital has been overseas.

Not all $52 billion is about funding breakthrough technology companies and research. The largest portion of the funding I believe about $32 billion is going toward returning manufacturing capability to the U.S. and that’s extremely important. However Provision 9906 of the bill would establish the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) for about $10 billion and that will help breakthrough technologies that are struggling to stay in the U.S. There is of course a risk that highly profitable companies will simply try to leverage the NSTC to fund their own corporate R&D projects that would have been funded out of corporate profit.

Congress President Biden and U.S. commerce secretary Gina Raimundo have done an excellent job in setting up the industry for success where larger companies will lead the way. But smaller companies won’t be left out in the cold. I am confident the larger companies will see that they will be more successful if they work with us. The end result will be that this investment of $52 billion by the taxpayers will return 50–100x.

Our technology will be inexpensive to produce and will help to significantly reduce the energy needed to run servers and datacenters.

NRAM doesn’t require refresh or pre–charge and can reduce energy consumption by 30% overall in these systems. The energy savings are like replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs and this is why the Japanese have included our technology into their plan to make Japan carbon neutral. We think this is a wonderful initiative and we’re proud to be a part of it. We just hope that the U.S. will recognize that the memory technology to help achieve this goal is here at home and support a U.S. program with similar goals.

The Japanese project is called the Green Innovation Fund and they have established ¥2 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) for the program aimed at making Japan carbon neutral by 2050. Within the larger program there’s the Green Data Center initiative worth about $1 billion. That’s where Nantero’s CNT memory has been picked as the only memory technology included in the program to offer solutions for a more energy efficient datacenter model. The program has established $100 million for Japanese companies to further develop NRAM. An investment of at least this size from the CHIPS Act will help keep the technology onshore where we invented it.

There are competing technologies like MRAM. How do you think NRAM stacks up?

Number one as I understand it is that we’re way cheaper; MRAM uses some very expensive materials. The major success that they have had has been as a non–volatile memory technology offered by fabs within chiplet designs and embedded memory into or next to logic devices. For this reason a customer may be willing to pay the extra cost for MRAM as a non–volatile memory solution because there’s just not much of it that they would need to buy.

MRAM would have a hard time commercializing as a standalone memory or in storage–class memory applications. Several big companies have taken MRAM seriously because it’s a great technology.

Nantero hasn’t focused on embedded applications yet but we certainly should. When we do we will be able to compete very well on cost with MRAM. MRAM is used in space applications but there are some issues with magnetic fields. Our NRAM is immune to these issues and when we were launched on a mission aboard space shuttle Atlantis in 2009 we performed for the duration with zero soft errors. We’re immune to disruptions by magnetic fields and perhaps very relevant to today we’re completely radiation hardened.

Many of the other emerging memories in the “emerging memory zoo” as it’s called have gone the system–correction direction already. Nantero has been trying to compete with DRAM for many years and throughout many engagements. Designers of other emerging memory technologies by comparison have accepted the imperfect nature of their cell design and chosen to correct their errors off–chip with a controller. I am excited to see what amazing performance characteristics we can pull through an off-chip correction process.

Do you think that Nantero is going to win in any of this CHIPS Act money?

I do. We have demonstrated that our technology is legitimate and has real potential to lower power consumption by 30% in data centers as well as offer new capabilities to next–generation computing processes. We’re the only American–based emerging memory company that’s 100% American owned and when it comes to addressing the issue of secure supply chains Nantero offers a really good solution. Nantero–sized chip projects are $100 million to $200 million based on where we are in our technology life cycle.

Private investors have committed to make private contributions to a CHIPS project secured by Nantero and we also have state governments that are interested to have this work come to their states. You can create an industry around it you can create jobs around it and you can create national defense initiatives around it and that’s what other countries have realized for so long. The U.S. government has now made the great decision of getting into that game and competing. The U.S. has the best research universities and institutions in the world but loses the economic benefits of commercialization overseas far too often. If we’re so fortunate to get an award we understand that taxpayers expect performance out of us.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vOTg2ODI3L2FuYWxvZy1ob3VzZS1vbHNvbi1rdW5kaWfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analog House / Olson Kundig + Faulkner Architects,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.archdaily.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /986827/analog-house-olson-kundig (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D846A86D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vOTg2ODI3L2FuYWxvZy1ob3VzZS1vbHNvbi1rdW5kaWfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlbmV3c2V1cm9wZS5jb20vZW4vcmVwb3J0LWRldGFpbHMtcmVzdHJpY3RlZC1ldXJvcGVhbi1hbmQtdXMtdGVjaC1pbi1ydXNzaWFuLXdlYXBvbnMtaW4tdWtyYWluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report details restricted European and US tech in Russian weapons in Ukraine,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlbmV3c2V1cm9wZS5jb20vZW4vcmVwb3J0LWRldGFpbHMtcmVzdHJpY3RlZC1ldXJvcGVhbi1hbmQtdXMtdGVjaC1pbi1ydXNzaWFuLXdlYXBvbnMtaW4tdWtyYWluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D846AA170>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlbmV3c2V1cm9wZS5jb20vZW4vcmVwb3J0LWRldGFpbHMtcmVzdHJpY3RlZC1ldXJvcGVhbi1hbmQtdXMtdGVjaC1pbi1ydXNzaWFuLXdlYXBvbnMtaW4tdWtyYWluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdGFsYXlhci5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWN1bG8vZWNvbm9teS1hbmQtYnVzaW5lc3MvcnVzc2lhLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1yZWNlaXZlLXdlc3Rlcm4tbWlsaXRhcnktdGVjaG5vbG9neS1kZXNwaXRlLXNhbmN0aW9ucy8yMDIyMDgwOTE0NTMzMjE1NzcxNC5odG1s0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0YWxheWFyLmNvbS9lbi9hcnRpY3Vsby9lY29ub215LWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy9ydXNzaWEtY29udGludWVzLXJlY2VpdmUtd2VzdGVybi1taWxpdGFyeS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWRlc3BpdGUtc2FuY3Rpb25zLzIwMjIwODA5MTQ1MzMyMTU3NzE0LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia continues to receive Western military technology despite sanctions,"Once the Russian invasion of Ukraine began it took US President Joe Biden just minutes to announce sanctions against Russia a round of trade restrictions targeting ""semiconductors telecommunications encryption security lasers and sensors"" among other materials aimed at preventing Moscow's access to cutting-edge technology that could be used in its encirclement of Kiev. The EU did not need much more time; it had prepared - and approved by the EU-27 - the first round of sanctions on Russia days before the fateful 24 February. Six months on however the Kremlin's economic isolation does not appear to be fully effective.

Russia's economic indicators do not reflect the real impact of the countless rounds of sanctions pushed from Washington and Brussels in the wake of the invasion experts say. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a 6% drop in its economy contained compared to earlier projections which predicted a much bleaker outlook for Putin. The Russian president has even had time to mock the trade restrictions to which he is being subjected by the West although some analysts interpret this as a collapse in Russian industry caused by restrictions on imports of electronic components. But these materials continue to arrive.

According to a Reuters investigation in collaboration with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) a British defence think tank based in London and iStories a media outlet specialising in Russia Western-made electronic components have continued to cross the border into Moscow. This is reflected in Russian weapons collected on the battlefield by Ukrainian troops which the news agency has shown to contain microcontrollers programmable chips and signal processors of US origin. These parts are indispensable to their operation.

The revelation has caused the companies involved to react. Companies such as Texas Instruments Inc Altera owned by Intel Corp Xilinx owned by Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) Maxim Integrated Products Inc acquired last year by Analog Devices Inc and Cypress Semiconductor owned by Germany's Infineon AG have seen their products integrated into weapons used by the Russian military. Commonly used chips have also been found inside the weaponry that make up standard products also manufactured by Western companies and sometimes not subject to the sanctions.

The trade in computer equipment between the West and Moscow has not stopped according to the Reuters investigation. From 24 February the day of the invasion until the end of May there have been at least 15000 shipments of electronic components to Russia from European and US factories. These shipments included microprocessors programmable chips storage devices and other items according to data collected from Russian customs records. The sanctions remain a dead letter in part because they do not cover all components and above all because there are suppliers who continue to trade despite the restrictions.

Some materials have been circulating in Russia since before the invasion allege companies such as Texas Instrument and Infineon which were singled out by the investigation. Customs records consulted by Reuters show that some of these parts were shipped before the invasion by third-party suppliers to numerous Russian military companies or other companies with links to the defence industry such as AO VOMZ AO NPK Uralvagonzavod and AO Radiopriborsnab as well as Rostec the state arms giant. Russia relies on Western technology for its arms industry; indeed the country has a long history of procuring contraband parts from the US.

Rostec whose CEO oligarch Sergey Chemezov worked with Putin in the KGB is considered the 'cornerstone' of Russia's industrial technological and defence sectors and has been included in the US- and EU-driven sanctions. The company does not produce many electronic components which is why it relies on foreign imports but it does carefully control the products it buys which it tests and certifies for safety."

He claimed the season-long Aon Risk Reward challenge and the corresponding $1 million prize it was announced Tuesday. That’s on top of the $4 million he earned Sunday for finishing first in the The Comcast Business Tour Top 10 both of which are bonus money on top of the record money he has already earned.

It has been a season to remember for Scheffler who has won four times including capturing his first major title the Masters. He remains first in the FedEx Cup standings as the playoffs get underway Thursday at TPC Southwind in Memphis Tennessee at the FedEx St. Jude Championship.

“I love this competition because you have to string together really good scores on some of the most challenging holes in golf – testing your ability and rewarding you for making better decisions” Scheffler said. “I am excited to win the Aon Risk Reward Challenge as it recognizes the work that my team and I put in throughout the season.”

This Aon Risk Reward Challenge is also being contested on the LPGA Tour where the best decision maker will also receive an equal $1 million prize at the LPGA’s season finale the CME Group Tour Championship in November.

The Challenge is based around chosen holes at Tour stops throughout the year and designed to test a player’s strategy on what are considered some of the most challenging holes a player will face week to week. For every participating event a player’s best two scores on the designated hole counts towards the season-long leaderboard. Scheffler had 29 birdies and three eagles on eligible holes this season.

Scheffler has earned $13.176 million thus far this year. Add in the bonus money that’s $18.176 million. He also has a chance to add another $18 million if he wins the FedEx Cup Playoffs plus whatever earnings he gets in the next three tournaments.

Safe to say Scheffler’s strong play has paid off for his wallet."

These New ETFs Are For You,"A leader in leveraged and inverse and thematic ETFs is launching new investment options for investors looking to place bets for or against two of the largest and most well-known companies in the world. Here are the details.

What Happened: Direxion is launching the first four of its single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs. The ETFs center on increased or inverse exposure to the daily performance of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

“Our new single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs allow active traders to seek profit or hedge risk with conviction” said David Mazza Direxion's managing director and head of product. “The ability to trade a Bull or Bear fund for Apple and Tesla is an excellent way for traders to respond tactically to potentially company events and market sentiment.”

The new ETFs are:

Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 1.5X Shares (NASDAQ:AAPU)

Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares (NASDAQ:AAPD)

Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (NASDAQ:TSLL)

Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares (NASDAQ:TSLS)

The new ETFs are considered higher on the risk scale and are meant for investors with an “in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results.”

“Direxion is excited to help meet the robust market demand for single stock leveraged ETFs from investors seeking returns that are 150% long exposure or -100% of the returns of Apple or Tesla for a single day” said Edward Egilinsky Direxion's head of sales and distribution & alternatives. “This is the latest example of our firm’s continued commitment to launching advanced trading tools for the active community.”

Why It’s Important: Direxion was founded in 1997 and has around $20.7 billion in assets under management. The new ETFs increase the company’s coverage in the inverse and single stock sectors for investors.

The new ETFs from Direxion follow the recent launch by AXS Investments of several leveraged and inverse daily ETFs. AXS Investments launched eight single stock ETFs recently.

They include the AXS TSLA Bear Daily ETF (NASDAQ:TSLQ). The ETF generated many headlines and was a popular target of Tesla fans and investors as the ETF has declined since launching.

AXS Investments also launched single stock ETFs related to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) PayPal Corp (NASDAQ:PYPL) Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE).

AXS did not release single stock ETFs for Apple and launched a bear ETF only for Tesla with a bull daily ETF pending. The new Direxion ETFs offer minimal overlap in that regard and could see strong investor interest.

Along with being two of the most valuable companies in the world Tesla and Apple are also two of the most popular stocks for investors and traders.

Researchers at the University of Adelaide Royal Adelaide Hospital and Griffith University in Australia together with colleagues at the University of Campinas in Brazil have come up with a new concept for a lead-free X-ray shielding material [Nine et al. Applied Materials Today 29 (2022) 101566 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2022.101566 ].

Ionizing radiation sources are widely used in medical imaging and therapy airport security engineering and the nuclear and space industries but protection is required to mitigate adverse health effects. Personnel and patients frequently exposed to ionizing radiation typically resort to lead (Pb) aprons which while offering protection are heavy inflexible toxic and of limited durability. There is great interest therefore in alternatives to Pb offering efficient radiation protection and many potential candidate materials have been investigated.

Now a team led by Dusan Losic have devised a new protective material based on a laminated structure of the two-dimensional material antimonene as an alternative to conventional Pb-free blend-and-mix composites.

“[Our] work addresses several key issues in conventional radiation-shielding composites such as agglomeration random distribution of shielding particles large-interparticle gaps low density micro-cracks etc. that can result in poor X-ray attenuation” explains first author of the study Md J. Nine.

Exfoliation of bulk antimony produces crystalline single-layer nanoflakes of antimonene that self-assemble into dense films with minimal interparticle gaps on cotton layers which are sandwiched together in an elastomer (PDMS) to form a flexible shielding material.

“The laminated structure based on antimonene demonstrates effective X-ray attenuation with an enhancement of 45% compared with its conventional form as a composite despite having an identical composition” points out Nine.

Laminated two-dimensional materials offer a new concept in X-ray radiation shielding believe the researchers with their unique nanolayered structures scattering and reflecting photons between the layers and their interfaces. The layered two-dimensional material offers improved shielding compared with conventional composites of the same composition and avoids issues such as microcracking and inflexibility.

“Applications include areas where we need protection from ionizing radiation such as in medical imaging radiation therapy airport security nuclear fuel imaging diagnosis of structural faults defense and space industries” says Nine.

Moreover the approach lends itself to the inclusion of different two-dimensional materials such as MoS 2 and MXenes to create multi-layered sandwich structures which could be effective in attenuating broad-band ionizing radiation. The researchers now plan to create lightweight prototype protective garments and explore the approach for high energy gamma radiation.

This approach of shuttling important bioactive compounds has paved the path for novel diagnostics and therapy for central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

Study: Nanotechnology-Inspired Extracellular Vesicles Theranostics for Diagnosis and Therapy of Central Nervous System Diseases. Image Credit: Life science/Shutterstock.com

Recently scientists have reviewed the effectiveness of nanotechnology-inspired EV systems for therapeutics and diagnostics of CNS diseases. This review has been accepted for publication in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces.

For this review relevant articles from the Web of Science and PubMed databases were obtained. This study highlighted how the application of nanomaterials has improved the efficacy of EVs against CNS diseases.

Potential of EVs in Disease Therapeutics and Treatment

Extracellular vesicles are naturally released membrane vesicles from most cells that can travel in different types of body fluids. Scientists have classified EVs into three groups namely exosomes microvesicles and apoptotic bodies based on their biogenesis.

Exosomes are small vesicles (40−150 nm) and are formed by inward budding of multivesicular bodies (MVB) which are subsequently released upon their fusion with the plasma membrane. Microvesicles are produced via outward budding and fission of the plasma membrane with sizes that range between 100 and 1000 nm. The apoptotic bodies are the smallest among EVs (1−5 μm) and are released during cell apoptosis.

EVs loaded with various cargos such as DNAs miRNAs mRNAs lipids and proteins are involved with long-distance cell-to-cell communication between immune cells glia endothelial cells and neurons. Research has shown that EVs play an important role in several physiological processes including neuronal-glial metabolic exchange neural plasticity progression of brain pathologies (e.g. stroke and tumors) brain homeostasis and neurovascular integrity. The evidence strongly supports the application of EVs as potential diagnostic and therapeutic agents.

More recently EVs have attracted much attention in biomedical research especially as natural therapeutics or carriers for their low immunogenicity ability to cross the BBB and innate stability. Additionally EVs can transfer complex information from the brain to the peripheral circulation system after crossing the BBB. This phenomenon has been exploited to design a novel liquid biopsy platform for diagnosing and monitoring CNS diseases.

Nanotechnology-based EV System for the Treatment and Diagnosis of CNS Diseases

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) traumatic brain injury (TBI) Parkinson’s disease (PD) glioblastoma (GBM) and peripheral nerve injury are some of the common CNS pathologies that are prevalent in the aging population worldwide. The majority of the treatment strategies fail due to low efficacy toxicity and brain penetration. Over 98% of small molecule drugs and 100% of peptides nucleic acids and proteins are impeded by BBB from reaching the CNS parenchyma. Advancements in nanotechnology have helped alleviate the challenges associated with the application of EVs against CNS diseases.

The multiplex biomarkers in EVs make them an ideal candidate for the early detection of refractory CNS diseases. Presently a clinical trial is evaluating the efficacy of exosomal LRRK2 as a biomarker for PD. Another study has analyzed the efficacy and safety of allogeneic adipose mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes in AD patients. Scientists have also investigated the potential of engineered EVs for CNS delivery.

Research has shown that superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have a strong theranostic potential for CNS diseases. The introduction of SPIONs to EV showed significant enhancement in their targeting abilities. Additionally these can be accumulated in the designated body tissues via magnetic guidance.

EVs loaded with SPIONs and curcumin targeted to gliomas exhibited a strong antitumor effect. Magnetic navigation considerably enhanced magnetic hybrid EVs localization to the targeted injured sites. Murine models showed hybrid EVs were able to specifically accumulate at targeted brain regions with neural inflammation. As gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have shown significant theranostic properties in the future the AuNP-based hybrid EVs could be designed for the treatment and diagnosis of CNS diseases.

The retention period of EVs at the targeted site could be prolonged by encapsulating them in hydrogels. Another advantage of this process is controlled EV release which can be achieved by modulating the hydrogel porosity swelling rate and degradation rate. Importantly the production of EVs has been enhanced manifold by using nano-based methods such as the cellular nano-operation method.

Where Do EV-Nanomaterial Hybrid Systems Currently Stand in CNS Disease Management?

Compared to naive EVs or single nanoparticles EV−nanomaterial hybrid systems have exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy and diagnostic strategies for CNS diseases. Many EV-nanomaterial hybrid systems can travel across BBB and deliver their cargo at the targeted site. To date EV-nanomaterial hybrid systems have been evaluated for their therapeutic efficacy and imaging applicability against many CNS diseases such as AD stroke gliomas and PD.

A small number of preclinical proof-of-concept studies have reported some changes in EV composition after being combined with nanoparticles. This observation limits their pharmaceutical application. Additionally challenges related to large-scale manufacturing of EVs and inefficiency in cargo loading are some of the limitations. In the future researchers should focus on developing integrated devices for the automated manufacture of therapeutic EVs with high purity efficiency and low variation.

Juan Manuel Benítez-García President Global Savoury at ADM spoke with vegconomist about such partnerships and how the company fits into the plant-based space.

In which areas does ADM offer alternatives?

We have a long legacy in plant-based protein solutions development and we support brands across the food and beverage industry seeking to expand their alternative and plant-forward options including meat alternatives – such as beef chicken pork and fish alternatives – ready meals specialized nutrition dairy alternatives and more.

With over 75 years of plant protein experience we continue to advance our knowledge and offerings in this space with the latest technology ingredients and solutions. Our historical expertise with textured vegetable protein (TVP®) for meat extensions and alternatives has helped us broaden our portfolio of plant protein ingredients and solutions based on soy and wheat proteins. This is complemented with our advanced extrusion capabilities to meet specific texture structure functional and clean label needs; plus our culinary solutions such as savory flavors food bases broths and stocks enable authentic flavours and textures for alternative meat products.

Our dairy alternative portfolio includes quality solutions for plant-based yogurts frozen desserts milk creamers and cheese alternatives that are just as creamy and rich as their traditional counterparts. Furthermore our plant-based proteins such as soy and wheat and our trend-forward wholesome ingredients such as ancient grains nuts beans pulses and seeds can help give an added boost of protein and fibre in baked goods while maintaining an ideal taste and texture. Our selection of plant protein ingredients can also help create delectable clean-tasting vegan baked goods by replacing traditional dairy products. Our plant-protein solutions and customised blends can also be used in specialised nutrition applications and incorporated into high protein drinks.

What alternative protein partnerships are helping ADM meet customer needs in this space?

Our partnerships and strategic investments in innovative start-ups are a key component for advancement in this space. Most notably our SojaProtein acquisition enables us to grow our local footprint and expand our world-class textured protein capabilities in Europe and around the world. By incorporating SojaProtein’s expertise and capabilities we’re able to enhance our global non-GMO and sustainably sourced ingredient capacity while guaranteeing speed-to-market as well as addressing an increasing consumer interest for plant-based foods in their everyday diets.

This acquisition also provides us with important access to a well-established customer base in southern Europe and expands our global capabilities to meet regional needs for European sourced non-GMO and sustainably sourced soy-elevated plant-based products all while offering the full power and promise of ADM’s technical know-how R&D expertise and protein design capabilities.

Additionally we’ve invested in New Culture for precision fermentation to make an animal-free casein protein and through PlantPlus – our joint venture with Marfrig – we’re opening doors to new alternative meat innovations. Our investments in Nature’s Fynd Perfect Day and Air Protein are providing us access to developing protein technologies based on fermentation techniques to develop alternative proteins.

Most recently our partnership with Eat Just on the GOOD Meat cultivated chicken brand was announced. With each of these strategic partnerships we’re looking forward to supporting the future of the alternative protein and plant-based space.

What can ADM offer in terms of plant proteins to potential partners?

We continue to advance our knowledge and offerings in this space with the latest technology processing and ingredients. When creating plant-based offerings across food and beverage categories we take a comprehensive approach that helps brands pinpoint the right plant protein ingredient or system needed for their formulation parameters.

We’re able to meet these expectations by providing integrated plant-based solutions that expand formulation possibilities powered by the size and scope of our protein and wholesome ingredient portfolio with over 30 diverse sources across soy wheat beans pulses nuts ancient grains and more.

What are ADM’s latest developments for the plant-based market?

Our latest developments are new solutions that enhance plant-based offerings under the NutriFlex™ umbrella. To meet specific brands’ needs NutriFlex™ includes three levels of protein-forward systems which are all ideal for plant-forward applications spanning from meat and dairy alternatives to snacks and bars beverages meal solutions and specialised nutrition products. For instance we recently introduced our MaxFlex™ systems of protein blends which deliver on-trend protein diversity with high PDCAAS scores (0.89-0.95). By using these blends formulators can easily achieve pleasing sensory attributes for plant-forward baked goods snacks beverages and specialised nutrition products with added protein claims.

Also under NutriFlex™ is our AccelFlex™ texture and functional systems and EdgeFlex™ full-service platform. AccelFlex™ texture systems are comprised of value-added ingredients purposely designed to address texture structure function and nutrition challenges whereas EdgeFlex™ provides a finished-product platform to help our customers get from plant-based concepts to finished products with a validated quick route to market.

Furthermore we’re leading the charge in the alternative protein space with our launch of Arcon® HM functional soy protein concentrates optimised for high moisture extrusion (HME) and production of a closer to meat-like whole-muscle plant-based offering. These new functional soy protein concentrates help address taste texture structure functionality colour and nutritional challenges of finished plant-based whole muscle-like products and close a gap in alternative protein offerings – opening up opportunities to mimic the sensory experience of traditional meat offerings.

The sensory experience is highly important for consumers considering purchasing plant-based alternatives. How does ADM build appealing plant-based offerings?

While nutrition is important for a majority of shoppers our primary research underscores that taste is equally important in plant-based products among global plant consumers who identify as flexitarian vegetarian or vegan1. We carefully incorporate selected plant proteins to satisfy consumers’ nutritional goals and desires while also providing functionality and a positive sensory experience. Using vertically integrated high-quality plant proteins that are clean neutral-tasting light in colour and high in functionality is vital to creating offerings that capture consumers’ attention and satisfy their needs.

For instance soy protein remains one of the most crucial plant proteins to replicate the “bite” and “chew” of many plant-based alternatives to beef chicken and fish and is the top plant protein in global alternative product launches. We use our textured soy proteins and our soy protein isolates and concentrates to increase products’ protein content and provide an exceptional meat-like texture. Plus our wheat protein is a non-GMO option and it helps to enhance meat-like textures while delivering a neutral clean flavour.

Our culinary sensory and analytical teams create rich and savoury vegan flavours and mouthfeel components for meat and dairy alternatives to meet consumers’ sensory expectations with offerings they crave.

Ensuring network operations and protecting them from cyberattacks has become paramount to modern enterprises.

“You can almost imagine that networks would be on par with power and water and electricity and that kind of stuff” Nikhil Handigol co-founder of Forward Networks tells The Next Platform. “You cannot imagine a modern business functioning without its network functioning. On one hand networks were super critical for big businesses and are becoming increasingly critical. On the other hand they’re becoming more and more complex and more and more fragile both from a connectivity perspective and from a security perspective. From a connectivity perspective they were so fragile that one misconfiguration could take the entire network down. It’s still the case.”

Forward Networks is among the vendors in the rapidly evolving networking space that is using digital twin technology to help enterprises automate their infrastructure both in the cloud across clouds and on-premises to improve visibility performance and security. It was launched in 2013 by Handigol and three others – David Erickson (now the CEO) Brandon Heller (CTO) and Peyman Kazemian – who were all part of the group at Stanford University almost two decades ago that helped develop and launch software-defined networking (SDN).

The company has raised more than $62 million over three funding rounds between 2014 and 2019 and now has more than 70 employees Handigol says.

In launching Forward the four saw an opportunity to leverage mathematical model that would form the basis for its digital twin technology. The overall digital twin space is booming with Fortune Business Insights predicting the global market will grow from $8.88 billion this year to almost $96.5 billion in 2029. The idea behind them is to create real-time virtual representations of complex and dynamic physical objects or processes – think cars or factories – that is fed data from those systems and then is able to run simulations to make improvements or improve performance.

“A digital twin network allows network operators to design network optimization solutions perform troubleshooting what-if analysis or plan network upgrades taking into account the network’s expected user growth” researchers from such organizations as the Barcelona Neural Networking Center Telefonica Research and Huawei wrote in a paper released in January. “Since the interaction with the DTN does not require access to the real network the aforementioned processes can be carried out in real-time without jeopardizing the physical network.”

Modeling such highly complex systems has been made possible by advances in machine learning the wrote.

Many networking vendors to varying degrees are adopting digital twins to varying degrees from Cisco DNA Juniper with its Mist AI capabilities and Extreme Networks to cloud providers like Amazon Web Services Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud in their network management services.

Forward’s founders were driven by the fragility they saw in modern networks born out of their increasing size – tens of thousands of network devices like switches routers and load balancers – the diverse nature of those devices from multiple vendors and the configuration of the devices Handigol says.

“This is a of system with complexity increasing in these three very different dimensions” he says. “What that means is they have reached a stage where it the complexity has outgrown human capacity. It is very common to see this happen. [In June] there was a major Cloudflare outage. It was just one networking configuration that made a whole bunch of datacenters go down. All the businesses that were dependent on Cloudflare went down along with it. That’s just one bad change that took down a whole bunch of companies and all kinds of services. It’s that fragile because it’s all connected.”

Most other fields in IT from software to databases to distributed systems have evolved over the years in ways that networking hasn’t. They need fundamentally new capabilities to tame the complexity Handigol says.

Forward’s platform is a digital twin of an enterprise’s network. The vendor uses Google Maps as an analogy saying that Google Maps is essentially a digital twin of the transportation system with updated information about road traffic construction and other factors feeding data to map and display all possible paths between destinations and recommend the best one. Likewise Forward’s digital network twin shows all possible paths for packets based on current conditions rather than the more static diagrams in Visio.

“We not only understand every single element that is there but what is there and how it’s connected” he says. “That’s the basis. But more importantly Forward understands every possible way in which any traffic can flow through the network. Not just what’s going on right now but what is possible given the current configuration and the state of the network. That’s the kind of behavior that Forward analyzes computes and makes accessible to the network and security teams.”

At its core is the mathematical model the company has developed. A key analysis Forward does as part of the digital twin is pre-compute index and make searchable all possible traffic paths through the network which Handigol says is an extremely powerful capability for the network security and cloud teams and a “massive differentiator” for the company. Kazemian outlined the mathematical model in his 2013 PhD thesis.

“Performing such an analysis is not trivial” he says. “If you naively enumerate each packet and trace it through the network the problem becomes intractable. This is where mathematics comes in. Instead of looking at each individual packet Forward models classes of packets that are treated equivalently in the network as ‘header spaces’ – hypercubes in an N-dimensional space – and the behavior of each device in the network as ‘transfer functions’ that transform these header spaces. … It involves a lot of cool algebra and set theory. It is this mathematical basis that makes a product like Forward possible and scalable to networks with tens to hundreds of thousands of devices.”

Forward’s platform enables enterprises to search entire networks for any devices and connections to run path analyses both on-prem and in the cloud verify that the network is configured correctly and behaving as intended customize network policies and predict network behavior. Network administrators also can compare configurations at different points in time.

It also plays a role security identifying compromised hosts and devices continuously monitoring for issues and detecting connectivity problems. There’s incident management – what Forward calls “blast radius analysis.”

Recent partnerships have been a focus on security. Forward last month hooked up with Arista Networks integrating the company’s CloudVision cloud-based portal with Forward’s Enterprise platform to enhance monitoring change control and configuration management and ensure pre- and post-change verification. A month earlier Forward said it was integrating Rapid7 InsightVM vulnerability management tools into its platform enabling broad visibility for enterprises into their security posture.

“The network forms a core piece of this infrastructure because it’s a network that interconnects every system that’s supporting the enterprise” Handigol says. “It’s the behavior of that network that interconnects all these key pieces – your applications your databases your users and the rest of the world – and it’s the core piece of infrastructure that needs to be understood. end-to-end to be able to secure an environment internally. If you’ve got an insecure work if you can’t see what the network is doing how it’s behaving you can’t possibly secure that environment.”

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Jim (as he preferred to be called) was an award-winning mathematician a legend in quantitative investing and an inspired and generous philanthropist.

Together with his wife Simons Foundation chair Marilyn Simons he gave billions of dollars to hundreds of philanthropic causes particularly those supporting math and science research and education. In 1994 they established the Simons Foundation which supports scientists and organizations worldwide in advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences.

Jim was active in the work of the Simons Foundation until the end of his life and his curiosity and lifelong passion for math and basic science were an inspiration to those around him. He was determined to make a meaningful difference in the level of support that mathematics and basic sciences received in the United States notably by sponsoring projects that were important but unlikely to find funding elsewhere.

Over its 30-year history the Simons Foundation’s work has led to breakthroughs in our understanding of autism the origins of the universe cellular biology and computational science. Jim and Marilyn’s giving continues to support the next generation of mathematicians and scientists at schools and universities in New York City and around the world.

Jim frequently said that he went through three phases in his professional life: mathematician investor and philanthropist. He previously chaired the math department at Stony Brook University in New York and his mathematical breakthroughs during that time are now instrumental to fields such as string theory topology and condensed matter physics.

In 1978 Jim founded what would become Renaissance Technologies a hedge fund that pioneered quantitative trading and became one of the most profitable investment firms in history. He then turned his focus to making a difference in the world through the Simons Foundation Simons Foundation International Math for America and other philanthropic efforts.

“Jim was an exceptional leader who did transformative work in mathematics and developed a world-leading investment company” says Simons Foundation president David Spergel. “Together with Marilyn Simons the current Simons Foundation board chair Jim created an organization that has already had enormous impact in mathematics basic science and our understanding of autism. The Simons Foundation an in-perpetuity foundation will carry their vision for philanthropy into the future.”

Jim Simons is survived by his wife three children five grandchildren a great-grandchild and countless colleagues friends and family who fondly recall his genuine curiosity and quick wit.

We know that many people have stories messages and memories they would like to share about Jim. Please send them to [email protected].

Information on memorial services and other events honoring Jim’s life and legacy will be posted on the Simons Foundation website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2ppbS1zaW1vbnMtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcXVhbnRpdGF0aXZlLWludmVzdGluZy1waW9uZWVyLXdoby1nZW5lcmF0ZWQtZXllLXBvcHBpbmctcmV0dXJucy1kaWVzLWF0LTg2Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvamltLXNpbW9ucy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1xdWFudGl0YXRpdmUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLXBpb25lZXItd2hvLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1leWUtcG9wcGluZy1yZXR1cm5zLWRpZXMtYXQtODYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Simons billionaire quantitative investing pioneer who generated eye-popping returns dies at 86,"Jim Simons a mathematician who founded the most successful quantitative hedge fund of all time passed away on Friday in New York City his foundation announced on its website.

Pioneering mathematical models and algorithms to make investment decisions Simons left behind a track record at Renaissance Technologies that bested legends such as Warren Buffett and George Soros. His flagship Medallion Fund enjoyed annual returns of 66% during a period from 1988 to 2018 according to Gregory Zuckerman's book ""The Man Who Solved the Market.""

During the Vietnam War he worked as codebreaker for U.S. intelligence monitoring the Soviet Union and successfully cracking a Russian code.

Simons received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT in 1958 and earned his PhD in mathematics from the University of California Berkeley at the age of 23. The quant guru founded what became Renaissance in 1978 at the age of 40 after he quit academia and decided to give a shot at trading.

Unlike most investors who studied fundamentals such as sales and earnings and profit margins to evaluate a company's worth Simons relied entirely on an automated trading system to take advantage of market inefficiencies and trading patterns.

More women becoming single parents by choice

New York City — Up against her biological clock Traci Kodeck faced a tough decision at age 39.

She says she remembered the moment she decided to have a baby on her own.

""I was with my best friend and I said 'I don't have a partner I need to be a mom'"" Kodeck told CBS News.

She emptied her savings to cover fertility treatments ultimately using sperm donated by a friend. After three years of trying she had Zola.

""Then it was 'Oh my gosh I'm taking home a human.' And she was perfect"" Kodeck said.

Kodeck belongs to the organization Single Mothers by Choice. Its 30000 members are part of a growing trend of women having babies alone because they're tired of waiting for ""the one"" or they simply want to parent solo like Emma Ramos mother to 2-year-old Michael.

She describes her life as a single mother by choice as ""beautiful chaos.""

As a teenager Ramos dreamed of having a child not a partner. Modern attitudes have helped make that possible. According to a Pew Research Center survey from last year 78% of Americans find single parenting acceptable. Although more 93% support a two-parent household.

""That speaks to the misconception...that we have somehow purposefully handicapped our children by…only bringing them into the world with one parent"" Ramos said.

Ramos admits that the responsibility of shouldering the decision-making for her family does come with challenges.

""Decision-making I would say is a blessing"" Ramos said. ""But then I suppose if I make the wrong decision I'm the only one…to blame I guess.""

Zola Kodeck recently turned 11 just in time for Mother's Day.

""Having a single mom by choice can be hard like when you're first growing up but then my mom just wanted me nobody else"" Zola said. ""…Every day to me is like a Mother's Day.""

""Everything I do I do for her"" Traci said of her daughter. ""This house is for her. My job it's all for her.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2ctYml0ZXMtdHJhbnNpZW50LXdoby13YXMtYXR0YWNraW5nLXdvbWFuLWF0LWEtcGFyay_SAVBodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvZG9nLWJpdGVzLXRyYW5zaWVudC13aG8td2FzLWF0dGFja2luZy13b21hbi1hdC1hLXBhcmsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dog bites transient who was attacking woman at a park,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2ctYml0ZXMtdHJhbnNpZW50LXdoby13YXMtYXR0YWNraW5nLXdvbWFuLWF0LWEtcGFyay_SAVBodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvZG9nLWJpdGVzLXRyYW5zaWVudC13aG8td2FzLWF0dGFja2luZy13b21hbi1hdC1hLXBhcmsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83E7E530>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2ctYml0ZXMtdHJhbnNpZW50LXdoby13YXMtYXR0YWNraW5nLXdvbWFuLWF0LWEtcGFyay_SAVBodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvZG9nLWJpdGVzLXRyYW5zaWVudC13aG8td2FzLWF0dGFja2luZy13b21hbi1hdC1hLXBhcmsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

NVIDIA today announced a broad initiative to evolve Universal Scene Description (USD)  the open-source and extensible language of 3D worlds to become a foundation of the open metaverse and 3D internet.

Working together with USD’s inventor Pixar as well as Adobe Autodesk Siemens and a host of other leading companies NVIDIA will pursue a multi-year roadmap to expand USD’s capabilities beyond visual effects — enabling it to better support industrial metaverse applications in architecture engineering  manufacturing  scientific computing  robotics and industrial digital twins .

At its SIGGRAPH special address  the company shared forthcoming updates to evolve USD. These include international character support which will allow users from all countries and languages to participate in USD. Support for geospatial coordinates will enable city-scale and planetary-scale digital twins. And real-time streaming of IoT data will enable the development of digital twins that are synchronized to the physical world.

To accelerate USD development and adoption the company also announced development of an open USD Compatibility Testing and Certification Suite that developers can freely use to test their USD builds and certify that they produce an expected result.

“Beyond media and entertainment USD will give 3D artists designers developers and others the ability to work collaboratively across diverse workflows and applications as they build virtual worlds” said Rev Lebaredian vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “Working with our community of partners we’re investing in USD so that it can serve as the foundation for architecture manufacturing robotics engineering and many more domains.”

Open-Source USD Resources and Leaders Supporting USD

NVIDIA is releasing a collection of free resources to speed USD adoption including thousands of USD assets purpose-built to open up virtual-world building for users without 3D expertise. The company is also providing hundreds of on-demand tutorials documentation and developer tools to help spread USD education.

“USD is a cornerstone of Pixar’s pipeline and it’s seeing rapidly growing momentum as an open-source framework across not only VFX and animation but now industrial design and scientific applications” said Steve May chief technology officer at Pixar Animation Studios. “NVIDIA’s contributions to help evolve USD as the open foundation of fully interoperable 3D platforms will be a great benefit across industries.”

NVIDIA also announced investment in building USD plugins from popular 3D software ecosystems to NVIDIA Omniverse ™ a platform for connecting and creating virtual worlds based on Universal Scene Description. New beta releases include PTC Creo and SideFX Houdini with Autodesk Alias and Autodesk Civil3D Siemens Xcelerator and more in development.

“Siemens and NVIDIA are coming together to enable the industrial metaverse where the future of design engineering and collaboration will occur” said Dirk Didascalou chief technology officer of Siemens Digital Industries. “We are excited to support USD in the Siemens Xcelerator platform and plan to collaborate with NVIDIA on the next generation of the format.”

At SIGGRAPH  NVIDIA is also bringing together hundreds of engineering and product leads across the USD ecosystem into working councils to help align on USD development priorities and get feedback on where NVIDIA can centralize development efforts. Among the many companies contributing to and supporting USD are Adobe Autodesk Pixar and Siemens.

“Autodesk has been closely involved in the development of USD from its early inception as a means of standardizing the exchange of 3D data in animation and visual effects workflows” said Raji Arasu executive vice president and chief technology officer at Autodesk. “We have long understood the importance of 3D interoperability and have already begun extending USD’s applications beyond media and entertainment to design engineering and industrial applications. We are excited by the momentum behind USD from partners like NVIDIA which we believe will help better realize the concept of the metaverse and all the workflows it unlocks for our customers.”

Innovators in media gaming robotics industrial automation retail and grocery are already adopting USD as their metaverse language of choice including Kroger and Volvo Cars.

“The promise of USD is immense. At Volvo we immediately understood the value of the open extensible interoperable 3D scene description for our metaverse projects. Being able to maintain assets as a single source of truth and bring them from virtual world to virtual world will be seamless in 3D internet consumer applications” said Mattias Wikenmalm senior expert of visualization at Volvo Cars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHNoYXJrbmV3cy5jb20vZHJlYW13b3Jrcy1hdXRvZGVzay1vcGVuLXNvdXJjZS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1hbWF6b24tbWFrZXMtYXdzLXRoaW5rYm94LXRvb2xzLWZyZWXSAXZodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWRzaGFya25ld3MuY29tL2RyZWFtd29ya3MtYXV0b2Rlc2stb3Blbi1zb3VyY2Utc29mdHdhcmUtYW1hem9uLW1ha2VzLWF3cy10aGlua2JveC10b29scy1mcmVlP2hzX2FtcD10cnVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dreamworks & Autodesk open-source software Amazon makes AWS Thinkbox tools free,"Free is the new black as influential software packages from Dreamworks and Autodesk pivot towards being open source and AWS Thinkbox’s vfx pipeline products are now free to download.

As we head into the sort of global financial uncertainty that could provide a rude awakening for a significant portion of the world’s population never mind the production and vfx industries some of the big companies are responding by making sure their products are more widely disseminated than ever.

News that Autodesk is open-sourcing RV its award-winning media review and playback software was one of the surprise announcements that heralded the start of this year’s Siggraph. The PR that came out with the news talked suitably of ‘democratising access’ and helping to drive open standards and couched it in the context of another big open source announcement from the Academy Software Foundation.

This Open Review Initiative is a new project led by contributions from member companies Autodesk (see above) DNEG and Sony Pictures Imageworks with the goal to build a unified open source toolset for playback review and approval of motion picture and related professional media.

The RV code will be a key part of this initiative as it has been to Autodesk’s ShotGrid production management platform since Autodesk originally acquired it in 2015.

It wasn’t the first big open source announcement of the week though that honour belonged to DreamWorks Animation who said it was going to make its in-house renderer MoonRay open source.

MoonRay is DreamWorks’ state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ray tracer and has been used on a pretty stellar list of titles such as How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World Croods: A New Age The Bad Guys and the upcoming Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. It was developed in-house and includes an extensive library of production-tested physically based materials a USD Hydra render delegate and multi-machine and cloud rendering via its distributed rendering framework Arras.

This is a fairly big deal. As well as being able to provide that signature Dreamworks look it’s also capable of photorealistic work as you can see below will work well in a standard production pipeline and that Hydra delegate will ensure it will work inside the likes of Houdini and Foundry’s Katana. It will get its open source flavour release later this year.

The New Jersey-based human resources software provider will shutter its office next spring in the Britannia Business Center at 4125 Hopyard Road the San Francisco Business Times reported.

Its Pleasanton-based workforce will move to an undetermined office in the East Bay ADP spokeswoman Allyce Hackmann told the newspaper. The company once known as Automatic Data Processing filed a report with the state last month saying it would lay off 10 Pleasanton employees and shift the rest of its office workforce to remote work.

ADP has leased space at the business center since 1997 according to an investor brochure for the property. It signed a renewal for 63000 square feet early last year.

Britannia Business Center noted the software provider leased 94000 square feet at the four-building 292000-square-foot office campus in spring 2020.

The campus along the Tri-Valley I-680 corridor is owned by Menlo Park investor and developer Tarlton Properties and Chicago investment firm Harrison Street which paid $78 million for the office park in January according to the Business Times. The Tri-Valley area which includes Pleasanton had an office vacancy rate of 18 percent across 29 million square feet of office space in the second quarter according to Newmark.

ADP is the latest Bay Area firm to reassess its office needs in the era of remote work.

In July Twitter announced it would cancel plans to open a 66000-square-foot Oakland office a year after it leased the space. Early this year Autodesk closed more than 100000 square feet in San Francisco eight months after opening there.

ADP founded in 1949 operates two Bay Area offices in Milpitas and San Francisco according to its website and leases 5.6 million square feet of office and processing center space worldwide.

This feature extends the prebuilt System Knowledge by allowing you to add your own reference knowledge and enrichments. In the other article I outlined how this extension enables the automatic discovery of custom semantic types and the generation of enrichment recommendations based on semantic type discovery. In this article I describe another way to leverage this power and that's the discovery of custom category detection including variants (misspellings or non-standard category names) and automated data standardization or grouping of these detected categories. For details on how to create and add custom reference knowledge modules to your data consult the other article; this article assumes you have a working knowledge of the Custom Knowledge feature.

Let’s again pretend that our dataset authors have a business need to create prepare and analyze rapidly changing datasets from various third-party sources. The goal is to create a spend analysis for all the approved suppliers. One of the important columns in the datasets is a supplier name but the problem is that the supplier names in the files or tables are non-standard misspelled and abbreviated which causes issues when analyzing the spend based on the non-standard data. One way to solve this problem is to manually fix the non-standard supplier names by creating Replace or Grouping Transforms in the Dataset Editor. As you can imagine or have experienced firsthand this process can be extremely difficult and error-prone. Asking the third-party sources of your data is also very difficult or nearly impossible. This article outlines a governed way to automate the process of standardizing data by using the hidden power of custom reference knowledge in Oracle Analytics.

Let's begin by creating a dataset with our supplier spend information. Notice that the Supplier Name column contains many misspelled or abbreviated versions of the same vendor.

If there were only a few Supplier Names it wouldn't be difficult to standardize manually by using the Replace or Grouping Transforms. However in the real world columns such as this one might contain hundreds if not thousands of values which would be very difficult to repair by hand. And the cost of not repairing or standardizing data means that the data analysis will be inaccurate and even useless. Let’s take a look at the following simple visualization with non-standard supplier names. There are several versions of Adobe Systems and therefore the graph doesn't accurately reflect the total order quantity for each supplier due to the non-standard names.

We've already established that manual repairs of such non-standardized data are very expensive and error-prone and not repairing these non-standard forms is even more expensive because it causes our analyses to be incorrect. Let's see how to automate the detection and standardization of non-standard data by using reference knowledge that's custom to your business needs. Let's continue with the previous example and create a file in either MS Excel or CSV format that contains two columns. The first column is the key that the system uses to detect the column containing those values. The key column contains a list of all suppliers including all the known and possible variations of their names. The file includes a second column that contains the standardized value for each supplier name. This name can be anything but it's important that it's standard across all datasets.

For example for 3M Corporation we can choose to have a company standard of 3M. The first column in our file contains all the variations of that company name such as ‘3M Corp’’3M Corporation’’3M’’3m’ ‘3M Inc’ and similar. All those values will be standardized to ‘3M’. To allow Oracle Analytics to use this knowledge we ask our administrator to create a custom knowledge reference file by accessing the Console and uploading it. When the file is uploaded every dataset created is “aware” of this reference knowledge and if a new dataset includes a column that contains supplier names that's automatically detected and a recommendation is made to the authors of that dataset to “Standardize” the supplier name. For more information on how to create reference knowledge consult Oracle Analytics documentation or the other article mentioned previously. The following figure shows the reference knowledge creation preview screen.

Note: For this use case we only needed a single enrichment column for the standardized supplier name. However we could have created additional columns to the right of the standardized supplier name with relevant information such as supplierID cost_center etc. Each of those columns would create an individual enrichment recommendation which users could use in their datasets.

When the custom knowledge is uploaded the profiler references it for every dataset created in the system. Existing datasets can also benefit from the new reference knowledge. Simply open the existing dataset in the Dataset Editor and click the Re-Profile button on the toolbar. When new datasets or existing datasets are profiled with the new reference data the system automatically detects the Supplier Names column and profile as an enrichment recommendation. Accepting this enrichment recommendation adds a new column to the dataset with the Standardized Supplier Name. The following figure shows the recommendation being accepted and the new column being added to the dataset.

When the new standardized supplier name column is part of the dataset it can be used in an analysis and dashboard. Having standardized supplier names makes the analysis much more accurate and concise - providing insights as to the actual spend for each supplier. The following figure shows the improvement from the initial visualization of quantity ordered by supplier name.

Call to Action

We hope that you found this information useful and that you'll experiment with Custom Knowledge datasets to improve and govern the enrichment and standardization of column values in datasets being used in your organization. As you've learned from this example the reference knowledge doesn't need to be external reference data. There are many use cases such as standardizing values where organizations want users to enrich and repair data with internal reference data that's centrally maintained and this feature always guides users to the correct internal reference data. Whether you're working with small spreadsheets or big tables from a data warehouse there's nothing better than spending less time wrangling data and spending more time where the value is — analyzing your data! And make sure to stay tuned for future blogs with more tips and tricks!

MEMPHIS Tenn. — For the second time within the past year the St. Louis Cardinals’ Triple-A minor league affiliate is getting a new owner.

Beverly Hills California-based sports and entertainment company Endeavor Group Holdings (NYSE: EDR) said Tuesday it has inked a deal to sell its Diamond Baseball Holdings subsidiary which operates the Memphis Redbirds and nine other minor league baseball clubs to global technology investment firm Silver Lake. Affiliates of Menlo Park California-based Silver Lake hold stock in Endeavor.

The aggregate purchase price for the 10 teams is about $280 million in cash according to a regulatory filing Tuesday by Endeavor. The deal is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter.

Endeavor formed Diamond Baseball Holdings in 2021 after acquiring several minor league clubs including the Memphis Redbirds. Endeavor purchased the Triple-A affiliate from the team’s majority ownership group led by Peter Freund and the St. Louis Cardinals which held a minority interest. The professional baseball teams added to Endeavor’s sports and entertainment holdings which include entertainment agency WME mixed martial arts organization UFC and sports fashion and media agency IMG.

“Silver Lake will be an excellent partner to these clubs going forward given their deep understanding of the business and their incredible track record of investment in sports IP” Endeavor President Mark Shapiro said in a statement.

Silver Lake’s investment portfolio includes several sports and entertainment entities including sports marketing firm Learfield; Fanatics Trading Cards; City Football Group owner of Manchester City Football Club in the English Premier League; and Madison Square Garden Sports which owns the NBA’s New York Knicks and NHL’s New York Rangers.

After its sale to Silver Lake Diamond Baseball Holdings will continue to be led by its current leadership including Executive Chairman Pat Battle and Freund its CEO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbXBoaXNmbHllci5jb20vOTAxLWZjcy1uaWdodGUtdG8tcmVtZW1iZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,901 FC's Nighte to Remember,"Support the Memphis Flyer

This week more than a year after that Lockheed gave us an update on how things are going.

The NGI is supposed to be an upgrade of the existing Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) anti-ballistic missile system and is to be used “to protect the U.S. homeland from increasing and evolving intercontinental ballistic missile threats.” It’s not scheduled for delivery before fiscal year 2027 but that doesn’t mean work on it is not progressing.This week the American defense contractor announced it has recently validated prototype communications radio technology for the system. The tech is the one that will give the interceptor in-flight situational awareness and the ability to respond to threats.Although because of the nature of the technology no specifics were provided on the tech used we’re told the tests “demonstrated that the interceptor’s communications system can operate through harsh and adversarial environments it may encounter during flight.”“Early demonstrations like this allow us to learn as we go and manage risk” said in a statement Sarah Reeves vice president and program manager of the Next Generation Interceptor program at Lockheed Martin.“This milestone continues the NGI team’s successful early and often testing cadence of critical technologies within our digital system design as it matures in alignment with our Developmental Evaluation Framework.”When ready the Next Generation Interceptor will become the first line of defense against ballistic missiles and perhaps the most important part of America’s layered missile defense architecture. As per available info it’s supposed to launch from silos based in Ft. Greely Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.",,,,,,

Capital One has been on a tear the past few years making huge improvements to its Venture Miles program adding additional ways to use those miles – and more importantly more lucrative redemptions.

That means if you've got Venture Miles from cards like the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card or the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card they're far more valuable now than they were even a year or two ago. That's due in large part to the addition of excellent Capital One transfer partners and a brand new Capital One Travel Portal.

But then you throw in the longtime favorite option of using Capital One Purchase Eraser – pay for travel with your Capital One card then go back and cover the cost with miles – and there are three different ways to put your Capital One Venture miles to use. Deciding which avenue is best to make the most of your miles can be difficult.

In this post I'll walk through the three options for using your Venture miles and when it makes sense to use each of them.



Use the Capital One Purchase Eraser

Let's start with the easiest route for using Capital One Venture miles. This is what Capital One is really known for – and a big reason why many travelers love Capital One.

No airline or credit card company makes it easier to redeem points and miles toward travel than Capital One Purchase Eraser. Just charge your flight hotel Airbnb or almost any other travel expense to your Capital One card. A few days later you can go in and erase that charge from your statement using miles. No confusing award charts rules blackout dates or hoops to jump through.



Read our step-by-step guide to using Purchase Eraser to see how it's done!

Using Purchase Eraser every Capital One Venture Mile is worth 1 cent. That means you can book a $500 flight using 50000 Capital One miles. That's not exactly earth-shattering value but it's easy as can be – and it goes far when you find a cheap flight hotel or most other travel expenses.

Here's a real-world example. Let's say you're a Thrifty Traveler Premium member and just received an alert for $208 flights from Chicago-O'Hare (ORD) to Cozumel (CZM).



Just pay for that flight directly on the American Airlines website with your Capital One card go to your account a few days later and erase it from your statement for 20800 Venture miles. That's all it takes.

Purchase eraser is tailor-made for travelers who want a quick-and-easy way to use their miles. Don't want to deal with booking through third-party portals and don't want to decode the mystifying world of how airlines set award prices when using their miles? Purchase Eraser is for you.

There are a few advantages to using Purchase Eraser beyond convenience. For starters it's one of the few ways to make a flight completely free as your Venture Miles will cover the taxes and fees that booking with traditional airline miles will not. And you'll still earn miles with the airline you're flying.

But the real beauty of Purchase Eraser is that it can go far far beyond booking flights. Think of any travel expense and you can cover it using your Venture Miles … including expenses that other credit card points can't cover. For example…

You could cover a $500 Airbnb or VRBO reservation for 50000 Venture Miles

Charge your $40 train ticket anywhere in the world to your Capital One Card then erase it using 4000 Venture Miles

Book a tour or excursion through Viator or Airbnb Experiences then use Venture Miles to cover the cost

Ubers Lyft rides … you name it you can cover it with miles using Purchase Eraser

The list goes on and on. Needless to say there's a ton of flexibility and ease when using Purchase Eraser.

When To Use the Capital One Purchase Eraser

The Capital One Purchase Eraser is a great option for travel expenses where you wouldn't otherwise be able to use points – think boutique hotels that are not affiliated with a points program train tickets throughout Europe a transfer plane in the Maldives foreign airlines in which you don't have any points built up and the list goes on.

Plus using the Capital One Purchase Eraser allows you to book directly with the hotel airline or any other travel company. It removes the complication of a third party should things with your reservation go wrong. That means assuming the price is the same through the Capital One Travel portal and directly with the airline it may make sense to book direct and redeem miles with the purchase eraser.

Above all Capital One Purchase Eraser is your best option when flights (or other travel expenses) are cheap and you want to make them free. And if you just can't be bothered with learning the ins and outs of mileage program sweet spots and loopholes Purchase Eraser is a solid way to put your miles to use.

The Capital One Travel Portal

Just like the Chase Travel Portal Capital One has its own travel portal where you can directly search for flights hotels and car rentals then book using points. And the Capital One Travel Portal is new and improved with some great features you won't get elsewhere.



The new flight-booking engine is powered by the popular travel app Hopper. That means you should generally find the same prices you see directly through the airline or via Google Flights – but not always. Just tap in the details of the flight or hotel you're hoping to book with Venture Miles and start searching.

You won't get a bonus when using miles through the Capital One Travel portal as you do with Chase cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card or the Chase Sapphire Reserve®. Just like using Purchase Eraser every Venture Mile is worth 1 cent toward travel through the portal.

That means you can once again book that same $208 flight to Cozumel for less than 20800 Venture Miles. And whether you don't have enough miles in your account or want to save some you can apply as many (or as few) miles to the purchase to reduce the cost.



While you may not be getting more bang for your buck by using Venture Miles through the travel portal Capital One has given travelers a few compelling reasons to consider it:

Capital One will automatically refund you if the price of your flight drops after booking. Those Price Drop Protection refunds are only available on flights where Capital One and Hopper predict that prices won’t fall and they're capped on up to $50 – or 5000 Venture Miles – in refunds total. Still that's a nice feature.

Those Price Drop Protection refunds are only available on flights where Capital One and Hopper predict that prices won’t fall and they're capped on up to $50 – or 5000 Venture Miles – in refunds total. Still that's a nice feature. You can freeze a fare through the portal for up to 14 days then decide and come back to buy it later at that price. Capital One charges a small fee to freeze a fare.

then decide and come back to buy it later at that price. Capital One charges a small fee to freeze a fare. Much like Google Flights Capital One allows you to set price alerts for the flights you want to book. That means you'll get an email if the flights you're looking at drop or increase in price.

That means you'll get an email if the flights you're looking at drop or increase in price. Capital One offers an add-on “cancel for any reason” travel insurance policy which is quite reasonably priced.

If you're paying with cash rather than using miles you'll earn 5x miles per dollar spent on flights booked through the portal and a whopping 10x points per dollar on hotels and rental cars if you have the Venture X card and 5x miles on hotels and rental cars if you have the regular Venture Card.

When To Use the Capital One Travel Portal

There are a few scenarios in which using the Capital One Travel portal – as opposed to the other options for using your miles – can make sense.

First and foremost if you have a Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card you get an annual $300 travel credit to use for bookings in the Capital One Travel portal. Unlike the $300 travel credit that comes on the Chase Sapphire Reserve® you must make your booking within the Capital One Travel portal to receive this annual credit. It's far and away the #1 scenario in which you should turn to the Capital One Travel Portal – especially if you're booking boutique hotels or a rental car.

Beyond that you'll receive 5x points per dollar on flights if you hold the Venture X card and 10x miles per dollar spent on hotels and rental cars. With the regular Venture card you can earn 5x miles on hotels and rental cars. So if you are not using miles in the portal this can be a compelling reason to book through Capital One – assuming the pricing is similar to what you can find directly with an airline or hotel.

And here's a little secret: Any cash balance you charge within the portal can be erased with the Purchase eraser feature once that charge posts to your account. So you could book a flight through the portal with your Venture X card earn 5x miles on that transaction (as opposed to 2x miles if booked directly with the airline) and then use the purchase eraser to erase that charge with miles.

Beyond that taking advantage of the price protection and the ability to freeze pricing can be good reasons to book through the Capital One portal.



Using Capital One Transfer Partners

If if you want to get more value from your Venture miles you'll want to look into Capital One transfer partners.

Admittedly this method of using your Venture Miles is a little more advanced and will require some extra work. But for those ready to do their homework the value can be significant.

Capital One added the ability to transfer miles straight to airline programs back in late 2018. After steadily adding more and more partners and making significant improvements it's now a bonafide option with some killer value. With few exceptions every 1000 Capital One miles you transfer gets you 1000 airline miles or hotel points.

Here's the full list of Capital One transfer partners.

Read our guide to Capital One transfer partners and learn how you can transfer your miles!

It gets even better as Capital One regularly offers transfer bonuses giving you a 15% to 40% bonus when sending your Venture Miles to select partners on this list. That's a great way to squeeze even more out of your Venture Miles as these bonuses are practically free airline miles.

But not just any transfer will do. Knowing where to transfer your miles is a key to maximizing this redemption option. And remember these transfers are a one-way street. Once you send miles to an airline or hotel you can't get them back into your Capital One account. That means you'll want to make sure transferring your miles is the best option – and that the flights or hotels are actually available to book.

Make sure to read our post on the best ways to use Capital One Venture Miles for some ideas on how to maximize Capital One transfer partners.

When To Use the Capital One Transfer Partners

Looking to book a flight? Check the price directly with the airline and through the Capital One travel portal. Remember since your miles will be worth one cent each through these methods a $500 flight could be booked for 50000 Venture Miles. There is a chance that this would require fewer miles than what you could find using the transfer partners.

But there are no doubt sweet spots available when using Capital One transfer partners. For example using Air France/KLM's flying Blue program you can book Delta flights to Hawaii for just 35000 miles roundtrip whether you're flying Delta from Los Angeles (LAX) to the islands all the way from Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) to Honolulu (HNL) or a one- or even two-stop trip from elsewhere in the Midwest or East Coast.

Venture Miles also transfer 1:1 to Air France/KLM Flying Blue so 35000 miles means you're set. Just beware that finding the Delta flights you want can be a bit of a challenge so be sure to read our guide on how to book these flights to Hawaii for 35000 miles. And never transfer miles before you've confirmed the flights you want are available.

But when you do find them it's a deal that's tough to beat.



Whether you book through the travel portal or using Purchase Eraser these exact same flights would cost you more than 57000 miles. And in many cases the savings can be even more substantial by leveraging transfer partners.



When you learn and use sweet spots like this one transferring points will almost always be a better deal than taking another route.

Bottom Line

With Capital One Venture Miles you'll have three different ways to redeem points: The Capital One Purchase Eraser The Capital One travel portal and using Capital One transfer partners.

Each of these methods to book travel have pros and cons. But having all of the options at your disposal and using which one works best for you is ultimately what makes Venture miles so valuable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcmVidXNpbmVzc29ubGluZS5jb20vY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUtc2lnbnMtNjAwMDAtc2Ytb2ZmaWNlLWxlYXNlLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1hdC0xMTQtZmlmdGgtYXZlbnVlLWluLW1hbmhhdHRhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capital One Signs 60000 SF Office Lease Expansion at 114 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcmVidXNpbmVzc29ubGluZS5jb20vY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUtc2lnbnMtNjAwMDAtc2Ytb2ZmaWNlLWxlYXNlLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1hdC0xMTQtZmlmdGgtYXZlbnVlLWluLW1hbmhhdHRhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83E6E0B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcmVidXNpbmVzc29ubGluZS5jb20vY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUtc2lnbnMtNjAwMDAtc2Ytb2ZmaWNlLWxlYXNlLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1hdC0xMTQtZmlmdGgtYXZlbnVlLWluLW1hbmhhdHRhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS93YXNoaW5ndG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wOS9jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1mYWlyYmFuay1zdG9jay1zYWxlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capital One's Fairbank cashes in on $13.5 million in stock sales - Washington Business Journal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS93YXNoaW5ndG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wOS9jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1mYWlyYmFuay1zdG9jay1zYWxlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83E6D270>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS93YXNoaW5ndG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8wOS9jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1mYWlyYmFuay1zdG9jay1zYWxlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2lkZXN0YWdlbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2Fhcm9uLWxld2lzLWF0LWNhcGl0YWwtb25lLWhhbGwtdHlzb25zLXZhLTctMjgtMjAyMi1waG90by1nYWxsZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aaron Lewis At Capital One Hall Tysons VA 7-28-2022 Photo Gallery,"Aaron Lewis made a stop at Tysons VA’s newest concert venue Capital One Hall on Thursday night.

The Southern Californian startup first hit our (and most folks’) radar as a mug company. The company captured a fair bit of press attention with its high-end electronic mug designed to keep beverages a consistent temperature. Nichey? Sure. Mostly unnecessary? One could certainly make the case. But it was cool (or warm I suppose) enough to garner a good bit of early adopter buzz.

If February the company outlined the beginnings of a surprising pivot. CEO Clay Alexander spoke to TechCrunch about Ember’s plans to adopt its temperature regulating technology for non-consumer applications. At the end of the year it became clear that it would be focusing new efforts on the cold chain — specifically medical transportation. A month later it unveiled the Ember Cube shipping device.

Today the company announced that it will be spinning out its efforts in the form of Ember LifeSciences. The standalone vertical began life with an investment from Cardinal Health announced late last year. Brian Bejarano of Cardinal will join as president and general manager for Ember LifeSciences.

“The Ember Cube is the first of many healthcare technologies developed by our team and Ember LifeSciences is the entity where all our inventions in the healthcare space will live” Alexander said in a release tied to today’s news. “With Ember Lifesciences the goal is to deploy our technology to disrupt the healthcare distribution industry and improve the way we transport temperature-sensitive medicines and vaccines around the world.”

The new entity has a pair of new shipping containers in the pipeline that build on the initial Cube technology: “an ultra-low temperature shipper and a cryogenic shipper. Both are intended to be used to transport cell and gene therapy products and will also include the same cloud-based temperature reporting GPS location tracking and return-to-sender technology featured in the Ember Cube.”

Between both the continued vaccine rollouts and seemingly endless supply chain issues there hasn’t been a hotter time to launch a cold chain company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdmlsYmVhdC5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC9oYXdhaWktd2lsbC1zcGVuZC03OG0taW4tb3Bpb2lkLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtZnVuZHMtb24tdHJlYXRtZW50LWFuZC1wcmV2ZW50aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaii Will Spend $78M In Opioid Settlement Funds On Treatment And Prevention,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.civilbeat.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/08/hawaii-will-spend-78m-in-opioid-settlement-funds-on-treatment-and-prevention/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83943880>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdmlsYmVhdC5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOC9oYXdhaWktd2lsbC1zcGVuZC03OG0taW4tb3Bpb2lkLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtZnVuZHMtb24tdHJlYXRtZW50LWFuZC1wcmV2ZW50aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyZGluYWxuZXdzLm9yZy8yMDIyLzA4LzEwL2NhcmlsaW9uLXJlY2VpdmVzLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1naWZ0LWZvci1jYW5jZXItY2FyZS1tb3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carilion receives $1 million gift for cancer care; more . . .,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cardinalnews.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/08/10/carilion-receives-1-million-gift-for-cancer-care-more/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83940610>, 'Connection to cardinalnews.org timed out.

This week I’ll be sailing on Carnival Ecstasy from Mobile Alabama for a 4-night cruise to Mexico and back. We leave on Thursday and return on Monday morning.

Throughout the cruise I plan to live blogging each day of the voyage to share our experiences both onshore and onboard the ship.

Our itinerary is short and sweet with two days at sea and a stop in Cozumel Mexico. This cruise seemed like the perfect opportunity for a weekend getaway.

Image

During this weekend cruise on Carnival Ecstasy I’ll be sailing with my sister Angie. She’s my longstanding cruise buddy and I can't wait to make some incredible memories together!

One of the best aspects of this cruise is how close the departure port is to my house.

I live in the panhandle of Florida and Mobile Alabama is surprisingly the closest cruise port to my house. The port is a little less than 2 hours away from my house. On the other hand Port Canaveral is 6 hours away and requires a hotel stay the night before.

With the current chaos at airports across the country it will be really nice just being able to drive to the cruise port and not worry about the logistics of flying. It also saves time and money - we don’t have to take as much time off work or stay in a hotel the night before.

Carnival Cruise Memories

Although I’m a loyal Royal Caribbean cruiser I’m excited to try something different and take advantage of Carnival Ecstasy’s weekend getaway sailings.

While I've cruised over 30 times I’ve only sailed twice on Carnival Cruise Line. My first cruise was back in 2011 when I sailed on Carnival Destiny (formerly renamed to Carnival Sunshine now). It was a 4-night sailing to Cozumel and Key West. This was with my family on a spring break cruise from Miami.

Here's a picture of me and my sister from our last Carnival Cruise while docked in Key West. I told Angie she needs to bring those trendy sunglasses again to recreate this picture!

The second time I cruised with Carnival Cruise Line was on Carnival Fantasy back in 2016. This was another spring break cruise but this time with my (now) husband for his 21st birthday. We were college kids cruising on a tight budget but we still have really fond memories of ordering warm chocolate chip cookies to our room every night.

Carnival Fantasy was sold to be scrapped in 2020 but she is from the same class of ships as Carnival Ecstasy.

I remember enjoying the variety of food offered including Guy's Burger Joint on the pool deck!

Cheap Cruising

I’m all about traveling on a budget - the cheaper I can travel the more often I can getaway and see the world. When it comes to cruising I typically book the cheapest cruise and stateroom possible which means I can spend money on things like specialty dining port excursions and drinks.

Earlier this spring my sister and I cruised on a cheap cruise on Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas for $499. This was also a 4-night cruise to the Bahamas.

This cruise was one of the cheapest cruises that I could find for Carnival Cruise Line. We booked this cruise through a travel agent but found the cruise on Carnival's website.

This cruise costed right around $600 for 2 people sailing in an inside cabin including gratuities. Keep in mind we booked this cruise 2 weeks ago so I think that’s a fair price for 4-nights.

I was excited to see the cheap price sailing from Mobile given its proximity to my house. We are planning to drive to the port on the same day as the cruise departs since it’s a very quick drive for us.

I’m sure there are a few factors playing into this cheap pricing such as sailing during the upcoming peak of hurricane season. Schools are also starting back up in August so that is probably also contributing to the lower price.

I'll be curious to see what the sailing occupancy will be for this cruise. On our cheap Royal Caribbean cruise we found the ship to be sailing at 100% capacity - much to our surprise. A late summer cruise will have a different onboard vibe than our cheap cruise over spring break.

Expectations

Image

Let me start by saying: I’ve never been on a cruise that I didn’t enjoy. I have a hard time understanding how someone could go on a cruise and not have a good time!

That said some cruises have inherently better experiences than others.

But I’ll be honest - my expectations for this cruise are pretty low. I’m wondering if this will be one of those experiences where you get what you pay for - or maybe I’ll be pleasantly surprised.

To start the Carnival Ecstasy is going to be scrapped in October 2022. Being so close to her retirement I’m curious to see if the cruise ship is in bad condition.

The description on Carnival’s website even starts with “Carnival Ecstasy has the experience under her belt to ensure that you have an amazing cruise” which really sets the tone.

I don't expect Carnival Ecstasy to have all the bells and whistles like newer ships so I am trying to realistic of the onboard amenities and offerings.

It also seems like Carnival Cruise ships are infamous online for being tied to incidents in the news - like onboard fires brawls breaking out etc. Of course these are rare events and I’m sure our cruise will go off without a hitch.

When I initially found this cruise I googled the ship’s name and the first populated search was “Carnival Ecstasy death”...

Not necessarily what you want to see when you look up your cruise ship! I believe this incident was tied to a crew member having a mishap with elevator maintenance a few years prior.

I’ve also watched a few videos online with recent experiences on Carnival Ecstasy. To prepare I have been reading on a few forums about recent cruising experiences from past cruisers. Most seem to be pleased with their cruises on Carnival Ecstasy; some even note on the wonderful service and amenities given the ship's age and looming retirement.

Since this is a weekend cruise I expect it to be a party atmosphere with lots of people looking to have a good time. We are ready to kick back and let loose!

There’s been reports the ship has an unusual smell onboard. Since the ship is so close to retirement this doesn’t entirely surprise me but I am interested to see if this holds true.

Again I’ve never not enjoyed a cruise so I’m sure we will have a great time but I am going to keep my expectations within reason. You shouldn't book the cheapest cruise on the oldest ship in a cruise line's fleet and have unrealistically high expectations.

The Cruise

Image

For a cheap getaway cruise I’m looking forward to enjoying some delicious food and fun entertainment. I plan to kickback on the pool deck and enjoy a few cocktails.

Carnival Ecstasy has a Serenity Retreat which is an adults-only area. This sounds like a place I’d like to spend a lot of time!

The ship also has a RedFrog Rum Bar BlueIguana Tequila Bar and Alchemy Bar which all sound like great places to grab a fun cocktail. We aren’t purchasing a drink package since it was nearly the same price as the cruise and that doesn’t necessarily fit our travel budget. Hopefully the drinks don’t add up too quickly!

I loved Guy’s Burger Joint on my last Carnival cruise so I’ll be planning to have that for lunch one day.

The Punchliner Comedy Club was also a fun spot where my husband and I enjoyed live comedy every night on our last cruise. I’m excited to see what’s offered there.

We haven’t made any plans for our day in Cozumel although we’ve both recently been to Mexico. Since the cruise was so cheap I’d like to keep costs down so we might choose to simply walk around the port area.

It’s always fun to spend time with my sister and I’m excited to have this experience together!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcm5pdmFsLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDkvY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNlbGVicmF0aW9ucy1zZW5pb3Itb2ZmaWNlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Announces Carnival Celebration's Senior Officers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcm5pdmFsLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDkvY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNlbGVicmF0aW9ucy1zZW5pb3Itb2ZmaWNlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84948D00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcm5pdmFsLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDkvY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNlbGVicmF0aW9ucy1zZW5pb3Itb2ZmaWNlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWNyaXRpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2Fybml2YWwtb25ib2FyZC1jcmVkaXQtaG93LXRvLWdldC1pdC1hbmQtd2hlcmUtdG8tc3BlbmQtaXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get and Spend Carnival Cruise Onboard Credit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cruisecritic.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/carnival-onboard-credit-how-to-get-it-and-where-to-spend-it (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D849483A0>, 'Connection to www.cruisecritic.com timed out.
