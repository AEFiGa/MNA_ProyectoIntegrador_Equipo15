Austin Office Park,"Karlin Real Estate a Los Angeles-based firm with extensive holdings in the Austin area is planning a massive makeover for a 156-acre office campus in the northwest of the city that was once home to 3M.

The vacant complex has 1.1 million square feet of rentable space and is near the intersection of RM 2222 and RM 620. It will be renamed Highpoint at 2222 and Karlin hopes to land a single large tenant for the renovated campus according to the Austin Business Journal.

CBRE is handling leasing for the project.

Karlin plans to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars to just totally renovate and repurpose this campus” said Mike McGlashan the firm’s Austin-based vice president of acquisitions and development.

The property has been vacant since 3M moved out in 2019 and was once part of local developer Nate Paul’s crumbling empire World Class Holdings. Paul purchased the sprawling campus in 2017 with plans to renovate but defaulted on the loan two years later. Karlin acquired the debt and foreclosed in June 2021.

Karlin which currently owns about 4 million square feet of office space spread across 13 properties in and around the capital city is embroiled in another legal wrangle with Paul over control of Offices at Braker a portfolio of 11 properties in North Austin.

Karlin-owned shell company ATX Braker has been pursuing a foreclosure sale of the 45-acre office campus. ATX Braker issued an original $29 million mezzanine loan for the campus and later acquired a $63 million senior mortgage on the office park from JP Morgan.

Paul put the foreclosure on hold in July when an affiliate of World Class Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy — a common strategy of real estate debtors who are facing foreclosure and want to buy time for refinancing or sale.

A date of September 29 was finally set for the auction earlier this month but Paul could possibly still keep control of the properties. Since selling off his self-storage portfolio for more than half a billion dollars in March Paul has used the proceeds to buy up several former World Class assets at foreclosure sales.

“Yeah I’ve had some highs and some lows in there the reverse was a bit of a low but you know that’s how diving goes you win some you lose some.

“I’m delighted with how far I’ve come [this year overall]. I felt like I could of done better in there but you know it’s been a long stint for me I’ve been having back to back competitions and so I haven’t really had the rest in-between. It’s been great this year the best year by far for me so I can’t complain”

The day’s first final came in the earlier in the afternoon as Amy Rollinson teamed up with Desharne Bent-Ashmeil in the Women's 3m Synchro.

In the 2022 season the pair have built upon a National title netting experience at the World Championships and Commonwealth Games before coming so close incredibly to a first senior international medal as a couple on the European stage in Rome.



With their Forward 2 1/2 Somersaults 1 Twist Pike (5152B) in the penultimate round breaking 60 points the bronze medal position was with touching distance for Amy and Desharne. Ultimately however they finished a heart wrenching 0.30 points off the medals in fourth as the Swedish pairing pipped them in the rankings.

Reflecting on the performance Amy said: ""It's just us getting used to diving outdoors.

Jane' screenwriter explains why Demi Moore gave 'the performance of her career' in the 1997 military drama,"Demi Moore gets into fighting shape in G.I. Jane which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. (Photo: Courtesy Everett Collection)

Before it re-emerged as an Oscar night punchline — and a prelude to a slap that's still reverberating in Hollywood — G.I. Jane's primary pop culture legacy was a career-defining showcase for Demi Moore. Released 25 years ago on Aug. 22 1997 the Ridley Scott-directed military drama featured the Ghost star completely revamping her screen image bulking up her body and shaving her head to play Lt. Jordan O'Neil a military analyst who becomes the first female candidate to go through intensive basic training to join a Navy SEAL-like special ops team.

Although the movie itself received mixed reviews Moore's intense performance was largely praised. It also proved to be her last star turn for some time: The actress took a multi-year hiatus after G.I. Jane's release shifting her focus to raising her three daughters with then-husband Bruce Willis. She didn't appear in another mainstream studio movie until Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle six years later.

""It's the performance of her career"" G.I. Jane screenwriter David Twohy tells Yahoo Entertainment now. ""The movie rises or falls on her performance and that required her to have a total unflinching commitment to that part. And she had that commitment — I think she f***ing nailed it.""

In Twohy's ideal world G.I. Jane's only connection to the Oscars would have been a Best Actress nomination for Moore a quarter century ago. Instead the film is now part of a moment that's enshrined in Oscar infamy. At the 94th Academy Awards in March comedian Chris Rock introduced the nominees for Best Documentary and took the opportunity to address Best Actor nominee Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith. ""Jada I love ya. G.I. Jane 2 — can't wait to see it all right?"" the comedian said referencing the actress's bald head. (Pinkett Smith suffers from alopecia and has openly discussed her struggles with hair loss.) Smith then walked onstage and slapped Rock on camera.

""It was a G.I Jane joke"" the comic said after the King Richard star returned to his seat. ""Keep my wife's name out your f***ing mouth"" the actor responded. Smith remained in his seat for the rest of the telecast and later accepted his Best Actor statue declining to apologize to Rock. (Smith issued an apology the following day and released another apology on July 29. He also resigned from the Academy which later voted to ban him from attending the Oscars and other events for 10 years.)

""To me the joke was sort of a non-joke that was followed by some testosterone-fueled over reactionary bulls***"" Twohy says of the Oscar fracas during which G.I. Jane became collateral damage. ""I personally think that Jada should have flashed her own guns and taken it as a compliment because Demi looks great in the movie with her bald head and Jada looks great too. So where's the burn? Not only where's the joke but where's the burn? I don't get it."" At the same time he doesn't believe the movie itself has been impacted in a negative way. ""I'm assuming that my next residual check for G.I. Jane will double.""

Twohy's history with G.I. Jane dates back to 1995 when he found himself on a shortlist of writers brought in by Hollywood Pictures — one of the Walt Disney Company-owned labels that focused on grown-up fare — to work on a script that had originated with British writer Danielle Alexandra. Moore was already attached to the project at that point and had been impressed by Twohy's contributions to Harrison Ford's 1993 hit The Fugitive. ""I originally passed because I don't have a military background"" the writer explains. ""So the studio said 'Please go out and meet with Demi.' She was filming Striptease at the time we met in her trailer during her lunch break.""

During that lunchtime meeting Twohy remembers asking Moore one very important question. ""It was her idea to shave her head and I said: 'Do you know what kind of a skull you have? Do you have a good-looking skull? Because if not this could go bad quick.' She said: 'I don't know but I think I do! I've never seen it.' I was captivated by her and that was the point of the meeting. When I got back to L.A. I told the studio 'OK I'll do it.'""

Twohy turned in his first draft of G.I. Jane in Aug. 1995 a full two years before the film arrived in theaters. And those two years were filled with multiple rewrites plus a major third act overhaul that Scott demanded when he signed on to direct. ""It was one of the more torturous writing projects I've been involved with"" laughs Twohy whose other credits include a stint on the script for Kevin Costner's notorious 1995 bomb Waterworld and writing and directing all three entries in Vin Diesel's fan favorite Riddick trilogy — Pitch Black The Chronicles of Riddick and Riddick.

One of the first choices that Scott and Twohy faced was whether or not to enlist the U.S. military in bringing G.I. Jane to life. As Twohy recalls the director initially argued in favor of cooperation with the Navy hoping to use actual locations and technology. ""He loved the hovercrafts that the Navy had"" the writer says. ""He told me 'I can't get my hands on the hovercrafts without cooperation so we're going to cooperate!'""

But Scott's resolve wavered as the Navy demanded script changes and creative oversight. Twohy remembers the duo sitting in ""endless meetings"" where a rotating crew of bureaucrats raised objections to the amount of swearing in the script and the use of the SEALs name. (The fictional team in the movie is called the U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team.) ""After awhile we got to the point where we were like 'F*** the hovercrafts and f*** the Navy — we're doing it without cooperation.""

Twohy credits the always-resourceful Scott with figuring out a way to feature the Navy in the movie without their direct involvement. ""Ridley went down to Florida and found a beach venue that was directly opposite a Naval base"" the writer says. ""He realized 'If I set up on this beach and film seaward all those battleships and frigates and Navy activity is going to be in the background of my movie.' And that's the way we did it!""

While Twohy started work on the script knowing that he was tailoring the role of Jordan O'Neil to Moore the rest of the cast wasn't set in stone. In fact he initially wrote the unit's ranking officer Command Master Chief Jack Urgayle as an older character than the one eventually portrayed by a then-39-year-old Viggo Mortensen. ""That was a bit of a surprise"" he says of Mortensen's casting revealing that Harvey Keitel also wanted to play the role. ""Ridley approached Harvey for another part but he said 'No I want to play Master Chief.' Ridley informed him 'We've met some of those guys and they tend to skew young — you're too old for that part.' So Harvey declined to join the movie; he wanted Master Chief or nothing. That's when Viggo's name made its appearance.""

Twohy says that Mortensen came to set with the idea that Master Chief would be a D.H. Lawrence fan a running thread that sets up the emotional final scene between him and O'Neil. ""Viggo is a poet himself and I can only assume that Lawrence is one of his favorite poets. So he brought that to the table and incorporated it into the character."" Mortensen's relative youth also upped the intensity in the battle of wills he shared with Moore — a battle that takes a physical turn in one memorable scene where the two get into a fight that leaves her bloodied and bruised.

While Twohy wasn't on set the day that Moore and Mortensen went head-to-head he was given the scoop about the brawl afterwards. ""I heard that when Viggo puts her head through the door and throws her from inside the interrogation room to the outside area he was supposed to throw her into a pad that was on the door. But he threw her a little off and her head hit the door for real! They really got into it."" (Moore later showed off her battle scar during an appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman.)

Twohy also wasn't on set the day that Moore — and the rest of the crew — saw exactly what her skull looked like when it was shorn of hair. ""I saw behind the scenes footage later"" he recalls adding that Moore served as her own barber. ""I always assumed that Ridley would have filmed it in one take with six cameras but he kept stopping and starting! Demi would get three or four strokes of the razor in and he'd be like 'Stop stop! Are we good? How does the skull look?' When she got about 40% of her head shaved the whole crew broke out in applause. You can hear a lot of the military actors in the background yelling 'Hoo-yah hoo-yah!' It was a big f***ing deal; I would have loved to have been there.""

But the writer was present and accounted for when Scott filmed the scene that was intended to open G.I. Jane. ""Ridley's original idea was to start with an action sequence that showed that O'Neil's not just an intel officer but has athletic aspirations as well"" Twohy says about the discarded sequence which found Moore practicing a fast and furious Skeleton run at a Winter Olympics training facility in Lake Placid N.Y.

""He filmed this fantastic sequence where she's hurtling down the Skeleton course at 50 miles an hour with her coach barking in her ear the whole way"" he continues. ""Then she crashes and burns at the end because she's not taking his direction very well. That's one of her character flaws thinking 'I've got to do this my way' which is the opposite of teamwork."" (Although the Skeleton sequence was cut from the theatrical version of G.I. Jane it was later released on both the Laserdisc and DVD editions.)

While the alternate opening was eventually released Scott shot another ending for G.I. Jane that has only ever been seen by studio executives at Disney. Twohy says that the film's third act was always a sticking point for the director who wanted O'Neil to face real world combat at the end of basic training in the same way that Top Gun ended with Tom Cruise's Maverick flying into an actual battle with hostile enemy fighters. (The original Top Gun was directed by Scott's brother Tony Scott who died by suicide in 2012.)

""Ridley always had it in his head that we were going to do the same thing"" Twohy recalls adding that his own preference was to make surviving basic training a life or death situation of O'Neil. But Scott ultimately won that battle and the writer scripted the ending seen in the film where she and her fellow trainees are dispatched to recover weapons-grade plutonium from the Libyan desert. On the advice of the film's military adviser ex-Navy SEAL Harry Humphries Scott filmed an ending where O'Neil was shot and killed by a sniper in addition to a finale where she survives the mission. Disney executives were shown both endings and went with the happier version that general audiences saw when the film premiered.

""It was a cautionary ending — just stark as f***"" Twohy says of the alternate finale. ""The story that we told was telling the parents of America that they have to be ready for their daughters to come home in body bags. Ridley and I talked about it and I said 'I don't think it's gratifying but I can see how this might be an apt ending if we're being totally realistic about this.' But I'm assuming the studio stepped in and said 'Nope.'""

Thanks to Moore's still-potent star power G.I. Jane topped the box office its opening weekend but the mixed critical response ate into its earnings and the film ended its run just shy of $50 million. Looking back Twohy believes that the vitriol that surrounded Moore's previous film Striptease impacted the way that G.I. Jane was greeted by reviewers and audiences alike.

""Striptease came out while we were in production and the stink was in the air"" he says of that 1996 flop. ""I don't think it was fairly received and Striptease had a lot to do with it because it was a truly bad movie. She should have been nominated for G.I. Jane and I think she would have been too if not for Striptease. That tainted her chances and maybe everyone's chances.""

Over the ensuing 25 years though Twohy says that he's received messages from many viewers — including a number of female military officers — who give the movie a big ""Hoo-rah."" ""I do hear from women in combat settings who say 'That movie is why I'm here.' I also hear from workout people too! They're like 'Anytime I want to get pumped up for a good workout I watch G.I. Jane.' I think it has a powerful message that still resonates today and I'm sure that a lot of women in the military go through the same things that we portrayed. I don't think misogyny has gone away in the military.""

Labor asked whether he had any concerns about the hiring process given he was asked to sign off on Barilaro’s appointment a week after the former deputy premier had already signed a contract in June.

“Yes I do” Smith said.

“I reflected that to my other independent colleagues on the panel. We were both bypassed that’s my view and I wasn’t happy about it.”

Labor asked if he felt “used” in the process.

“I’m no stranger to politics even though I’ve been distant from it for some time” he said.

“You have to say that having been through all the other processes... to get a note one day saying ‘please sign here’ - some two months after you’d had the interview anyway - seems to me to be used or being taken for granted.”

He said the trade commissioner roles were important for NSW and it was crucial to put the right people in them.

Labor: In relation to those standards of fairness openness transparency would you agree that they failed in this particular instance?

Smith: Well it’s certainly not just me saying it an independent person has came to come to that conclusion.

He said the Graeme Head review - which found the process was not conducted at arm’s length from government - had articulated the issues “far more clearly” than what he could.

Greg Abbott doubles down on busing migrants to NYC amid feud with Mayor Eric Adams,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott defended sending buses of migrants from the Texas-Mexico border to Democrat-led cities amid a feud with New York City Mayor Eric Adams who accused Abbott of using migrants as “political pawns” amid a crisis on the southern border.

Abbott and Adams spoke with ""Nightline"" co-anchor Byron Pitts in interviews that aired on Wednesday where Adams criticized the Republican governor for not coordinating the arrivals of migrants with NYC officials and Abbott doubled down on his policy to bus migrants out of Texas.

“We've got to secure our border because the Biden administration is not securing it” Abbott said. “And then the reason why we began putting people on buses in the first place is because the Biden administration they were literally dumping migrants off in small little towns of 10 or 25000 people and they were completely overwhelmed.”

Meanwhile Adams criticized Abbott for not coordinating with NYC officials as buses of migrants arrived over the past two weeks.

“It’s the worst type of politics” Adams said. “It’s hateful politics to raise his national profile and you know what you should not be doing it by taking away the respect and dignity of people who are in need.”

According to Adams more than 6000 migrants seeking asylum have arrived in NYC since May – many of whom were sent there due to Abbott’s busing policy.

Adams said during a June 21 press conference that the city will find shelter for migrants arriving from Texas under the state's ""right to shelter"" law.

But as thousands of asylum seekers arrived in New York City over the past couple of months the shelter system has been strained and city officials acknowledged that the NYC Department of Social Services violated New York City’s right to shelter mandate when it failed to place four families in shelters overnight.

Asked about Adams’ accusation that the policy to move migrants to New York City is political showmanship and “un-American” Abbott accused Adams of “playing politics” and called him a “hypocrite.”

“He's also being a hypocrite because New York City is a self-declared ‘sanctuary city’” Abbott said. “And so why he's ever complaining for one moment about these people being bused into a city goes against his own self-declaration of being a sanctuary city.” The term “sanctuary city” refers to municipalities like New York City that are willing to defy federal immigration laws in order to protect undocumented immigrants.

According to an Aug. 5 statement from Abbott’s office more than 6500 migrants also have been sent on buses to Washington D.C. and now New York City.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has requested help from the National Guard to deal with the crisis.

A defense official told ABC News in a statement on Aug. 5 that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “has declined to approve the DCHSEMA request for DCNG to provide personnel and the DC Armory to assist the NGO SAMU First Response with transportation and reception of migrants arriving in the DC area.”

“We have determined providing this support would negatively impact the readiness of the DCNG and have negative effects on the organization and members” the official said adding that there is sufficient funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program to address the crisis.

But Bowser renewed her call for help from the National Guard later that week.

“We need help from our federal partners as we seek to stabilize and manage our operating environment in this critical moment” Bowser tweeted on Aug. 11. “I have been honored to work with the men and women of the DC National Guard many times and today we renewed our request for their assistance.”

Asked if he may also request help from the National Guard Adams said “We're going to do everything that's possible at this time.”

“We believe that we can continue to carry out our moral and legal responsibility” he added. “We are calling on Washington. It is Washington's purpose to assist the states and cities during these difficult times. So we are looking for help from Washington D.C.”

Adams urged Abbott to coordinate with NYC officials as buses continue to arrive in the city.

Asked if he had spoken directly with Abbott Adams said ""no I have not.""

“He should have picked the phone up and we should communicate because as I stated this is a crisis” Adams said.

Pressed on whether he would work with Adams to coordinate migrant arrivals Abbott said that he previously sent Adams a letter and urged him to visit Texas to witness the “chaos” of the migrant crisis in the state firsthand but Adams did not take him up on the offer.

“Before we began busing illegal immigrants up to New York it was just Texas and Arizona that bore the brunt of all of the chaos and all the problems that come with it. Now the rest of America is understanding exactly what is going on” Abbott said.

The feud between Adams and Abbott comes amid a heated policy battle between the Republican governor who is currently seeking reelection and the Biden administration over a surge of migrant arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border.

What happened after they arrived?,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

Early Saturday morning the room on the fourth floor of the Washington DC church is full. It’s not yet 7 a.m. and already about sixty migrants mostly men and a handful of families with children some women breastfeeding sit around nine round tables. Their scant belongings—keepsakes of the homes they had left behind and tokens of solidarity from strangers they encountered along the way—are preserved inside transparent Ziplocs and white trash bags. After a 1700-mile 40-hour journey from Texas two of the more than 150 buses transporting migrants that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has sent to Washington DC had arrived at Union Station at dawn. One woman approaches me to ask where she can take a shower telling me she really needs to clean up. Another wonders if she can have a new pair of shoes because the cheap rubber sandals on her feet are falling apart. Some people need diapers and ointment for their babies; others ask around for some medicine that could relieve a headache.

David Swanson a 60-year-old compliance manager with the Human Rights Campaign finance department volunteers at the church every other weekend. (Mother Jones is not disclosing the location of the church or the migrants’ full names to protect their identities.) Since the church started receiving migrants in late May over a month after they began arriving in the city he has met people from all over the world—Venezuela Guatemala Honduras Haiti and even Afghanistan. During one of his shifts a volunteer who happened to be a pediatrician noticed a woman who had surgical staples all over her chest. Swanson recalls that she had been shot many times then hospitalized but left her home country before she could get them removed. Another man had told him that he felt “a little bit like a prisoner” when he saw his final destination—Nashville Tennessee—fly by the window as his bus raced towards the east coast without making a stop.

This Saturday in August Swanson is cooking breakfast for a group he had anticipated would number about 23 people. The gathering had more than doubled and it turned out to be the biggest group the church had welcomed in a while. Dressed in an apron Swanson started at 5 a.m. and prepared 130 eggs and eight rolls of pork sausage to be served with slices of melon mandarin oranges white bread coffee and apple juice. Still he worries there might not be enough food for everyone. “Luckily we had a lot of leftover eggs from last week” he tells me. Nearby a young man thanks a volunteer saying he hadn’t had a proper meal in several days. A mother breastfeeding a cheerful eight-month-old boy tells me she is happy to drink coffee for the first time in more than a week. Like so many people in the room she and her husband hope to leave soon for New York.

“We mostly stay out of the way and let them do their work” Swanson says of the volunteers with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network a coalition of about 20 grassroots groups from the DMV area and countless individuals who have mobilized to receive the buses at Union Station. “They work like a machine” he says coordinating with churches and other faith-based organizations to provide assistance and orientation to the migrants.

The migrants most of whom came from Venezuela are unaware that they have become the most recent pawns in a political game carried out by Republican governors. The first bus from Texas arrived in DC on April 13 with about 30 passengers on board. It was part of what Abbott described as a “voluntary transportation” plan but what advocates and the White House have dubbed a “publicity stunt.” The Texas governor said he was responding to the Biden administration’s move to rescind a Trump-era policy that relied on a public health order to summarily expel migrants and asylum seekers coming to the US-Mexico border. (The policy remains in place pending further litigation.) “By busing migrants to Washington DC the Biden Administration will be able to more immediately meet the needs of the people they are allowing to cross our border” Abbott who is seeking a third term in office said in a statement at the time. “Texas should not have to bear the burden of the Biden Administration’s failure to secure our border.”

“Texas should not have to bear the burden of the Biden Administration’s failure to secure our border.”

Since April Abbott has dispatched a total of 6500 migrants to the Nation’s Capital which has scrambled to try to deal with the arrivals. In early August Texas also started sending migrants to New York where they’re being dropped off at the Port Authority bus terminal. So far the Texas Division of Emergency Management has spent millions of dollars in taxpayer money to charter the buses. A crowdfunding campaign organized by the governor’s office to help offset the costs had raised $167828 as of August 17. In May the Republican governor of Arizona Doug Ducey also began to bus migrants to DC—costing the state at least $3 million. The hostile practice has received criticism even from some Republicans who have called it a gimmick and a “cute photo-op.” The goal Hidetaka Hirota associate professor of history at the University of California Berkeley and author of Expelling the Poor: Atlantic Seaboard States and the Nineteenth-Century Origins of American Immigration Policy writes in the Washington Post is to “embarrass pro-immigration politicians and create the appearance of chaos to justify cruel policies.”

Among the volunteers at the church is Diana Fula a Colombian-born case manager for social services at Ayuda a nonprofit organization helping low-income immigrants. She wears a bright blue t-shirt that reads “Melt ICE” in reference to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the agency that detains immigrants. She addresses some of the migrants by “compa” a shorthand for compañero or companion. Fula helps sort through the pile of donated clothes the church has collected some of which were originally meant for Afghan refugees and now fill racks and boxes in a large empty space on the third floor of the church building. “Families with kids first” she says in Spanish as people start lining up in the balcony.

After breakfast Fula tells everyone it’s time to start the intake process. About six volunteers collect information about the migrants’ country of origin date of birth special circumstances (LGBTQ+ pregnancy chronic illness) final destination and point of contact. In a sunny corner of the room telephone numbers for organizations in places such as Wisconsin Florida Massachusetts Chicago Georgia and Nebraska are listed on a whiteboard. Migrants have received cell phones used by ICE to track them Fula explains and she might need to follow up so they don’t miss their check-in appointments and immigration court dates in the future. When a man asks her about the New York address on his papers she urges him to confirm that he has the correct direction to a men’s shelter. “Sometimes immigration [officials] will put addresses that don’t even exist” she notes.

The migrants Fula says “are desperate to save their lives.” And the lives of their families. Five years ago Esaviel a slim-built 39-year-old Venezuelan wearing a t-shirt with the words “always courage” traveled to Brazil to try to provide for his now 11-year-old daughter who had been diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes. But work proved scarce. The family then moved to Colombia where Esaviel’s daily pay as a construction worker was worth a month’s salary in Venezuela. He invested much of his savings into buying tools which he then sold before leaving for the United States. “I came here for my daughter” he says showing me a piece of paper that details her medical condition. He has been carrying that paper for 21 days. “I want her to have a normal life.”

The buses to the DC have been arriving almost every day of the week sometimes multiple times a day and often early in the morning and late at night. According to volunteer groups only between 10 to 15 percent of migrants actually choose to stay in the DMV area. For those who are lucky the “free ride” might get them closer to their desired destination perhaps where family members await—whether in New York New Jersey Florida or Michigan.

Some larger organizations like the international humanitarian nonprofit SAMU First Response which received a $1 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have been designated to provide immediate assistance at Union Station. But community groups and volunteers have had to step in to fill the gaps. By July at the peak of arrivals two to five buses arrived on a daily basis and volunteers worked around the clock to send dozens of people to their next stops says Ashley Tjhung an organizer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network. (In a few months the coalition’s expenses have soared to $300000 to cover food housing transportation and medical assistance.)

Those staying in DC have spent nights outside the station or in shelters where bed space is limited. Some are put in hotels. But without being enrolled in the Department of Human Services system they lack a permanent address and don’t get assigned case managers to help them access basic services. “We have a network of volunteers who host migrants long-term in their homes and have been doing so for months” Tjhung says adding that the network also helps people make rent get groceries and find transportation to ICE appointments.

“We’re calling on the mayor to change her stance and live up to DC values as a sanctuary city.”

But volunteers also know the workload is not sustainable in the long run. Advocates point to one potential model in the city of San Antonio which established a FEMA-funded migrant resource center last month. “We recognize that these nonprofits are understandably strained and simply cannot be expected to carry this responsibility alone” DC’s Attorney General Karl A. Racine Tweeted last week when announcing a new grant program. “The biggest issue we’re facing now is the lack of response from the DC government itself” Tjhung says. “We’re calling on the mayor to change her stance and live up to DC values as a sanctuary city.”

For her part DC Mayor Muriel Bowser recently asked the federal government to deploy 150 members of the National Guard to respond to what she called a “growing humanitarian crisis.” The Pentagon denied the request. “I have got to deploy the resources that I need to handle it” Bowser said. “And we need our National Guard. If we were a state I would have already… deployed the National Guard. We also need a federal site. If there are going to be ongoing busloads of people who are stopping here on their way to where they’re going—which is not here—we need a site that the NGOs can use to make that… stop as humane as possible for people who are fleeing horrendous circumstances. In many cases those people are boarding buses having been lied to about what’s going to be on the other end and then they’re still not where they want to be. So we really need federal coordination.”

I got to Union Station just before 10 p.m. earlier in the week arriving around the same time as a group of about 17 migrants entered the main hall. The men who appeared to be mostly in their late teens or early twenties had just gotten off a bus and carried brown envelopes. They huddled together as they waited to give four SAMU volunteers their information. Some were making calls to family members and eating pizzas the volunteers had brought. “They’re being thrown back and forth” Diego Anjos a Brazilian pastor with the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God told me explaining that he had decided to go to the station to see how he could help.

Jesus a 21-year-old from Venezuela had been traveling for nearly six weeks since July 1. That was the first time he had left the country. Although he had finished his third year in law school he saw no prospects in crisis-ridden Venezuela. “There if you have money you eat if not you don’t” he said. In a backpack he acquired along the way Jesus carried a pair of sneakers and socks coins from the countries he had crossed and a letter from his eight-year-old brother. He had carefully placed the paper inside two plastic bags but it had been reduced to shreds perhaps a casualty of the river crossing. His brother’s drawing of a heart and an arrow were still visible.

“People have seen some unimaginable heartbreaking things” Reverend Lisa Ahuja from a DC-based church that welcomes migrants says. The church has hung a big map so that people can talk about their plans and future destinations. It has also started offering Spanish language worship services on weekends. Sometimes migrants ask her to pray for their family members or those who had died along the journey. “While they seem hopeful for the life ahead of them they are also longing and grieving for the life they had” Rev. Ahuja says explaining she worries about the migrants’ mental health needs and hopes to apply for a grant so she can hire a social worker and a therapist. “This [work] takes half of my time” she says. “It’s not my full-time job; I still have to run a church visit the dying… But I know this is the most important thing we can be doing.”

“While they seem hopeful for the life ahead of them they are also longing and grieving for the life they had.”

“They’re our neighbors“ Rev. Ahuja adds “our community members now.”

On a hot beautiful August Thursday Daniele sits across from me outside a Gregorys Coffee downtown. “The heat doesn’t bother me” she tells me in Spanish her eyebrows and manicure impeccably done and her dark curly hair tied on top of her head with a scarf. “I’m used to it.” It’s been a little over a month since Daniele who asked me not to use her real name because she has a pending application for asylum arrived in one of the hundreds of buses from Texas. The 26-year-old from Venezuela appears in awe of how clean and well-kept the public spaces in the city are and how multicultural it is. She never imagined that she would end up in Washington DC but now because of the Texas governor’s political stunt she’s calling it home.

In Venezuela Daniele served in the military and dreamed of becoming a Navy pilot. But as the political crisis in the country worsened she decided to abandon her military career and migrate to Ecuador. “It’s very sad to see so many of your dreams going down the drain for circumstances that are outside of your control” she says. “I planned all my life and none of it came to fruition. Look at where I am now. I’m adrift.” The xenophobia in Ecuador she says made her life harder—rental listings explicitly stated they didn’t accept Venezuelans and visas that cost five times more than for other nationalities. So on May 20 she began the journey to the United States with a group of 18 people.

Crossing the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia was the hardest stretch. She spent three days and two nights in the jungle. “When you get to the jungle there are more than 500 people searching for the same dream” she says. “And it’s not the American dream. It’s a dream of giving your family something better. You know that something can happen to you but for your family nothing else matters. You risk everything you have and everything you are.”

Along the way Daniele says she slept in the streets and got extorted kidnapped and detained. After walking for three days from one Mexican town to the next she arrived at Piedras Negras on the border with Texas. As she crossed the river with water up to her neck she cried and felt safe for the first time in a while. “From the moment I stepped on US soil” she says “it was as if a weight was lifted off my shoulders.” After being taken to a border facility for processing Daniele was released and spent one night at a shelter where they told her about the bus to DC on which she estimates she traveled with about 70 other migrants.

Daniele arrived in DC on the night of July 5 and connected with a church where she met a woman who lives alone and welcomed her into her home. “She’s like a second mother” she says. “We help each other a lot and keep each other company.” Some Wednesdays Daniele volunteers at the church that first received her helping the migrants who continue to arrive. She knows she has a long road ahead of her. She isn’t allowed to work and it may take months for her asylum application to go through. But for the time being she has found peace. “I want to stay here” she tells me. “I’m happy where I am.”

As I reflect on the people I had encountered—Daniele the eight-month-old baby and his mother the young men eating pizza at Union Station—I think about all the uncertainty that will follow them and the scores of other migrants who were now in buses bound for DC or New York. How long will it take for them to get back on their feet? Whose generosity might they have to rely on next? Then I remember Esaviel whose daughter’s survival kept him going. “Someone who’s desperate doesn’t make it through” he told me. “You have to have a strong mind.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlL21vdGhlcnMtYWdhaW5zdC1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1wYWMtMTczODI1NTgucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How one Texas mom launched the political crusade against Greg Abbott,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.chron.com/politics/article/mothers-against-greg-abbott-pac-17382558.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlL21vdGhlcnMtYWdhaW5zdC1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1wYWMtMTczODI1NTgucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

1. Seagen after $42M victory suffers loss in ADC patent feud with Daiichi

Daiichi Sankyo has come out victorious in an ongoing legal tussle with Seagen around an antibody-drug conjugate patent. An arbitrator ruled in favor of the Japanese pharma. The decision comes shortly after Seagen prevailed in a separate Texas lawsuit in which the U.S. biotech was awarded $41.8 billion for Daiichi’s past infringement of the patent.

2. China's Jemincare nabs $650M biobucks pact with Roche's Genentech for prostate cancer hopeful

Roche’s Genentech put down $60 million upfront with an additional $590 million in biobucks to purchase Chinese company Jemincare’s androgen receptor degrader JMKX002992. Roche is angling the protein degrader for patients with treatment-resistant prostate cancer.

3. AbbVie stops 2nd CD47 study early dropping out of AML race it joined in $2B biobuck deal

Back in 2020 AbbVie paid I-Mab $180 million upfront and dangled $1.74 billion in milestones for ex-China rights to the latter’s CD47 drug lemzoparlimab. Now AbbVie has canned a second early-stage trial which tested the drug in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s Vidaza with or without AbbVie and Roche’s Venclexta in acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

In 2019 government lawyers in Oklahoma called Johnson & Johnson the “kingpin” of the opioid crisis likening the pharmaceutical giant to a Mexican drug cartel.

In 2021 New York’s top law enforcement figure declared that opioids “wreaked havoc on countless communities” and that Johnson & Johnson “helped fuel this fire.”

But Illinois politicians keep taking campaign money from Johnson & Johnson and other companies paying $26 billion to settle lawsuits that accused them of fueling the opioid crisis campaign-finance records show.

Illinois Senate President Don Harmon D-Oak Park is the most prominent among them. Harmon has accepted these campaign contributions tied to the companies that have been painted by government lawyers across the nation as corporate bad guys in the opioid crisis:



$2000 last September from a Johnson & Johnson political action committee.

$2000 in 2020 from a Johnson & Johnson fund.

$2000 in December from Fidelity Consulting Group LLC a Rosemont lobbying firm that lobbies for Johnson & Johnson.

$7500 over the past two years from firms that lobby on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America a Washington D.C. trade group to which Johnson & Johnson and other opioid sellers belong.

Harmon won’t talk about taking campaign contributions from companies linked to the opioid crisis.

Opioid cash won’t ‘compromise his values’

Asked about why he keeps taking that money a spokesman for the Illinois Democrat rather than answering questions says: “Over two decades in office President Harmon has tirelessly fought for progressive policies that make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share lower health care costs for working families and protect consumers from abuse. No donation from any source will ever compromise his values.”

Asked about its political contributions a Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman points to a statement on the company’s website that says: “We do not expect candidates who receive contributions from our employee political action committee or our company to agree with our positions on all or any specific policy issues. Rather we seek to support candidates who recognize the importance of medical innovation in improving lives and that a fair market-based system provides the best environment for continued innovation. We also seek to support candidates who recognize the importance of broad access to quality affordable health care.”

Earlier this year Johnson & Johnson was among four companies that agreed to pay $26 billion to settle lawsuits that accused them of making money off the highly addictive painkillers while ignoring the health and well-being of users.

Hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths nationwide have been reported in recent years including according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 75000 opioid-related deaths from mid-2020 to mid-2021.

In Cook County more than 10000 deaths since 2016 have been linked to opioid overdoses. Statewide the number is nearly 23000 from 2008 through 2021.

Opioid payout coming to Illinois

State governments are among those that stand to get a piece of the $26 billion settlement — with an estimated $760 million destined for Illinois — to put toward drug-abuse treatment and prevention.

At a news conference last month Harmon’s fellow Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker talked about how that money will be handled and called the opioid crisis “one of the most disturbing examples of corporate greed and medical mismanagement in human history.”

Among those involved in the settlement Johnson & Johnson manufactured opioids and Cardinal Health McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen distributed the narcotic painkillers.

Under the settlement each of those companies will pay out billions of dollars. Johnson & Johnson — which like the others who settled rather than face trial hasn’t acknowledged any wrongdoing — also agreed to stop selling opioids in the United States.

Harmon who was elected Senate president in 2020 got a $2000 campaign contribution from McKesson in 2021.

The same year the company also gave $750 to state Rep. Barbara Hernandez D-Aurora. Hernandez who didn’t respond to calls or emails seeking comment was appointed to the Legislature in 2019 when Pritzker tapped her predecessor to head the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

Harmon who’s been in the General Assembly since 2003 accepted $250 from Cardinal Health in 2004 according to Illinois State Board of Elections records that show he’s gotten a total of about $150000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career.

Welch among pols taking opioid-tied money

Campaign-finance records also show:

Welch also got $750 in 2020 from McKesson. Welch and his aides would not answer questions about those contributions.

Altogether since 1994 Illinois politicians’ campaign funds collectively have gotten about $450000 from the four companies involved in the opioid settlement including about $360000 from Johnson & Johnson.

The pharmaceutical research and manufacturers group gave more than $300000 over the past two decades to Illinois politicians including nearly $140000 to campaign funds that were controlled by Welch’s predecessor former House Speaker Michael Madigan. Sarah Sutton a spokeswoman for the trade group says: “We engage with policymakers from both sides of the aisle who have a wide array of health care opinions and priorities.”

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul whose office is overseeing litigation in Illinois against the pharmaceutical industry took a $1000 campaign contribution from the pharma trade group in 2006 and $500 from Johnson & Johnson in 2015 both while he was in the General Assembly. Elected to his current post in 2018 he took contributions during that campaign from pharmaceutical firms including $500 from AbbVie.

AbbVie also gave pols money

Last month AbbVie which is based in North Chicago agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits over how its Allergan unit which it bought in 2020 marketed opioids.

Teva Pharmaceuticals which bought part of Allergan in 2016 announced a settlement agreement last month that could see it pay more than $4 billion to settle claims over opioids.

Harmon has gotten $25000 in campaign contributions from AbbVie since 2013 including $5000 in June and $15000 in 2021 records show.

AbbVie has given Welch $21500 including $5000 in June and $15000 in 2021 records show.

AbbVie which like Teva is a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America the trade group that has given heavily to Illinois politicians gave $1000 to then-state Rep. Christian Mitchell in 2018. After Pritzker took office in early 2019 he named Mitchell as one of his deputy governors.

Mitchell also got a $500 campaign contribution in 2015 from Fidelity Consulting Group. Neither of the lobbyists who run the company returned calls or emails.

Asked about the contributions Mitchell’s response was “Let me talk to my team see if it’s appropriate” to discuss this issue “and get back to you.” He didn’t.

Fidelity gave $1000 in 2021 to state Rep. Robyn Gabel D-Evanston who also got $500 from Johnson & Johnson in December.

Gabel also took $500 in 2016 from Purdue Pharma. The company long run by members of the billionaire Sackler family pleaded guilty in 2007 and 2020 to criminal charges stemming from marketing practices that “downplayed” the addiction risks of the opioid OxyContin.

Gabel has worked in public health for years.

“I’ve worked with pharmaceutical companies around immunization issues for many years for children’s immunizations” Gabel says. “So they throw me a little bit of money once in a while.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL3VzLWRydWctcHJpY2luZy1yZWZvcm0taGVyZS1lZmZlY3RzLXdvbnQtYmUtZmVsdC1zb21lLXRpbWUtYW5hbHlzdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IRA's drug price reforms likely to be credit negative for pharma,"The Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—rebuked by trade groups and Big Pharma CEOs alike—has officially flown Capitol Hill and been signed into law by President Joe Biden. While it will take several years for the sweeping law’s drug pricing provisions to materialize the legislation offers the U.S. a chance to make good on decades of talk about slashing prescription drug costs.

Drugmakers’ recent reactions to the rules aren’t surprising. Nevertheless industry-side brouhaha about price controls has some merit Moody’s Investors Service analysts wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

In fact the drug pricing provisions tucked into the IRA could eventually have a credit-lowering effect on the industry at large because pharma will largely bear the brunt of the changes the analysts said—despite the fact that several of those measures won’t come into effect for “four or more years.”

For example the IRA provisions that empower Medicare to haggle over certain drug costs and cap drug price increases to the rate of inflation are expected to save the U.S. government $164 billion over 10 years the Moody’s team said citing estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

That will likely translate to price reductions on “some products” and “more limited price growth on others” the analysts explained.

Medicare’s ability to negotiate certain drug costs will have the “largest impact” on the industry the Moody’s team said. The CBO figures that measure will save the U.S. $102 billion over 10 years with cost “generally borne by the industry” the Moody’s team added.

The law will empower Medicare to negotiate prices for 10 medicines in 2026 which will increase to 60 by 2029. In 2026 and 2027 Medicare will only oversee Part D drug prices but in 2028 it could also negotiate prices in Part B.

It’s not clear exactly which drugs will end up on the bargaining table though some potential candidates include Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer’s Eliquis Eli Lilly’s diabetes meds Trulicity and Jardiance AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica plus Gilead Sciences’ HIV therapy Biktarvy.

Aside from price negotiations tethering drug price hikes to the inflation rate should lead to some $62 billion in federal savings CBO estimates as quoted by Moody’s.

Further the Medicare Part D rework expected to cap out-of-pocket spending for seniors will also be “substantially borne by the industry.”

BMS’ Revlimid AbbVie and J&J’s Imbruvica and Pfizer’s Ibrance and Xtandi are “most likely to be hurt by a redesign of Medicare Part D” because they have “high spending tied more to their high prices than to their wide usage” Moody’s said.

How the law squeezes individual companies remains to be seen the analysts said. Broadly speaking however drugmakers with more U.S.-focused operations such as Amgen AbbVie and Gilead “may have higher exposure.” Companies with lower exposure include ex-U.S. outfits like Novartis Sanofi and AstraZeneca plus those with substantial businesses outside their pharma units.

One unexpected side effect of the law? The legislation could prompt an uptick in M&A the analysts said explaining that “[r]ising exposure to this social risk will represent an overhang for the industry and is likely to continue to help drive acquisition activity.”

What’s more the government’s estimated savings will grow over time “creating a long-term challenge for the pharmaceutical industry.”

Related FTC puts drugmaker and PBM rebates in the crosshairs over mounting insulin prices

While Biden’s signing of the IRA this week has given pharma a bloody nose many others including the president himself have suggested the law’s drug pricing provisions were a long time coming.

“I got here as a 29-year-old kid” Biden said in remarks published after signing the IRA. “We were promising to make sure that Medicare would have the power to negotiate lower drug prices back then—back then.“

Now with Medicare’s negotiating power locked into place “seniors are going to pay less for their prescription drugs while we’re changing circumstances for people on Medicare by putting a cap—a cap of a maximum of $2000 a year—on their prescription drug costs no matter what the reason for those prescriptions are” the president continued.

“This is a Godsend to many families and so so long overdue” Biden said.

Some drug pricing experts have also shared positive outlooks like Stacie Dusetzina Ph.D. associate professor of health policy and Ingram associate professor of cancer research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

In a recent email to Fierce Pharma she described the law’s drug pricing measures as “good for Medicare beneficiaries and for taxpayers who fund the Medicare benefit.”

“Though some are disappointed that these provisions apply only to Medicare it is important to realize that this bill substantially improves the health benefits for 48 million people in our county” she added. “I think that is a really big deal.”

Still it’s important to note that with four years to go before many of the IRA’s drug cost provisions take effect the industry has plenty of time to throw a legal counterpunch.

Further the pharma sector could angle to influence the rulemaking process and sue to challenge the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ rollout of regulations and it might also attempt to ""game"" the Medicare negotiation process itself Rachel Sachs a law professor at the Washington University in St. Louis wrote in a recent HealthAffairs summary of the bill’s drug pricing elements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2ViaW90ZWNoLmNvbS9iaW90ZWNoL2N1cmlzLWdldHMtZ3JlZW4tbGlnaHQtZmRhLWxpZnRzLWNsaW5pY2FsLWhvbGQtbHltcGhvbWEtdHJpYWwtdGhvdWdoLXBhcnRpYWwtaG9sZC1sZXVrZW1pYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA lifts clinical hold on Curis' phase 1/2 lymphoma trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/curis-gets-green-light-fda-lifts-clinical-hold-lymphoma-trial-though-partial-hold-leukemia on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2ViaW90ZWNoLmNvbS9iaW90ZWNoL2N1cmlzLWdldHMtZ3JlZW4tbGlnaHQtZmRhLWxpZnRzLWNsaW5pY2FsLWhvbGQtbHltcGhvbWEtdHJpYWwtdGhvdWdoLXBhcnRpYWwtaG9sZC1sZXVrZW1pYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL3NldGJhY2stbHVuZGJlY2stY2dycC1taWdyYWluZS1kcnVnLXZ5ZXB0aS1oaXRzLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1zbmFnLXNhbGVzLXN0aWxsLWRvdWJsZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lundbeck's CGRP migraine drug Vyepti hits trial snag,"Amid growing competition within the CGRP inhibitor class of migraine drugs Lundbeck’s Vyepti has hit a setback in its market expansion plan.

Vyepti failed to significantly outdo placebo at reducing monthly migraine days in a phase 3 trial called Sunlight Lundbeck disclosed (PDF) Wednesday alongside its second-quarter financial results.

The migraine prevention trial was conducted mostly in China and enrolled patients with a combined diagnosis of chronic migraine and medication overuse headache. The study was originally designed as an “accelerated path” to launch in China Lundbeck said. But now the company is forced to rely on another trial coded Sunrise going back to its “base strategy” for a regulatory pathway across Asia which also includes China Johan Luthman Ph.D. Lundbeck’s head of R&D said during its earnings call Wednesday.

“We built a very aggressive trial for exploring what is possible for China” Luthman said.

Luthman attributed the flop to the trial’s relatively small size of 182 patients and an unexpectedly strong performance from the placebo group. Occasional high placebo responses are not completely unexpected in pain trials he added. Vyepti showed a numeric advantage over placebo in Sunlight but failed to meet statistical significance.

Related Lundbeck cuts 300 jobs to fuel Vyepti growth as CGRP migraine competition heats up

The Sunrise trial is much bigger with a target enrollment of 513 chronic migraine patients but not requiring simultaneous diagnosis of medication overuse headache. Lundbeck plans to use it for approvals in China Japan and Korea. The trial is enrolling well despite COVID-related challenges in China Luthman said adding that the timeline could be hard to predict because randomization is based on headache events.

Separately Lundbeck unveiled a phase 4 trial called Resolution. Similar to the failed Sunlight study Resolution will evaluate Vyepti as a migraine preventive in patients with both migraine and medication overuse headache. But the new trial aims to recruit around 570 patients.

Vyepti’s latest hiccup comes as competition among CGRP migraine drugs intensifies. Besides self-administered injectables such as Amgen’s Aimovig and Eli Lilly’s Emgality newer orals like Biohaven’s—soon to be Pfizer’s thanks to a proposed $11.6 billion acquisition—Nurtec ODT and AbbVie’s Qulipta are quickly gaining market shares.

Vyepti is different in that it’s an infusion and Lundbeck is counting on its fast onset of action to attract patients with more severe migraine. Approved by the FDA in February 2020 Vyepti sales jumped 120% year-over-year in the first half of 2022 reaching DKK 390 million ($53 million) including DKK 220 million in the second quarter.

Yet that sales figure is no comparison to Nurtec’s $194 million for the second quarter alone. Nonetheless Lundbeck CEO Deborah Dunsire lauded Vyepti as an “increasing contributor to growth” for the Danish company.

In the U.S. migraine prevention market Vyepti has reached 4.7% market share and the number of patients receiving repeated doses is also on the rise Dunsire said on Wednesday’s call.

Vyepti also got its European Commission go-ahead in January. Lundbeck recently launched the drug in Australia Singapore and Switzerland and expects additional rollouts in eight markets this year.

Overall Lundbeck’s second-quarter sales reached DKK 4.48 billion up 13.8% year over year. A group of “strategic brands” which includes Vyepti antidepressant Brintellix and antipsychotics Rexulti and Abilify together contributed 66% of the revenue."

Accenture told an estimated 60 contract employees for Facebook working out of its Austin office that they would soon take away their work Insider has learned.

These contractors work with Facebook through Accenture which has a $500 million-a-year deal with the company to provide hourly workers for services like content moderation and business-integrity services. They learned they were being ""moved off"" of their Facebook work in a Tuesday video meeting that Accenture representatives held a person with knowledge of the call told Insider. Accenture did not immediately offer the affected contractors other jobs or ""direct transfers"" within the company according to worker messages viewed by Insider.

Accenture gave these contractors the option to ""reapply"" for available work at the company if they wished as their current work is set to disappear on Sept. 2. Workers said in the messages they were told the process would include new rounds of interviews and ""no guarantee"" that Accenture would rehire anyone whom the loss of Facebook work affected.

In a follow-up call on Wednesday Accenture representatives told workers that human resources would attempt to place people with certain skills on other projects if they applied for them. Otherwise for those workers that are not rehired or choose not to reapply they will be paid through Oct. 3.

""I want a new job but I don't want to be forced into one"" a worker said in a message discussing the meetings.

Accenture scheduled both calls with little notice and no communication of what they would discuss workers said. Once on the video calls the company hid the names of everyone present including the Accenture representatives speaking. The representatives did not introduce themselves workers said leaving them unclear on who was speaking to them.

""I'm assuming it was HR but no one knows for sure"" the person said. The representatives did not give a specific reason for why Accenture was cutting some employees' work at Facebook. When a worker asked how people were chosen the Accenture representatives said ""an algorithm"" helped choose people at random according to workers.

A representative of Facebook which rebranded to Meta last year declined to comment. Richard Keil a spokesperson for Accenture declined to comment prior to publication beyond a previous statement from the company saying ""It would be inaccurate to report there are layoff actions in Austin."" The term ""layoff"" can have a specific legal definition of employees losing work because of cost-reduction efforts by their employers. After publication Keil insisted that Accenture representatives speaking to workers on the calls were ""introduced"" saying workers may have ""missed that."" As for the purported use of algorithm Keil said ""we don't use algorithms to randomly select people.""

Other Facebook contractors lost work last month

The reduction in Facebook contractors comes as the company indeed looks to rein in costs amid slowing growth and revenue. Facebook imposed a hiring freeze Insider first reported in May. Full-time Facebook employees fear cuts as high as 10% of the company may be coming Insider previously reported. Several executives at the company including Mark Zuckerberg Meta's CEO have recently commented and sent memos to staff promoting a new company culture of ""increased intensity"" stricter performance evaluations and the benefits of fewer resources.

Other Facebook contractors lost work last month Insider previously reported. A former worker said there was a ""messy"" lead up to their loss of work again without severance. The work culture inside Facebook's Austin office began to change over the past several months after the hiring freeze the former worker said. Accenture started to track contractor ""productivity"" more intensely and monitored and logged their employees' already-limited breaks the former worker said while taking away perks covered by Facebook.

The company further scrutinized anyone who did not properly log time away from their desks or those who started work even a few minutes late the former worker added. Accenture put these workers on what's known as a ""performance-development plan."" Across the industry this is commonly known as a ""performance-improvement plan"" and employees widely see it as a precursor to their company letting them go. Employees that Accenture put on a performance-development plan lost their work first the former worker said.

The cuts affect about 60 employees of Accenture a firm that oversees teams of Facebook moderators and other contractors.

The reasons for the cuts are unclear as workers were not given an explanation for the changes. According to Insider workers were informed of the news during a hastily scheduled video call during which nameless Accenture representatives told the contractors they had been selected “at random” via an algorithm.

Facebook declined to comment to Insider and an Accenture rep denied that “layoff actions” had taken place. Affected workers were reportedly told they could reapply and interview for new roles within the firm.

The cuts come as Meta faces unprecedented challenges to its business amid an economic downturn and hits to its advertising business. The company which recently reported shrinking revenue for the first time in its history after losing billions of dollars on its virtual reality division has already drastically cut hiring plans and told managers to weed out low performers . The company also cut back some of its famously extravagant employee perks like onsite laundry service earlier this year. Meta employees are reportedly concerned that the company could slash its workforce by as much as 10 percent though the company has so far denied it has plans for mass layoffs.

But what if you could do more than just play video games on the Steam Deck? What if it could run Lightroom or Photoshop? Would it be possible to edit photos on it?

The thing that you should understand about this device is that while there are many other portable consoles out there the Steam Deck is effectively a complete portable gaming computer packed in a Nintento Switch-like chassis. The system comes pre-loaded with a Linux desktop backend that runs Steam for the actual gaming. But thanks to the availability of a desktop mode you can actually download and run pretty much any combination of Linux applications natively including applications like GIMP and Darktable.

Naturally Linux-based editing apps were the first thing I attempted. Thankfully these applications are free but do come with a rather steep learning curve (especially if you’ve never worked with Linux before).

The Steam Deck technically comes with everything you would need to run it as a computer including a virtual keyboard that pops up and leverages the device’s touch screen along with two touch-sensitive trackpads located on both sides of the screen. These two trackpads effectively act akin to how a full-size trackpad does on a laptop.

Leveraging these built-in tools and the Linux-based apps I was able to load up a recent headshot session through the Steam Deck’s memory card reader and start editing the images using Darktable GIMP and RawTherapee. I actually messed around with a few other apps as well — all of which had a rather tough learning curve — but despite that I was able to cull a session do some basic edits in Darktable and then use RawTherapee and GIMP to actually perform rather basic Photoshop-style edits including some cropping dodging and burning healing cloning and color adjustments.

To say it was cumbersome to use the built-in tools like the included trackpad would be an understatement. That said ease of use wasn’t really what we were interested in testing. The bottom line is if push came to shove you absolutely could edit images using the Linux-based tools and even (with WiFi connected) upload those images to an online gallery or attach them to an email.

On the plus side the Steam Deck supports Bluetooth so I was able to connect my Logitech or Apple wireless keyboards and mice to the Deck which gave me even more freedom to work on the tiny device.

As good as this worked I felt like we could go even further.

For the next step I went ahead and ordered a USB Hub/Dock station for the Steam Deck which allowed me to plug in multiple wired devices like a physical keyboard mouse external hard drives a memory card reader and even connect a monitor using the HDMI port.

Through this process I found that the Steam Deck can output 4K resolution albeit at a maximum of 30hz. Still this allowed me to work in mirrored mode or even extend the desktop in a dual monitor setup that used both the Steam Deck screen and my monitor making the task of retouching a lot easier.

Once I managed this the next thought was if I could get Photoshop running on the Steam Deck. While there actually is a port of Photoshop CC available for Linux devices after an entire day of trying it was just way too over my head. So the next logical step was to just go ahead and dual boot the device with Windows 11 and see if that method would let me install Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.

Installing Windows and Adobe Photoshop on a Steam Deck

I won’t get into the details of how to do it as there are dozens of video guides and instruction pages on how to set up Windows on the Steam Deck (including official drivers for Windows from Valve directly).

Despite these resources it still took me three days to get it running correctly. Granted I was going about it in a particularly tricky way by using a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) to create an ISO that I loaded onto an external SSD so that I could dual boot the device and have Windows installed and operating entirely through the SSD and not on the Steam Deck (as I didn’t want to break anything permanently).

This process definitely added some levels of difficulty but thankfully with the help of Donte Maxwell I finally got it to run.

The results vastly exceeded expectations.

Thanks to the Docking Station I was able to connect the SSD that housed Windows a keyboard mouse and every other peripheral I needed to start the next step of installing Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom Classic. The process once Windows was operating correctly was pretty smooth.

Despite running Windows from an external hard drive there wasn’t any noticeable lag in the system and Photoshop and Lightroom installed surprisingly fast. I even was able to install a few plugins for Photoshop including the Retouch4Me suite and the RetouchingToolkit panels.

But would Lightroom run?

To my surprise Lightroom worked flawlessly and easily imported 20GB worth of RAW files that I had shot on a Nikon Z6 II. Using Lightroom I was able to quickly cull and base edit all the files I wanted to work on with the device for this test. Since I wanted to do some proper dodging and burning and since I was running Windows I wondered if I could connect the latest Wacom Intuos Pro tablet to the device.

While I couldn’t get the Bluetooth to work (it is possible I just didn’t want to spend more time on it) connecting the tablet via the USB cable allowed it to install and work absolutely perfectly including enabling it as a touch surface for even more control options.

The next step was to send these files into Photoshop for final polishing which is the next editing step I would take on any other workstation. It was at this stage that things got a little bit wonky.

While Photoshop installed fine the Steam Deck video card (and drivers) did not have any OpenCL capabilities or support and immediately threw some errors at me once I opened up Photoshop.

Thinking the worst I closed the error message and figured I’d still see if it could work and well other than trying to run plugins that actually leverage the OpenCL drivers everything actually worked extremely smoothly.

Not only was I able to heal clone dodge and burn perform frequency separation use the Retouching Toolkit and a host of other actions I was even able to do all of it using a Wacom Tablet which made the entire process feel like working on any other computer.

Yes You Actually Can Edit Photos On A Steam Deck

So can you edit photos on a Steam Deck? The answer is yes.

Even if I were to disconnect from the keyboard mouse and keyboard I could feasibly still work with Photoshop and Lightroom using just the onboard tools built into the Steam Deck.

But should you edit photos on a Steam Deck? Probably not.

As much fun as I had I don’t really recommend it especially if you’re not planning to use peripherals. The trackpad on the Deck just is not up to the task as far as accuracy and sensitivity are concerned when it comes to photo editing.

All this said though if you happened to be on the road with your files and you didn’t have your laptop and desperately needed to edit photos for some reason you could. We proved that the Steam Deck is actually a capable editing device held back mostly by the hardware that was only ever meant for gaming. Plug in a few peripherals though and it’s just like editing on any other computer.

Over the course of an entire week of logistical technical and actual headaches I have to admit that getting this to work and producing the image above gave me a massive sense of accomplishment.

The system wasn’t made for this and we had no idea if this was even going to work. The fact that it did as it did went far beyond our expectations. I’m positive it would have been easier had I just ran the Windows installation locally on the Steam Deck as well. But despite my issues I guarantee you as time goes on and more people are tinkering with the device better drivers and support will be available to make retouching on the portable game console even more viable.

For those interested orders for the SteamDeck are still available with prices ranging from $399 to $649 depending on the size of the internal SSD you choose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYWRvYmUtbGlnaHRyb29tLXZzLXBob3Rvc2hvcC1leHByZXNzLW1vYmlsZS1waG90by1lZGl0aW5nLWFwcC1jb21wYXJlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Lightroom vs. Photoshop Express: How Do These Mobile Photo Editing Apps Compare?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYWRvYmUtbGlnaHRyb29tLXZzLXBob3Rvc2hvcC1leHByZXNzLW1vYmlsZS1waG90by1lZGl0aW5nLWFwcC1jb21wYXJlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B981AA70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYWRvYmUtbGlnaHRyb29tLXZzLXBob3Rvc2hvcC1leHByZXNzLW1vYmlsZS1waG90by1lZGl0aW5nLWFwcC1jb21wYXJlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy92ZWN0ZWV6eS12cy1pbmtzY2FwZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vecteezy Vs Inkscape: which is the best free Adobe Illustrator vector alternative?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.techradar.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/vecteezy-vs-inkscape (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B981B4C0>, 'Connection to www.techradar.com timed out.

Washington’s efforts to dampen China’s semiconductor ambitions which gathered speed last week after US President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act into law  have become one of the most discussed topics at the 2022 World Semiconductor Conference and Expo which kicked off on Thursday in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing.

China faces immense difficulties in developing its domestic semiconductor industry as the US significantly ramps up export restrictions on advanced technologies according to top Chinese chip experts and executives.

“It is impossible for China to tackle bottlenecks in semiconductor equipment and materials on its own” Yu said during a panel discussion. He suggested that the country should consider alternative paths such as shoring up its strength in advanced packaging including chiplets.

The CSIA which represents 744 member-firms in China’s semiconductor sector on Wednesday denounced the US chips act as a violation of fair trade  and warned of “chaos” in global supply chains.

China’s home-grown chip materials and equipment are not yet good enough to replace imports Hu Wenlong – vice-president of Tongfu Microelectronics a leading Chinese semiconductor testing and packaging company – said at the event.

“Our observation is that the investment in domestic equipment and materials is still insufficient and home-grown production equipment is rarely used in production lines” Hu said. Closer domestic and international cooperation is needed to enhance China’s ability in these areas he added.

Tongfu which was set up in 1997 as a joint venture between the Chinese government and Japan’s Fujitsu has become a key player in the chip industry after it acquired two factories from US semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices in 2016.

While China’s domestic chip industry appears to be doing well when measured by sales data its core technologies leave much to be desired Hu said.

China is the world’s largest semiconductor market thanks to thriving demand from downstream industries ranging from car production to home appliances manufacturing.

Being unable to make more advanced chips such as those used in the latest smartphones China currently spends more on importing ICs than buying foreign oil.

Last month China’s production of ICs dropped 16.6 per cent year on year to 27.2 billion units according to government data as intermittent Covid-19 cases hampered production and hurt demand leading to an oversupply of low-end chip products.

This week’s semiconductor conference in Nanjing is one of the most important annual gatherings for the Chinese chip industry that brings together key players including government officials company executives and top engineers to exchange views on the sector.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. the world’s leading contract chip maker and which runs a 12-inch foundry in Nanjing that makes 16-nanometre and 28-nm chips hosted a special session at the event.

He is now vice president of plant operations and will help decommission the facility.

AES Corp. and Gov. David Ige held a retirement ceremony Thursday for the coal power plant pictured above and its 41 employees at Campbell Industrial Park in Kapolei.

About 40 power plant workers who help keep the lights on across Oahu received thanks from local government leaders and their company Thursday two weeks before the facility’s long-planned shutdown.

Gov. David Ige several state lawmakers and city representatives participated in a retirement ceremony outside the AES Corp. coal-fired plant which has been Oahu’s largest single generator of electricity for 30 years.

The 180-megawatt plant at Campbell Industrial Park in Kapolei is slated to cease operations and electricity sales to utility company Hawaiian Electric on Sept. 1 as part of an effort to achieve a state goal to produce 100% of Hawaii’s energy from renewable sources by 2045.

“AES has been such a vital partner to Hawaii for so many years” Ige said. “Thank you to the employees of AES Hawaii for 30 years of outstanding service.”

Thursday’s ceremony included music food proclamation presentations and a video in which many employees explained their roles at the plant with pride. The event was held in a landscaped area fronting the sprawling complex emitting a fanlike drone and mild industrial smell as 1800 to 2000 tons of coal gets burned daily to power a giant steam-driven turbine that generates electricity.

Pat Murphy who was a newly hired maintenance technician in 1991 when the plant was under construction and helped commission operations in 1992 will soon help decommission the facility where he is now vice president of plant operations.

“I’ve come emotionally to accept what’s going on” he said. “I’ve come to that realization that we’re done. I’ve been able to be involved in a great commercial run.”

Bernerd Da Santos chief operating officer of Virginia-based AES praised workers for their dedication and commitment to safety. “You have done an amazing job” he said.

Of the facility’s 41 employees about six will do decommissioning work and a dozen are to dismantle the plant over three years. Another dozen are retiring or have found new jobs outside AES while about eight have secured jobs at other AES facilities in Hawaii or on the mainland.

Several state lawmakers led by Sen. Maile Shimabu­kuro (D Kalaeloa-Waianae- Makaha) presented AES representatives with a certificate recognizing the plant for its operations and saving ratepayers $2 billion to $4 billion over three decades compared with the cost of power produced from oil.

City Managing Director Mike Formby presented AES representatives with a proclamation from Mayor Rick Blangiardi that included a similar recognition of cost savings.

Per kilowatt-hour electricity from the AES plant costs 6 cents compared with about 30 cents for power from oil. The AES plant had supplied around 16% of Oahu’s electricity in recent decades though more recently it had been 10%.

Though a growing amount of power on Oahu is from solar farms where costs range from 9 to 13 cents per kilowatt-hour Hawaiian Electric initially will have to burn more oil to offset the loss of production from the coal plant and therefore recently estimated that a typical residential customer using 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month will see their bill rise by $15 or 7%.

The coal-powered plant is Oahu’s cheapest source of electricity but also is one of the state’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases putting the equivalent of 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually.

Ige in his remarks at the ceremony alluded to mixed public views about the plant’s existence and impending closure the latter of which is cheered by environmental organizations but will result in job losses and higher electricity bills.

“Our state’s energy needs and concerns were very different (30 years ago) than they are today” Ige said.

When AES was building the $383 million plant in 1991 to address growing electricity needs on Oahu it announced an effort to offset plant greenhouse gas emissions by contributing up to $2 million to help The Nature Conservancy buy 143000 acres of forest in Paraguay to save the land from being cleared for logging and farming.

Now AES is among energy firms shifting away from producing electricity from fossil fuels in favor of generation using renewable sources.

In Hawaii the company operates solar farms on Kauai Maui and Oahu totaling about 35 megawatts as well as a 24-megawatt wind farm in Kahuku. AES also has six solar farm projects in design or construction on Kauai Maui Oahu and Hawaii island to produce about 110 megawatts of electricity plus battery storage. The six solar farms are projected to start running in 2023 and 2024.

“Our team looks forward to continue to serve the people of Hawaii over the next 30 years and beyond with smarter and greener sources of energy” Da Santos said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDgvMTgvcmVkZXZlbG9wbWVudC1wbGFubmVkLWZvci00OS1hY3JlLXBvd2VyLXBsYW50LWluLXJlZG9uZG8tYmVhY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2200 homes Hotel Planned for Power Plant in Redondo Beach,"UPDATED: 11:45 A.M. AUG. 19

A 49-acre power plant in Redondo Beach could turn into a mixed-use waterfront development of offices a hotel and more than 2200 homes if a local developer gets his way.

Next Century Power a firm owned by developer Leo Pustilnikov has filed plans to redevelop the AES power plant at 1100 North Harbor Drive the Torrance Daily Breeze reported. Nearby property owned by the company would expand the project to 51 acres.

Pustilnikov a partner in SLH Investments of Los Angeles bought the 74-year-old natural gas plant from AES Corp. in 2018 for undisclosed terms. The plant is slated to close this year ending power generation at the site since 1907.

Plans call for demolishing the plant and replacing it with One Redondo – a sprawling development including more than 2 million square feet of housing 510000 square feet of offices and a 150000-square-foot hotel surrounding a 22.5-acre park.

Five residential buildings would include 2290 housing units according to a project map of which 458 units would be set aside as affordable for low-income households.

In addition to unspecified space for shops and restaurants Redondo One would include a 300-room hotel at the southeast corner.

Plans also call for converting an existing boiler into an 80000 square-foot office and leaving one of the eight smoke stacks as a tribute to the property’s past.

The plant’s powerhouse along Harbor Drive would also remain as a giant 67000-square-foot event space.

Five garages would include nearly 2 million square feet of parking.

Pustilnikov hopes to fast-track the project through SB 330 a state bill that aims to spur housing development.

Also he has applied to fast-track another mixed-use development at 1021 North Harbor Drive the site of the old SeaLab. That project calls for 30 apartments including six set aside as affordable for low-income households and 7000 square feet of commercial space.

He may get major pushback from the city of Redondo Beach and residents who had hoped to see the power plant site – now zoned for a power plant or park uses – turned into a public park.

Redondo Mayor Bill Brand — who for 17 years has sought to convert the AES plant into a park – once helped kill plans to revitalize the Redondo Beach waterfront.

An LLC with ties to Michigan Avenue Real Estate Group’s leaders bought a vacant parcel for $5.5 million at the southeast corner of West Warren Boulevard and North Paulina Street a person with knowledge of the deal said.

The buyer also has ties to Reinsdorf’s longtime right-hand man — Howard Pizer. The duo’s connection dates all the way back to when Reinsdorf formed Balcor Co. in 1973 which he later sold to American Express in 1987.

The property is within two blocks of the Bulls’ and Blackhawks’ home the United Center. The lot was sold by a group of developers with Irish roots who bought it back in February for $3.5 million. The initial plan was to build a handful of homes that would have been expensive for the neighborhood but not unreasonable for the Chicagoans who are being priced out of the nearby West Loop where property values are swelling due to a wave of new apartment developments.

The former owners were asking for around $250 per square foot on the half-acre site. It proved to be a tough sell at first with a rate that was much higher than other development properties in the neighborhood according to 21 Century broker Steven Powers.

The Reinsdorf-backed group clearly saw an opportunity and moved on it. It paid just $3 per square foot less than the owner’s initial asking price for the parcel.

It borders another half-acre vacant parcel for sale along Madison Street. The price on that listing has not been disclosed. It is being marketed by Oxford Real Estate’s George Manos who did not return a request for comment.

“The sellers found a great development opportunity and were met with a much more intriguing flip opportunity” Powers said. “It just goes to show the development that’s coming to the Near West Side.”

It’s unclear what the buyer plans to do with the property or how much it could spend on an assemblage. Tom Meador also a longtime Reinsdorf partner who led Michigan Avenue did not return a request for comment.

What is clear to Powers however is that whatever is developed on the property will be at a larger scale than the few homes his client intended to build there. That’s the only way the selling price makes economic sense the broker suggested.

Just to the east on the same block Michigan Avenue developed the 52-unit Warren and Ashland apartments which was completed in 2015 according to Yardi Matrix. In 2020 it expanded even farther west into Chicago’s bordering suburb of Oak Park. In that village’s downtown at 435 to 451 Madison Street the firm’s project was scaled back at the request of neighbors and officials before gaining a required zoning variance to build 42 apartments cut from the 48 it first sought for the site.",,,

PFAS or per and polyfluoroalkyl substances are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and man-made processes that attempt to destroy them are expensive energy intensive and have yielded questionable results.

Because PFAS don’t degrade they steadily cycle through and accumulate in the environment and the toxic chemicals are now thought to be contaminating drinking water supplies for over 200 million Americans. They’ve been detected in the Arctic found in rain throughout the globe and are estimated to be in 98% of Americans’ blood. New research has also found them in alarming levels in some food and the air.

Though technology to remove the PFAS from the environment exists researchers until now have not yet figured out how to totally decompose the chemicals after removal.

The effectiveness of an emerging low temperature technique to break down PFAS is outlined in findings published on Thursday in Science. “The fundamental knowledge of how [PFAS] degrade is the single most important thing coming out of this study” said Will Dichtel a Northwestern University researcher and co-author of the new study.

The chemicals are often disposed of in methods that public health advocates have raised concerns about like deep well injection or landfilling. They are also frequently incinerated which evidence suggests only breaks apart the compounds sending still dangerous pieces of PFAS into the air.

“There is no way to dispose of PFAS that is benign so there is a need for a method to get rid of PFAS in a way that does not still pollute” said Brittany Trang a Northwestern researcher and one of the study’s lead authors.

PFAS are used to make thousands of consumer products across dozens of industries resist water stains and heat. They are widely used because they are so effective but those compounds that have been studied are linked to serious health issues like cancer birth defects liver disease kidney problems decreased immunity and high cholesterol.

About 12000 compounds comprise the PFAS class and the method developed by researchers from Northwestern University of California at Los Angeles and Tianjin University is effective on one subclass perfluorocarboxylic acids. It includes compounds commonly produced by industry or found in the environment including PFOA and PFBA that are highly toxic at low levels and have been used in products like waxes and food packaging.

Every PFAS compound shares a common trait that has so far made them virtually indestructible – they have at least one carbon atom that is fluorinated. The new process “defluorinates” the compounds with a mixture of water and the dipolar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) leaving carbon and inorganic fluoride two relatively harmless substances.

Researchers say they expect their method could be broadened to address PFAS in other subclasses. In contrast to other methods used to attempt to destroy the PFAS this approach requires low levels of energy researchers say.

“This method operates under mild conditions and makes benign products and that makes it immediately promising for further study” Dichtel said.

The findings are preliminary and the method is far from being ready to be scaled up and applied on a commercial level researchers stressed. The chemicals are found in water at very low concentrations though at levels that are toxic so they would first have to be removed from contaminated water using reverse osmosis granular activated carbon or other filtration. Once the chemicals are concentrated in wastewater the new method could be used to treat them.

Dichtel who said he has worked on developing methods to decompose PFAS for about seven years called the findings “meaningful”.

Three key findings stood out:

Tools like wishlists are helpful in planning multi-leg journeys. Amenities like fully-functional kitchens and ample common space to gather in are important for longer stays. A positive long-term trip experience usually involved an attentive Host and as such access to the local community and recommendations.

To close out the program we asked participants a series of questions about their travels and advice for others living on Airbnb. This is what they had to say:

What has been your favorite memory from the Live Anywhere on Airbnb program?

“Rupert’s first steps on the sand in a beautiful beach in Costa Rica.” – James G. from the UK

“Most of our time was spent on a large-scale cross country road trip where we fell in love with a number of US cities. In a few cities we had the chance to share our stories with the local media and in Tulsa we even got a mayoral proclamation where April 22 was declared Lindsey and Anna Day!” – Lindsey and Anna from Maryland

What is one travel tip you would share with someone looking to live long term on Airbnb?

“Be flexible. Plans will change all the time make the best of every situation and don’t get stuck on a plan if it’s not meant to be. Stay open-minded and seize opportunities when they arise. Don’t book things too much in advance either.” – Will from France

“Use wishlists! We used the wishlist feature as a parking lot for potential Airbnbs. Sometimes we’d get up to 15 20 25 different homes and then would narrow it down to our top four or five listings.” – Ben & Peta from France and South Africa

“Prioritize the Airbnb over everything else (including location). Unlike a holiday you will spend a lot of time at home which is what makes an Airbnb vs. hotel so helpful. When living like a nomad it’s essential to have a comfortable home to return to at the end of the day of travel or working remotely.” – Steven from France

“If you’re traveling with a group opt for spaces where every person has their own room regardless of how comfortable you are with each other. Yet it’s also important to find a place where there are spaces for interaction like big living rooms or balconies. Even just a small cozy corner where people can gather and exchange stories or simply do work together.” – Hendric from Singapore

What advice do you have for Airbnb Hosts who want to make their listings more hospitable for long-term stays?

“When booking a weekend or a shorter trip we were happy to get a door code make ourselves at home and not interact with the Host at all and just get on with our holiday. But when staying in places longer we definitely craved more communication from Hosts and it made all the difference in helping us feel at home.” – Stephanie from Tennessee

“I really appreciated Hosts that outfitted their Airbnbs for longer stays. Listings that actually had full kitchen equipment ones that even provide things like detergent. It is really nice when you walk into an Airbnb and there’s those little extras that you need for long-term stays that you don’t necessarily have with you.” – Victoria from Russia

“Show your guests around! One of my Hosts took me to her favorite places cafes and restaurants. Those places became my favorite places. At one of the cafes that I frequented the owner would come out on occasion and greet me and say hello. That meant the world to me because it made me feel like a local and was extremely kind. Those are the experiences that I think anyone wants when they travel especially if they’re traveling long-term.” – Marquita from New York

With the recent launch of Airbnb Categories what is your favorite Category on Airbnb?

“We love the flexibility that the new site allows. Because we’ve spent the year traveling we’ve been really flexible not only with time but also with location. We always use the Flexible dates feature to make sure we’re seeing the best listings even if it means changing our plans slightly. Category-wise Amazing Pools are always a hit with Hays! We’ve been lucky enough to have pools at our homes in Thailand Sri Lanka and Vietnam!” – Stephanie from Tennessee

“By far our favorite is the Design Category! Just magnificent properties pop up that weren’t as readily visible before. Next was the Beaches Category because of the uniqueness of these Airbnb listings. And finally the OMG! Category. Love having the option to have the system surface candidates that would not otherwise come our way.” – Ben & Peta from France and South Africa

What have been some of the benefits of living long-term on Airbnb?

“On longer stays personal connections were most important. For us connection means feeling connected to the local community wherever we are. One of the ways that we do this is going back to the same places like a coffee shop a place for breakfast or a grocery to buy produce. We don’t try to see everything and we are really living in our neighborhood. People start to recognize us and we feel connected to the fiber of the local community.” – Ben & Peta from France and South Africa

“I liked Hosts who tailored recommendations for longer stays for instance practical basics like banking post office or where to buy household supplies in the neighborhood – local perspectives you would only get by staying at an Airbnb.” – Hendric from Singapore

What was something you found challenging about living long-term on Airbnb?

“It’s ‘hard’ to constantly adapt to a new city and a new apartment. And with longer stays of 28 or more days most of the time we had a hard time canceling our stay if countries closed or flights were changed because of the strict cancellation policy.” – Jonathan from Canada

“A common misconception people have about the nomadic lifestyle is that you are going to be on a perpetual holiday which is not the case if you have to work because at first you might be trying to live like a tourist almost full time but sooner or later you have to accept that you need a certain routine and that you have to use your energy for your job. So it’s not all just fun.” – Maria from Argentina

Will you be continuing your nomad travels once the program wraps? If so where will you go next?

“Would love to! Considering the Philippines as there was still so much to explore in the region. Not to mention the vibrant nomadic community as well.” – Hendric from Singapore",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9ob3ctYWlyYm5iLWFpbXMtZGV0ZWN0LWhpZ2gtcmlzay1ib29raW5ncy1oYWx0aW5nLXBhcnRpZXMtMTczNDY1MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Airbnb Aims to Detect 'High-Risk' Bookings in Halting Parties,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9ob3ctYWlyYm5iLWFpbXMtZGV0ZWN0LWhpZ2gtcmlzay1ib29raW5ncy1oYWx0aW5nLXBhcnRpZXMtMTczNDY1MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA99C8B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9ob3ctYWlyYm5iLWFpbXMtZGV0ZWN0LWhpZ2gtcmlzay1ib29raW5ncy1oYWx0aW5nLXBhcnRpZXMtMTczNDY1MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTkvbWlsbGVubmlhbC1jb3VwbGUtZWFybnMtcGFzc2l2ZS1pbmNvbWUtcmVudGluZy1vdXQtaG9tZXMtb24tYWlyYm5iLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8xOS9taWxsZW5uaWFsLWNvdXBsZS1lYXJucy1wYXNzaXZlLWluY29tZS1yZW50aW5nLW91dC1ob21lcy1vbi1haXJibmIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This couple made $13000 in passive income in just over a month: 'We only work 1 hour per week',"Wedding photographers Stephan Alvin and Adriana Krause bought two homes — one in Rio and one outside of Yosemite — to be closer to their families and work. They have made $18000 in nine months renting them out on Airbnb.

Last September wedding photographers Adriana Krause and Stephan Alvin did something unusual. They bought a second home during a global pandemic. The home a cabin in Oakhurst California is their business's headquarters located near Yosemite National Park where they shoot small ceremonies. When they're not in California they're in Rio de Janeiro where they purchased a condo in July 2020. Krause 29 and Alvin 38 split their time between the two cities. When they're in one home they rent out the other on Airbnb. The resultant income in just nine months: $18000. A majority of that income has come from their Oakhurst cabin which cashed in $13000 after listing the property at the end of July according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. ""It took months of work to make both places feel like home"" Krause tells CNBC Make It. ""But now we only work one hour per week."" That hour is spent confirming bookings and coordinating cleaning staff to ensure the properties are ready for the next guests. But the real estate side hustle is a risky and costly venture. Together the couple's homes will cost roughly $487000 between renovations and both mortgages according to Krause.

While the revenue from Airbnb bookings hasn't yet covered the homes' price tags Krause says the couple — who made $215000 from their photography business last year — is on track to cover their bills and then some. Profits pending they have a grand plan: Once their second home is paid off they intend to put that passive income toward travel. ""It's both a safe and crazy way to start a business because nobody really wants to rent out where they live"" Krause says. ""But we're both willing to take calculated risks and the rewards have been pretty huge.""

A three-bedroom condo in Rio

Krause and Alvin met while working as skaters for Disney on Ice. In 2018 they retired from showbiz got married and moved into an apartment in Fresno California near Alvin's family. Within a year they started their wedding photography company.

Living in Fresno while working hours away in Yosemite and Sequoia National Park wasn't exactly convenient and Krause says the city ""never quite felt like home."" ""Business was going great in 2019 and we had put all this work in to make 2020 great"" she says. ""But when the pandemic happened we found ourselves wondering 'Why are we living here?'"" The couple pooled their savings to buy the Rio condo formerly owned by a friend for the equivalent of roughly $127000 Krause says. Because of wildfires and snow they don't book wedding shoots during summer and winter months — so they bought the three-bedroom condo as a place to spend those six months a short walk from the beach and near Krause's family.

While in Brazil they use their time to edit photos update their website and vacation. The money they earn during their photography season is enough to sustain them through their offseason Krause says. Since listing the condo on Airbnb in November 2021 Krause and Alvin have earned $5600 from six visits — an average of one visit per month before the couple returned to live there again.

A one-bedroom cabin outside of Yosemite

The couple kept their apartment in Fresno as a temporary U.S. base while searching for a replacement closer to their work. They wanted to keep renting Krause says — but the one-bedroom red cabin's charm lured them in and convinced them to buy it as a second home. The cabin cost roughly $325000 plus another $35000 over six months to renovate it repair water damages and decorate it Krause says. Even once it was livable she adds she spent weeks adding personal touches and taking virtual classes to learn how to make both properties profitable on Airbnb.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC1uZXdzL2FpcmJuYi1icmluZ3MtaW4tYW50aS1wYXJ0eS10ZWNobm9sb2d50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb Continues to Crack Down on Parties with New Booking Technology — What to Know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.travelandleisure.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /travel-news/airbnb-brings-in-anti-party-technology (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA99E0B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC1uZXdzL2FpcmJuYi1icmluZ3MtaW4tYW50aS1wYXJ0eS10ZWNobm9sb2d50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuY2UuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYm5iLXNsYXZlLWNhYmluLWZlYXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Airbnb Property Was Listed As A ‘Slave Cabin.’ It Never Housed Enslaved People,"Popular vacation rental company Airbnb is under fire after a TikTok video slamming a Mississippi property described as a “slave cabin” went viral.

The estate at the center of the controversy is the Panther Burn Cottage a small cottage in Greenville Mississippi. The description stated the building once served as a slave quarters. The posting also claimed it was used as a sharecropper cabin and later a medical office.

Wynton Yates a civil rights attorney posted the video on July 28. Screenshots of the property showed 68 reviews and an overall 4.97 rating. He highlighted how people who had stayed at the property used words like “historic” “elegant” “delightful” and “cool” to describe it.

Article continues after video.

Many social media users were appalled that the location could be rented as a bed and breakfast. The accommodation has since been taken down from Airbnb’s website and an apology has been issued.

But the location was never a slave cabin.

Yates shares with ESSENCE that the property’s new owner a man named Brad Hauser contacted him at the start of August. He says Hauser revealed to him that the small wooden cottage was never actually a slave cabin and not part of any plantation.

Hauser also strongly opposed the decision of the previous owner to market the property as a place that once housed formerly enslaved people.

According to Yates Hauser also explained the building’s original owner said it was used as a doctor’s office and was not old enough to have housed slaves.

“How is this ok?” Yates asks. “Someone intentionally marketed a vacation rental as a former slave cabin because they felt slavery was a good selling point.”

Brad Hauser did not respond to ESSENCE’s request for comment.

“To use slavery as a selling point is not only gross and dismissive of a horrible history in this this country” Yates says. “It’s also the continued profiting from slavery.”

The controversy raises a larger conversation on the commodification of Black trauma and its role in the U.S. travel and tourism industry.

***

Tourism Reset is a research initiative working to challenge inequality in tourism. The project’s co-directors Dr. Alana Dillette and Dr. Stephanie Benjamin say slavery being used as a marketing tactic is indicative of the industry.

“The fact that someone realized that that they could use [slavery] and people would want to come also says more about where we are in this space in 2022 that it is something that actually attracts somebody to a place” Dr. Dillette tells ESSENCE.

“Unfortunately this isn’t really anything new” Dr. Benjamin who is white says. “There’s long been a romanticization of this time in the American past.”

Plantations have become a popular location for couples to be married at. Yet these sprawling estates with mansions cannot be separated from their history of violence and brutality. They are relics of slavery not the backdrop for a party.

The Boone Plantation in South Carolina was where celebrity couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds were married in 2012. The couple faced major criticism after details of their wedding resurfaced online in 2018. Reynolds would later tell Fast Company that they learned from their mistake issued a public apology and donated over one million dollars each to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

That wasn’t the last time plantations were used as a prop for celebration. In fact another infamous instance saw one person actually wanting to bring people in to recreate the feel of slavery.

In 2013 celebrity chef Paula Deen was lambasted after admitting she wanted to enlist Black men to portray slaves at a wedding she was planning. She said she got the idea from a restaurant she and her husband dined at in the South.

“The whole entire waiter staff was middle-aged black men and they had on beautiful white jackets with a black bow tie” said Deen during a videotaped deposition. “I mean it was really impressive. That restaurant represented a certain era in America …after the Civil War during the Civil War before the Civil War … It was not only Black men but it was also Black women … I would say they were slaves” she said.

In 2019 Color of Change a civil rights advocacy group lobbied The Knot Worldwide Zola Pinterest and other wedding planning websites to stop promoting and romanticizing plantations as wedding venues.

“Marketing plantations as ‘classic’ or ‘timeless’ places to celebrate a big day communicates a clear message to your Black clients and readers: that their suffering is something to be celebrated if not completely erased. Plantations are former forced labor camps that brutalized and murdered millions of Black people in this country— they are not party spaces ” read the petition on organization’s website.

As a result Pinterest and The Knot Worldwide and other companies ceased the promotion of wedding venues and content that glamourized former plantations. The organizations behind the change also worked on new guidelines to ensure that wedding vendors do not use language on their websites that washes over Southern plantation history.

***

Dr. Dillette and Dr. Benjamin believe organizations in the tourism industry like Airbnb need a thorough research process. The insight will prevent users from being able to capitalize on Black Americans’ trauma.

“We have to…amplify these stories and when this stuff happens like in this case call people out. But more importantly like with Airbnb they took the listing down. Good. That’s step one” Dr. Dillette says.

Yates believes the discourse that came from this incident was necessary. “It’s not just going out on a crusade to take down these posts” said Yates. “It’s about having the conversations of not allowing the history and experience of slavery to be to continue to be whitewashed in this country” Yates says."

Many in the industry are in full celebration mode.

“It’s a big deal” said Jonathan Evans president and CEO of Lithium Americas Corp. “We’re delighted with it.” His company which is working to build the largest lithium mine in the United States is considering building a second U.S. mine he said citing optimism over the demand for domestic minerals.

Mining companies are expected to see more widespread demand from the auto and battery manufacturing sectors under the law because of mineral sourcing requirements that must be met to qualify for the new expanded EV tax credit. This language was added to the bill at the request of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). EV backers have groused at the provision which will limit the tax credit for those purchasing such vehicles (E&E Daily Aug. 8).

But for those in the mining sector the new law is a bonanza.

“For [mining companies] it’s essentially creating a new industry in the U.S.” said Marc Coltelli e-mobility and energy leader for Ernst & Young a consulting firm.

Democrats told E&E News they included the mining tax break language as a way to combat China a global leader in mineral supply chains central to making energy and transportation goods that produce fewer carbon emissions (E&E Daily Aug. 15).

The climate law is the latest in a string of wins for minerals players who for years have warned the U.S. was ceding ground to China. Both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the recently enacted bill aiding the semiconductor industry are expected to juice local demand for minerals. The Biden administration has also taken action to boost the industry.

According to some industry projections a host of minerals are expected to see soaring demand amid the transition away from fossil fuels. For EVs and batteries those minerals include lithium cobalt nickel and graphite. Hydrogen fuel cells and solar panels also require their own sets of minerals like palladium or tellurium.

Earlier this year Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to boost the development of those “critical minerals” which are a class of heavily imported hardrock commodities determined by the federal government to be essential for national and economic security (Greenwire April 4).

In addition the Energy Department has continued a Trump-era decision to use “clean energy” loan programs for battery technology innovation as a way to assist the mining and metals sector. Officials last month announced they closed on the first-ever loan to a mineral processing facility located in Louisiana (Greenwire May 11).

These laws and regulatory decisions “play a really strong role” in giving “confidence” to investors mining and manufacturing companies and consumers around supply and demand expectations related to the mineral supply chain Coltelli said.

‘Reason to be more jubilant’

Evans the CEO of Lithium Americas is developing what is expected to be the biggest lithium mine in the U.S. at Thacker Pass in Nevada. He said his company is so optimistic about U.S. demand for minerals and the federal government’s view of the mining sector that it is now considering a second mine in the U.S. before Thacker Pass has even been constructed.

“We’re committed to growing domestically” he said.

He credited the climate law for some of this optimism calling it “a significant step in the right direction toward fighting climate change and securing our country’s future by onshoring the manufacturing essential to reduce carbon emissions.”

Barbara Little a spokesperson for U.S. lithium chemicals producer Albemarle Corp. told E&E News in a statement the company sees the climate law “as a positive step forward in support of attracting EV supply chain investment domestically to support the transition to clean energy in the U.S.”

Another delighted firm is Talon Metals Corp. a junior exploration company. Talon Metals is developing a nickel project in northern Minnesota with global mining conglomerate Rio Tinto. That project got a shoutout from the White House in a press release earlier this year.

After the climate legislation passed the Senate earlier this month the company announced it secured exploration rights on 400000 acres of land in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in order to look for more nickel — and named Manchin in their press release about the deal.

Todd Malan chief external affairs officer for Talon Metals said in an interview that the requirements in the EV tax credit are providing “important encouragement” to the auto sector and the Biden administration “to focus on the early part of the supply chain” for EVs.

“That to me is a directional impetus” Malan said.

Malan also said the tax break for mining companies could prove useful because developing a mine can require an incredible amount of upfront capital spending up.

“The [spending] upfront when you basically take into account the cost of exploration the cost of permitting the cost of building a facility … the upfront [spending] is huge and can take a long time to earn out of” he said. “This really moves the needle in terms of bankability of projects and economic viability.”

The law is also exciting mineral processing companies which play a crucial role in the midstream of the mineral supply chain.

John DeMaio CEO of graphite processing company Graphex Group Ltd. said there is “reason to be more jubilant” about the climate law because “it definitely indicates positive movement” and “real on-the-ground dollars and cents toward electrification.” Graphex recently announced it would be building its first facility in Warren Mich. near the heart of Motor City.

“I think the bill does force or motivates the industry to create the midstream processing” DeMaio said. “The beauty of the midstream capability [is] that can be located really anywhere.”

EY’s Coltelli said all of the action in the mineral supply chain will prove beneficial for the U.S. marketplace for EVs by fostering “collaboration across the ecosystem” with “every industry working together to make this a success.”

“This is hugely exciting for the industry and will certainly start to center value creation in EV adoption here” he said.

The permitting question

There are certainly some losers in the mining industry. Coal companies for instance have run into roadblocks from regulators. Last week the Interior Department reimposed a ban on federal coal leasing.

Permitting is another concern for the mining sector. Over the last decade the number of new applications to build a mine on federal lands has declined almost every year according to data obtained by E&E News. Some in the industry have cited economic uncertainty as a reason for the decline (Greenwire Aug. 9).

This fall observers will be watching to see if Congress can pass changes to the federal permitting regime requested by Manchin who made a deal on permits a precondition for his vote on the climate bill (Energywire Aug. 4).

Progressives have been deeply skeptical of the permitting overhaul effort (E&E Daily Aug. 15). Yesterday Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) wrote an op-ed vowing to “fight against” any permitting overhaul bill calling it a “mishmash of long-desired permitting shortcuts that will further inflate oil company profits at the expense of our environment and communities.”

In an interview with E&E News he said such an effort “effectively contradicts some of the strong things we [achieved] for the climate because it would expedite everything and neutralize [the National Environmental Policy Act].”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3NwZWNpYWx0eS1jaGVtaWNhbHMtbWFya2V0LXRvLXJlY29yZC1hLWNhZ3Itb2YtMy00MS0tYWdyb2NoZW1pY2Fscy10by1iZS1sYXJnZXN0LXJldmVudWUtZ2VuZXJhdGluZy1lbmQtdXNlci1zZWdtZW50cy0tLXRlY2huYXZpby0zMDE2MDc2MzkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Specialty Chemicals Market to Record a CAGR of 3.41% Agrochemicals to be Largest Revenue-generating End-user ...,"This report offers an up-to-date analysis of the current market scenario the latest trends and drivers and the overall market environment.

The past two years have been an unprecedented time for technology with companies facing and overcoming many challenges—often with approaches previously considered impossible. Agile operating models have been adapted to remote working teams have been quickly equipped to work from home and large programs such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) rollouts were successfully carried out in a virtual and decentralized manner.

At the 18th annual McKinsey Technology IT Conference leading CIOs from across industries discussed how they turned lessons from the pandemic into facilitators for maintaining the momentum of successful tech transformations in the face of rising volatility. Four themes emerged in the discussions.

Vision and purpose

Of course technology executives aim to develop an ambitious and courageous vision for technology and its role in their organization. But beyond aligning teams around a common goal an effective vision helps to establish and build those teams in the first place.

Since attracting the right tech talent is challenging tech leaders at the conference shared how a purpose-driven vision can support this effort. We heard examples from pharmaceutical companies that appeal to tech talent by reinforcing how technology contributes to saving human lives by enabling data-driven approaches to medical research and even individualized medicine. Similarly organizations that harness IT and technology for environmental or social impact can successfully attract candidates by following a “green tech” agenda with a zero-carbon footprint for their data centers.

With technology becoming ever more ubiquitous the participants also demonstrated how being able to articulate this vision and tell their story can create a following. Some examples were inspiring. One technology leader delineated the vision of creating a greenfield technology for a cognitive city. Another described shaping the vision for its products by motivating teams to think beyond immediate customer feedback to genuine innovation.

Reduction of complexity

Against the backdrop of multiple international crises business resiliency is increasingly important. However the ability to react quickly to changing needs is often hampered by overly complex technology landscapes.

Most participants agreed that reducing technology debt consolidating core systems and rationalizing the application portfolio are top priorities that serve multiple purposes:

They enable technology to react faster to changing needs in times of volatility when priorities shift quickly between innovation and responses to demand or supply shocks.

Less complexity translates into lower risk. For example a CIO shared how consolidating the manufacturing execution systems at its various plants was a major factor in reducing the company’s exposure to cyberattacks and a CTO explained how less complex systems would allow the company to minimize impact and “bounce back” more rapidly if an attack were successful.

They decrease mid-to-long-term costs. One CIO shared how reducing complexity after a major carve-out and consolidating the application portfolio cut costs in some instances by up to 35 percent.

Tech-enabled business leadership

Even though the topic of business–IT integration has always been on the minds of technology executives a lot of discussion at the conference centered on how to bring the two sides even closer together to enable organizations to harness the best of technology.

One chief digital officer shared how he reshaped the organization to make it possible for business leaders to lead truly cross-functional efforts that include both product and tech teams. This approach allowed the classical IT function to focus on providing only a few core services. Similarly one CIO recounted how he systematically makes the owner of the most complex part of a process responsible for both the enterprise architecture in that area and the hands-on work to simplify and align it with the business process.

Such responsibilities often require educating business leaders who have no tech background which was also a theme throughout the conference. Another CIO shared how he systematically upskills leaders and employees outside of the technology function to take advantage of technology and data and spur usage throughout the company. A data platform creates a portal that enables data producers and consumers to easily find and use data.

Stamina

The last theme that emerged from the conference was the need for technology leaders to keep moving forward with their technology agenda.

Multiple technology executives discussed how they need to persist in modernizing their underlying core technology estate which is often seen as less innovative than pursuing digital use cases. This choice sometimes requires more perseverance—for example to convince the CFO to dedicate line items for tech transformation in the upcoming years.

And while such transformations are already complex multiyear projects they are successful only if they go beyond predefined goals to build an organization’s “transformation muscle.” The CTO of a bank shared how he embedded continuous improvement and innovation into his organization’s culture after a multiyear tech transformation that successfully reached its targets. This commitment not only was appreciated by the bank’s business leaders but also helped retain tech talent who were energized to continue evolving and innovating.

When discussing how his company invests in basic research in quantum computing a CTO demonstrated how much basic research is still necessary and how it requires stamina to both continue the pursuit of a vision and avoid overhyping a future technology.

Even though none of the four themes is new per se multiple global crises and increasing volatility require tech leaders to sharpen their approach by defining a purpose-driven vision cleaning their tech houses to become more resilient empowering their employees and leaders and persisting in the face of today’s challenges.

The City of Beachwood in partnership with Beachwood Place is one of many cities to adopt this new highly effective technology.

Beachwood now has 31 LPRs stationed throughout the city and two patrol vehicles with mobile units with additional units expected this fall the City of Beachwood shared in a press release on Friday.

LPRs are electronic devices with cameras to catch and record the license plates of the vehicles that pass them. The location date and time of the vehicle passing the device is also recorded.

This information is run through a ""hot list"" for possible matches to then alert authorities.

“This technology will better align our law enforcement work with what’s happening nationwide and it will offer greater protection to our residents and visitors” said City of Beachwood Mayor Justin Berns.

The press release goes on to say that the information recorded from the LPRs can potentially assist in stopping crimes in progress locating missing and/or endangered persons as well as providing investigative leads for crimes that have already occurred.

BEACHWOOD Ohio — Beachwood is taking their surveillance measures to the next level.

Police Chief Kate McLaughlin announced Friday there are now 31 license plate readers installed throughout the city with two mobile units in patrol vehicles.

The city says the license plate readers use high-speed cameras to capture the plates of passing vehicles while recording the location date and time.

“If the information matches that of a vehicle recorded in a ‘hot list’ it will alert law enforcement” according to a press release from Beachwood. “That information can be used to assist to stop crimes in progress locate missing and/or endangered persons as well as provide investigative leads for crimes that have already occurred.”

The city also says it’s technology that “has been widely adopted among law enforcement departments and retail businesses nationwide to help apprehend suspects.”

“This technology will better align our law enforcement work with what’s happening nationwide and it will offer greater protection to our residents and visitors” says Mayor Justin Berns.

Additional license plate readers are on order and expected in the city this fall.

Georgia’s insurance commissioner has accused Allstate of exploiting a loophole in state law to impose a 25% increase in auto insurance rates there the carrier’s second since the start of 2022.

“I am angry and disappointed that Allstate has chosen to exploit a loophole in state law to implement such a substantial increase in costs on hardworking Georgians when families are already struggling with historic inflation everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store” said Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John F. King. “This latest increase means Allstate has now bypassed our office to raise overall rates in Georgia by 40% in this calendar year alone.”

In response King said he has begin conversations with legislators about changing Georgia law to give his office “additional authorities to protect consumers from these types of inexcusable actions.” Steve Manders the state’s deputy commissioner of insurance told Repairer Driven News that “nothing has been drafted as of yet” in that regard.

Georgia law establishes a “dual rate” filing system governing auto insurance rates. The insurance commissioner only has the authority to approve or disapprove minimum policy filings while all other filings can go into effect immediately under what is known as “file and use.” Allstate’s latest increase falls under the latter category the Office of Commissioner of Insurance and Safety Fire said in a statement.

Manders said Allstate’s filing differs from the norm both in its magnatude and in its approach. Usually he said a carrier will submit two filings including one for a minimum policy and the other under “file and use” with both filings being considered at the same time. Allstate submitted only the “file and use” filing avoiding the approval process.

This rate increase will take effect for new Allstate customers on September 12 while current customers will see the increase on their renewals beginning October 16 the office said.

The commissioner’s office is encouraging Georgia policyholders to reach out to Allstate to discuss the reasons for the increase and the options available to them. Allstate can be reached by telephone at 1-800- 255-7828 online at www.allstate.com or on Twitter at @allstate.

Responding to ” ongoing inflationary impacts on claim severities” Allstate has raised auto insurance rates by an average of 8.3% in all 50 states according to the company’s second quarter underwriting results. Yet it’s continuing to lose money on auto insurance.

The carrier said last month that it paid out nearly $1.08 to cover claims and expenses in its auto business for every dollar of premium it collected. Even subtracting the effects of claims payments due to wind and hail storms mainly in the Midwest Allstate paid out $1.02 for every dollar in premium.

Allstate has been carrying out its pledge to investors to aggressively pursue rate increases to bring its auto insurance business back to profitability. The company reported implementing rate increases totaling $258 million in the month and $601 million in the quarter after implementing $862 million and $702 million of rate increases in the first quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021 respectively.

“The impact of rising claim repair costs and upward prior year loss reserve development led to a recorded combined ratio of 107.9 in the second quarter” Allstate CEO Tom Wilson said in an August 3 statement. “The underwriting loss combined with equity valuation declines and losses on fixed income sales resulted in a net loss of $1.04 billion and an adjusted net loss of $209 million in the quarter. As a result we are further accelerating insurance price increases implementing underwriting restrictions in underperforming states and reducing advertising spend which is expected to improve profitability and slow policy growth.”

In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Allstate said it is not done seeking higher rates. “Allstate continues to implement significant insurance rate increases given ongoing inflationary impacts on claim severities” it said.

The carrier reported three factors reflecting “persistent increases” in loss costs:

Increases in physical damage costs are geographically widespread and reflect higher part prices labor rates and length of claim resolution.

Increases in injury claim costs reflect more severe auto accidents increased medical inflation higher consumption of medical treatment and more claims with attorney representation.

Claims reported in 2021 but settled in 2022 were subject to the rising vehicle values parts prices and labor rates experienced during 2022 which contributed to the adverse loss of reserve development.

Loading...

Each day Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that occurred on this date.

What Happened? On this day in 2004 Google held its initial public offering.

Where The Market Was: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10040.82 and the S&P 500 traded at 1091.23.

What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2004 the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. Facebook — now Meta Platforms Inc META — was launched but the platform was only initially open to Harvard students other college students in the Boston area and other Ivy League schools. The average price of a new house was $274500.

Google Goes Public: Google now known as Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL finally held its highly anticipated IPO in 2004 six years after it was founded. The company had already become a search juggernaut by that time and IPO shares were priced at $85 per share for a valuation of $23 billion.

Surprisingly the IPO auction didn’t go particularly well for Google in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. Google ended up cutting its planned IPO price from an original range of between $108 and $135 to a new target range of between $85 and $95 before finally settling on the low end of the reduced range.

On Google’s first day of trading the stock jumped 18%. Google split its stock in a two-to-one split in 2014 and reorganized its company under the Alphabet umbrella in 2015.

It completed a second 20-to-1 stock split in 2022.

IPO investors that have held onto the stock have certainly been rewarded. Over the past 18 years Google's stock has generated an overall return that's more than 10 times higher than the S&P 500.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWJvcnRpb24tZ29vZ2xlLXdvcmtlcnMtZGVtYW5kLXByb3RlY3Rpb25zLWRhdGEtcHJpdmFjeS_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9hYm9ydGlvbi1nb29nbGUtd29ya2Vycy1kZW1hbmQtcHJvdGVjdGlvbnMtZGF0YS1wcml2YWN5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google workers demand abortion protections and stronger data privacy,"Hundreds of Google employees are petitioning the company to extend its abortion health care benefits to contract workers and to strengthen privacy protections for Google users searching for abortion information online.

Google parent company Alphabet had pledged to pay travel and other health care costs for employees seeking an out-of-state abortion and to help some workers relocate after the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the constitutional right to an abortion. The June decision overturning 1973′s Roe v. Wade ruling has paved the way for severe abortion restrictions or bans in nearly half of the U.S. states.

The benefits for abortion services offered by Google and other tech companies don't cover contract workforces which are common in the tech industry and often get paid less and have fewer perks than full-time employees.

A letter signed by more than 650 employees and sent this week to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Alphabet executives calls for the inclusion of contractors in those benefits. The petition was organized by members of the Alphabet Workers Union a labor union that's been trying to gain traction inside the company.

It also demands that the company cease any political donations or lobbying of politicians or organizations ""responsible for appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and continue to infringe on other human rights issues related to voting access and gun control.""

The employees seek additional protection for Google users such as by blocking advertisements that misleadingly direct users to anti-abortion ""pregnancy crisis"" centers.

The employees' petition said the company should also institute immediate data privacy controls for all health-related activity including abortion information so that it ""must never be saved handed over to law enforcement or treated as a crime.""

The recent case of a Nebraska teenager facing felony charges over an alleged abortion — charges that prosecutors were able to bring thanks to messages they obtained from Facebook — has caused alarm in privacy and technology circles.

Privacy advocates fear that as states like Texas and Oklahoma create bounty hunter laws to prod citizens into reporting on suspected abortions data surveillance offers a plethora of possible sources of evidence for prosecutors.

Google declined to comment about the petition Thursday. The company said in July it would start automatically purging information about users who visit abortion clinics or other places that could trigger legal problems.

Loading...

Each day Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that occurred on this date.

What Happened? On this day in 2004 Google held its initial public offering.

Where The Market Was: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10040.82 and the S&P 500 traded at 1091.23.

What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2004 the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. Facebook — now Meta Platforms Inc META — was launched but the platform was only initially open to Harvard students other college students in the Boston area and other Ivy League schools. The average price of a new house was $274500.

Google Goes Public: Google now known as Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL finally held its highly anticipated IPO in 2004 six years after it was founded. The company had already become a search juggernaut by that time and IPO shares were priced at $85 per share for a valuation of $23 billion.

Surprisingly the IPO auction didn’t go particularly well for Google in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. Google ended up cutting its planned IPO price from an original range of between $108 and $135 to a new target range of between $85 and $95 before finally settling on the low end of the reduced range.

On Google’s first day of trading the stock jumped 18%. Google split its stock in a two-to-one split in 2014 and reorganized its company under the Alphabet umbrella in 2015.

It completed a second 20-to-1 stock split in 2022.

IPO investors that have held onto the stock have certainly been rewarded. Over the past 18 years Google's stock has generated an overall return that's more than 10 times higher than the S&P 500.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWJvcnRpb24tZ29vZ2xlLXdvcmtlcnMtZGVtYW5kLXByb3RlY3Rpb25zLWRhdGEtcHJpdmFjeS_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9hYm9ydGlvbi1nb29nbGUtd29ya2Vycy1kZW1hbmQtcHJvdGVjdGlvbnMtZGF0YS1wcml2YWN5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google workers demand abortion protections and stronger data privacy,"Hundreds of Google employees are petitioning the company to extend its abortion health care benefits to contract workers and to strengthen privacy protections for Google users searching for abortion information online.

Google parent company Alphabet had pledged to pay travel and other health care costs for employees seeking an out-of-state abortion and to help some workers relocate after the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the constitutional right to an abortion. The June decision overturning 1973′s Roe v. Wade ruling has paved the way for severe abortion restrictions or bans in nearly half of the U.S. states.

The benefits for abortion services offered by Google and other tech companies don't cover contract workforces which are common in the tech industry and often get paid less and have fewer perks than full-time employees.

A letter signed by more than 650 employees and sent this week to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Alphabet executives calls for the inclusion of contractors in those benefits. The petition was organized by members of the Alphabet Workers Union a labor union that's been trying to gain traction inside the company.

It also demands that the company cease any political donations or lobbying of politicians or organizations ""responsible for appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and continue to infringe on other human rights issues related to voting access and gun control.""

The employees seek additional protection for Google users such as by blocking advertisements that misleadingly direct users to anti-abortion ""pregnancy crisis"" centers.

The employees' petition said the company should also institute immediate data privacy controls for all health-related activity including abortion information so that it ""must never be saved handed over to law enforcement or treated as a crime.""

The recent case of a Nebraska teenager facing felony charges over an alleged abortion — charges that prosecutors were able to bring thanks to messages they obtained from Facebook — has caused alarm in privacy and technology circles.

Privacy advocates fear that as states like Texas and Oklahoma create bounty hunter laws to prod citizens into reporting on suspected abortions data surveillance offers a plethora of possible sources of evidence for prosecutors.

Google declined to comment about the petition Thursday. The company said in July it would start automatically purging information about users who visit abortion clinics or other places that could trigger legal problems. Users have always had the option to edit their location histories on their own but Google said it will proactively do it for them as an added level of protection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTE4L2JpZy10ZWNoLXN0ZXBzLXVwLWdpZnRzLXRvLWxhd21ha2Vycy1tdWxsaW5nLWFudGl0cnVzdC1jcmFja2Rvd27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schumer Stalls Senate Antitrust Bill as Big Tech Money Pours In,"Why did this happen?

Amazon updates return to office guidance

Today we shared this update with our teams globally:

Many of you have been asking for some guidance around returning to the office so you can better plan the next several months (including school plans for those with kids). We wanted to share our thinking and provide an update beyond the June 30 guidance we’ve provided to date.

Our plan is to return to an office-centric culture as our baseline. We believe it enables us to invent collaborate and learn together most effectively.

The timelines for returning to the office will vary by country depending on the infection and vaccination rates and we expect our return to the office to be gradual. In many parts of Asia our employees are already back in the office. In the U.S. as vaccines become broadly available in the next few months we expect more people will start coming into the office through the summer with most back in the office by early fall. In some countries in Europe we expect in-person working to take longer given recent setbacks. As we get closer to the summer we’ll develop more country-specific plans and post all updates to Inside Amazon under Local News.

As a reminder Amazon offices remain open and about 10% of our corporate population currently works from an office each day. Restaurants cafes and shops in our buildings are planning to re-open soon as well. As always we maintain strong safety protocols such as temperature screenings upon entry physical distancing guidelines face covering requirements office occupancy limits and enhanced cleaning in all offices. As we transition back to the office please continue to follow health authority and local government guidelines.

The health and safety of our employees is and has been our top priority as we’ve thought about how and where people should work during the pandemic. Over the past year teams have done incredible work under difficult circumstances and we’ve learned a lot about the pros and cons of remote work. We look forward to the day in the not-too-distant future when we can again invent together—safely and in person—on behalf of customers.

During the COVID-19 crisis the company is using Amazon Chime SDK to incorporate two-way video communication into its mobile apps so that families of COVID-19 patients have reliable remote communication with the patients and their doctors. CareMonitor a provider of remote health monitoring expanded its platform to monitor the daily health status of COVID-19 patients with low-level symptoms so they can recover from the virus in their own homes. In the CareMonitor app patients are asked daily symptom questions and collect biometric data like temperature heart rate and oxygen saturation to gauge their current health status. The app is integrated with Amazon Chime a set of real-time communications components to send messages and connect via video to health care providers. Current Health is enabling more than 40 hospitals and care facilities in the UK and U.S. to free up beds applying its remote monitoring technology to track patients' vital signs outside of the hospital or clinic. Using a medical device that patients wear on their arms clinicians can continuously monitor patients who are at risk of deteriorating enabling them to perform triage and consult with patients over video.

The Amazon Chime SDK is a set of APIs that removes the heavy lifting associated with designing and maintaining a back end media service allowing focus to be on the application itself.

In this blog post we will provide an example of how a builder could use the new Amazon Chime SDK media pipeline live connector with Amazon Interactive Video Services. IVS is an AWS service that accepts RTMPS streams and make low-latency live video to available to viewers around the world.

What are WebRTC and RTMP?

This feature utilizes WebRTC technology an open source real-time communications project through APIs for web and mobile applications enabling builders to add real-time video and audio into their applications. RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is a communication protocol for streaming audio video and data over the Internet. RTMPS is a secure version of the protocol for streaming audio video and data.

The Amazon Chime SDK Live Connector feature enables live streaming video and audio from a meeting to an RTMP or RTMPS ingestion URL from services like Amazon Interactive Video Service or Amazon Elemental allowing for millions of passive viewers to attend and watch with minimal delay. Other RTMP(s) streaming options include Twitch YouTube and Facebook Live to name a few. A builder can choose a composited layout then start the Live Connector pipeline that works with the existing media pipelines feature of the Amazon Chime SDK already used for media capture. This new capability enables use-cases like hosting large virtual events global town halls and company-wide training with thousands or even millions of attendees.

In this blog post we chose to use Amazon IVS as our RTMPS destination but Amazon Elemental MediaLive is another option. For more information setting up an RTMP input on MediaLive click here.

Prerequisites

AWS SDK or AWS CLI installed

Basic knowledge of Amazon Chime SDK

Basic knowledge of Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)

Run a meeting session with Amazon Chime SDK

Let’s start by creating an Amazon Chime SDK meeting session that you will output to RTMPS. For details how to create a meeting with our demo app running click here. Once you have a meeting session running keep the meeting ID handy as you will need it when creating media live-connector pipeline.

*If you are running our demo app you can see the meeting ID of the meeting session you are currently in on the left bottom corner of the page.

Create an Amazon IVS channel and RTMPS ingest server

In the AWS Console search for Amazon Interactive Video Service. You will be brought to the page below. Click Create channel.

Title your channel a friendly name up to 128 characters and select Default for channel configuration then scroll down.

While Amazon IVS does have Amazon S3 recording capability for this demo you can leave it disabled and click Create channel.

Once your channel has been created you will be presented with a stream key ingest server and playback URL. The playback URL can be played using any media player capable of playing HLS (.m3u8) streams. Amazon IVS has player SDKs for web and mobile for use in your applications but that is beyond the scope of this blog post. If you don’t have an HLS player handy Amazon IVS also has a preview built into the console by clicking the Live stream tab.

Choose your layout parameters and start the Live Connector pipeline

The Live Connector feature is accessed via the AWS SDK or AWS CLI. To get started you’ll first create a JSON file with configuration parameters and the active Amazon Chime SDK meeting ID. Then you’ll create a media live connector pipeline to start exporting to the RTMP(s) to your chosen destination. Also specified in the JSON file you can choose three layout options; active speaker only content share with presenter only or feature content share. For details on compositing see here.

Once you obtain the RTMP(s) ingest server and the stream key that information will go into the JSON file as well. There are examples below of the JSON file and parameters to choose from. As a note the RTMP(s) ingest server and stream key will be concatenated together like this: “<ingest-server>/<stream key>”

1) Active Speaker has one video tile of the active speaker’s video stream and the meeting audio. The video tile will automatically switch to the current active speaker. If the active speaker doesn’t have their camera turned on the video tile will display black screen until an active speaker with video stream appears. Note that in this layout content share is not displayed via the RTMP(s) stream even if content share is present in the Amazon Chime SDK meeting. If content share is needed use option 2 or 3 below.

{ ""Sources"": [ { ""SourceType"": ""ChimeSdkMeeting"" ""ChimeSdkMeetingLiveConnectorConfiguration"": { ""Arn"": ""arn:aws:chime::<account-id>:meeting:<meeting-id>"" ""MuxType"": ""AudioWithActiveSpeakerVideo"" } } ] ""Sinks"": [ { ""SinkType"": ""RTMP"" ""RTMPConfiguration"": { ""Url"": ""<ingest-server>/<stream key>"" ""AudioChannels"": ""Stereo"" ""AudioSampleRate"": ""48000"" } } ] }

2) PresenterOnly is one of the two options with content share enabled. Content share will occupy majority of the screen with the presenter’s video overlayed on the corner you set with PresenterPosition.

{ ""Sources"": [ { ""SourceType"": ""ChimeSdkMeeting"" ""ChimeSdkMeetingLiveConnectorConfiguration"": { ""Arn"": ""arn:aws:chime::<account-id>:meeting:<meeting-id>"" ""MuxType"": ""AudioWithCompositedVideo"" ""CompositedVideo"": { ""Layout"": ""GridView"" ""Resolution"": ""FHD"" ""GridViewConfiguration"": { ""ContentShareLayout"": ""PresenterOnly"" ""PresenterOnlyConfiguration"": { ""PresenterPosition"": ""TopRight"" } } } } } ] ""Sinks"": [ { ""SinkType"": ""RTMP"" ""RTMPConfiguration"": { ""Url"": ""<ingest-server>/<stream key>"" ""AudioChannels"": ""Stereo"" ""AudioSampleRate"": ""48000"" } } ] }

3) Feature content share is the second option with content share enabled. Content share will occupy majority of the screen with other video tiles show on either horizontal or vertical depending on the configuration. The most recent enabled four videos will be shown with presenter video shown on the first tile.

{ ""Sources"": [ { ""SourceType"": ""ChimeSdkMeeting"" ""ChimeSdkMeetingLiveConnectorConfiguration"": { ""Arn"": ""arn:aws:chime::<account-id>:meeting:<meeting-id>"" ""MuxType"": ""AudioWithCompositedVideo"" ""CompositedVideo"": { ""Layout"": ""GridView"" ""Resolution"": ""FHD"" ""GridViewConfiguration"": { ""ContentShareLayout"": ""Horizontal"" } } } } ] ""Sinks"": [ { ""SinkType"": ""RTMP"" ""RTMPConfiguration"": { ""Url"": ""<ingest-server>/<stream key>"" ""AudioChannels"": ""Stereo"" ""AudioSampleRate"": ""48000"" } } ] }

When content is not being shared in either “Presenter only” or “Feature content share” Grid View will be the default layout. In this layout each video stream will occupy a tile and will automatically scale based on the number of video streams in the meeting session. Tiles are automatically arranged in rows and columns based on number of video streams with a maximum of 25 video tiles. A builder can use the SourceConfiguration option in the JSON file parameters (shown below) to have only selected attendees in the meeting show up in in the RTMP(s) stream. Note that if content share begins during in the meeting whatever content share layout you have chosen will be displayed and grid view will disappear until content share stops.

Grid View when no content is being shared on any of the above composited layouts.

Choosing only specific attendees to be streamed

If you would like to choose which attendees (up to 25) in the Amazon Chime SDK meeting are shown on the RTMP(s) stream use the SourceConfiguration parameter in the JSON file to specify which attendees by ID. See that added code block in the example JSON file below. Note that external meeting ID is an optional field and is often the friendly name or other identifier of the attendee that the builder chooses.

{ ""Sources"": [ { ""SourceType"": ""ChimeSdkMeeting"" ""ChimeSdkMeetingLiveConnectorConfiguration"": { ""Arn"": ""arn:aws:chime::<account-id>:meeting:<meeting-id>"" ""MuxType"": ""AudioWithCompositedVideo"" ""CompositedVideo"": { ""Layout"": ""GridView"" ""Resolution"": ""FHD"" ""GridViewConfiguration"": { ""ContentShareLayout"": ""Vertical"" } } ""SourceConfiguration"": { ""SelectedVideoStreams"": { ""AttendeeIds"": [""attendeeID1""""attendeeID2""] ""ExternalUserIds"": [ ""string"" ] } } } } ] ""Sinks"": [ { ""SinkType"": ""RTMP"" ""RTMPConfiguration"": { ""Url"": ""<ingest-server>/<stream key>"" ""AudioChannels"": ""Stereo"" ""AudioSampleRate"": ""48000"" } } ] }

Starting the Live Connector pipeline to begin streaming

Once the layout parameters are determined save the JSON file. Now you will call the API to create the Live Connector pipeline. When you call the API you will pass in the JSON file that contains the parameters including layout meeting ID AWS account ID and RTMP(s) destination (see technical documentation for details).

With the AWS CLI call the below command:

aws chime-sdk-media-pipelines create-media-live-connector-pipeline --cli-input-json file://input.json --region <region>

Note: you could also use AWS Lambda and the AWS SDK with the programming language of your choice to create the pipeline. Please see the Amazon Chime SDK documentation for more details.

Note: API for Live Connector pipeline is available to specified regions (see here) but pipeline can run on meetings running on any regions that Amazon Chime SDK supports.

Once the media live connector pipeline is successfully running you will get a response with the media pipeline id which you will need later to delete or check on the pipeline status. You will also see and attendee named ‘MediaPipeline-XXXXX’ join into the meeting. In a production application you can choose to filter out this attendee so other attendees don’t see the Live Connector bot in the roster.

{ ""MediaLiveconnectorPipeline"": { ""Sources"": [ .... ] ""Sinks"": [ .... ] ""MediaPipelineId"": ""*****-****-****-****-**********"" ""Status"": ""Initializing"" ""CreatedTimestamp"": ""2022-07-11T08:09:37.841Z"" ""UpdatedTimestamp"": ""2022-07-11T08:09:38.090Z"" } }

Check your live stream in the IVS console

Once your Live Connector is running navigate back to the IVS console and to the channel you created earlier. If you click on the “Live stream” tab and press the play button you should see your video stream without the need to setup an HLS player to test.

Cleaning up the resources

There are two ways to stop the running media live connector pipeline. You can call delete-media-pipeline API to stop the pipeline explicitly but let the meeting continue or if the meeting ends the pipeline will automatically stop as well.

aws chime-sdk-media-pipelines delete-media-pipeline --media-pipeline-id ****-****-****-****** --region <region>

If you created an IVS channel following this post’s steps go to the IVS Channels page on Management Console and select the IVS channel and click on Delete to clean up the resource.

If you run Amazon Chime SDK’s browser demo app you can just stop the local server running to clean the resources. Or if you run Amazon Chime SDK’s serverless demo app you can just follow the steps of cleaning up section of the page.

Conclusion

This blog post serves as one example of how a builder could use the new Live Connector feature of the Amazon Chime SDK. RTMP(s) is a common protocol for live streaming video and audio. Any service that supports RTMP or RTMPS ingestion could be used with this new feature and it is not limited to AWS destinations.

Almost half of the shareholders voted in favor of calling on the company to address its growing plastic packaging problem — the highest level of support among the resolutions considered and among all Amazon shareholder resolutions voted on to date. Shareholders are rightfully demanding more from Amazon’s leaders when it comes to sustainability — and their fight must continue.

The resolution comes in the wake of an eye-opening report from Oceana which found that Amazon produced 599 million pounds of plastic packaging waste in 2020 a 29 percent increase since 2019. This plastic packaging waste in the form of air pillows would circle our planet more than 600 times. Amazon’s shoppers are worried about such trends with close to 90 percent of customers concerned about plastic pollution.

Amazon’s deleterious environmental impact extends beyond waste generated from packaging. Last year 600 Amazon employees signed a statement calling on the company to address pollution that is concentrated in communities of color. The retailer’s sweeping warehouse empire tends to extend in ZIP codes that have a higher percentage of people of color — unlike its corporate offices situated in suburban oases such as Palo Alto California and Arlington Virginia.

The company has still yet to fully come clean requesting that its Carbon Disclosure Project report not be shared publicly.

Amazon has no problem touting certain numbers surrounding its sustainability commitments — especially if those numbers are tweaked in a way to portray the company in a positive light. For instance Amazon will only take responsibility for the full climate impact of products with an Amazon brand label — amounting to a mere 1 percent of its online sales. That means the full environmental consequences — the life-cycle of use and disposal — of many products purchased on its vast third-party marketplace are left unaccounted.

Only after being shamed by obtaining the F grade it clearly deserved did Amazon begin to disclose its footprints to the Carbon Disclosure Project a global sustainability initiative. The company has still yet to fully come clean requesting that its report not be shared publicly unlike the majority of companies facing heat from investors for environmentally unsound practices. Even Amazon’s latest sustainability report tucked the disappointing information about its growing carbon footprint — an 18 percent increase from last year — behind almost 100 pages of glossy tidbits about their sustainability efforts.

Although some Amazon shareholders may feel a sense of hopelessness following the recent sustainability proposal’s failure they are on the right track. As one commentator noted after the event even a proposal that hits just 20 percent or 30 percent approval sends a clear message to the board that an issue must be addressed. A growing number of shareholders care about ESG and so do analysts who may downgrade stocks due to the risks that investors’ proposals will expose.

Perhaps without the financial presence of Amazon’s former CEO Jeff Bezos the plastics reporting resolution may have had a shot at passing. Bezos the company’s largest shareholder owns at least 10 percent of the company’s shares giving him the ability to shape the company long after his departure from active corporate leadership.

However there is no indication that Bezos’s influence will be any less significant in the near term. That makes the fight from Amazon shareholders even more necessary and confirms why they must continue to ensure the company’s sustainability commitments are not just empty promises.

There is an ongoing and necessary sea change in how Americans are viewing Amazon — especially around ESG — and the company’s shareholders have an indispensable role to play in this shift."

Amcor says the announcement is in line with its statement in March regarding the scaling down of activities across its Russian operations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24th 2022. In the statement authored by Amcor’s CEO Ron Delia the company said its “first focus is the safety of our people in Ukraine” adding that it had proactively closed its site in Kharkiv Ukraine to protect its local team.

“We are deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and are actively contributing to the relief efforts” Delia wrote. Speaking on Amcor’s values he added: “We recognize that our packaging products help people in communities everywhere with their daily necessities. Our sense of obligation extends also to the multinational customers we partner with in Ukraine and Russia.”

Amcor has operated in Russia for more than 20 years. The company’s three factories in Russia reportedly generate 2% to 3% of total Amcor sales. In the announcement Amcor explained that it would scale down activities in Russia by focusing its manufacturing on supporting only existing multinational customers suspending new projects and investments and discounting exports from the country as soon as possible.

Amcor says it will now sell the three factories. While noting that it is difficult to determine the exact timing the company expects the completion of the sale in the second half of its 2023 fiscal year.

Until completion the company says it remains committed to supporting its employees and customers while preserving value for shareholders through an orderly sale process. The company adds that it is also undertaking proactive initiatives to help offset the future impact of divested earnings.

According to Amcor it accounted for a number of potential outcomes regarding the sale of its factories in Russia in its quarterly and year-end financials for FY22. In the report the company says it expects a negative impact of approximately 2% related to the scale-down and planned sale of its three plants in Russia.

Last month Tetra Pak announced that it would withdraw from all ongoing operations in Russia and divest all business there to local management.

Hers was the shortest tenure for a head of American AAdvantage while also in charge of customer experience and marketing.

Instead of promoting the current managing director of the program (Heather Samp) or bringing in a new Vice President American Airlines is moving the AAdvantage program underneath revenue management which is led by Scott Chandler.

Already the AAdvantage team had been split up between the customer-facing program (which will report up to revenue management) and mileage sales which is headed up by Scott Laurence the executive who bounced from JetBlue to Delta to American in a matter of weeks. Both of those teams report up to Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja.

There are other moving pieces as well such as Caroline Clayton (VP Communications) adding marketing to her portfolio. And they’ll be hiring a new Vice President of Customer Experience who will report to Raja further sidestepping Chief Customer Officer Alison Taylor.

A message from Vasu Cole and Ron: Organizational update Team It is important to make sure our teams remain aligned with the evolving needs of the business. With Julie Rath’s upcoming move to Airports as SVP of Airport Operations we are using this moment as a catalyst to make several adjustments to our organizational alignment. These moves will not only get us better organized against our objectives they also will allow us to lean into great talent and provide expanded roles and responsibilities. Starting with the Commercial organization we are going to split Julie’s soon-to-be open role into three areas of focus and position them in strategic places across the organization. Loyalty will move to Scott Chandler our VP of Revenue Management. Scott’s group oversees all commercial programs including pricing and optimization so we can ensure our initiatives bring value to both the customer and the company. As we know life is better as an AAdvantage member. Adding the AAdvantage team to this organization will make sure our AAdvantage members are able to unlock benefits across the entirety of our commercial programming. With this shift Heather Samp Managing Director of AAdvantage and her team will now report to Scott. Marketing will move into Global Engagement and report to Caroline Clayton who will assume a new title of VP of Communications and Marketing. Combining these two organizations will allow us to seamlessly communicate our commercial programs to our customers and team members in a holistic way via paid earned social and other media channels and platforms. In essence Caroline will serve as our chief storyteller. Dana Lawrence Managing Director of Global Marketing and her team now will report to Caroline. We will hire for a new VP of Customer Experience with that individual reporting to Vasu. The person in this role will be responsible for the physical products and technical touchpoints our customers experience on their journey with us. And this leader will work to make sure we are developing innovative technology that our customers and team members value. We will have more to come in the near future on this role. Both Clarissa Sebastian Managing Director of Customer Journey – Products and Design and Kim Cisek Managing Director of Customer Experience – Digital Transformation will report to the future VP. Concurrent with these moves we will make two additional shifts across Commercial People and Global Engagement:

Leadership Development and Learning Solutions will return to the People team. As we look to ramp up our leadership development and enterprise learning programs in 2023 and beyond the timing is right to better align these programs with our talent development DEI and people business partner teams. Developing and retaining talent has never been more important – and this team plays a key role in this effort. Tracy Salters Director of Global Learning and Development and his team now will report to Cole.



Terrence Bradshaw Director of Talent and Development for the Commercial Team now will report to Quad Kent VP of Global People Support. Making sure our Commercial team attracts and retains the best people in the industry is a priority. Terrence has done a terrific job of helping to source and develop our talent in this area in recent years and this move will further support his team’s work and align these efforts with the People team. As our business continues to evolve so do the organizations we have in place to support the airline. We remain committed to our two primary goals: Running a reliable operation and returning to profitability. These moves set us up for even more success in helping to achieve our goals. Thank you for all you are doing to support American.

Having AAdvantage in the same group as revenue management would make sense if the goal were for AAdvantage to gain access to more saver award inventory. That hasn’t been the trajectory at American which has focused on buying seats outside of traditional saver buckets and more making additional inventory (‘web saver’) available to customers based on prevailing fares.

Instead the explanation for the move is “Adding the AAdvantage team to this organization will make sure our AAdvantage members are able to unlock benefits across the entirety of our commercial programming.” Allowing AAdvantage members to ‘unlike benefits across the entirely of the airline’s commercial offerings’ sounds more like merchandising monetizing the member base. Great offers can still be value-add of course. We’ll have to wait to see how this evolves in practice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF2aWF0b3JtZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zdXBlcnNvbmljLWpldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Orders 20 Boom Overture Supersonic Jets,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.theaviatorme.com/news/american-airlines-supersonic-jets on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF2aWF0b3JtZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zdXBlcnNvbmljLWpldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

By year’s end the tab since Jan. 1 2020 on the Clifty Creek coal plant in Madison Indiana and the Kyger Creek plant in Cheshire Ohio is projected to hit nearly $188 million according to real and projected data from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

Before House Bill 6 passed in 2019 the mostly investor-owned utilities that comprise the Ohio Valley Electric Corp. which operates the plants and sells their power obtained permission from the PUCO to pass on their OVEC losses to customers through around 2024. Those subsidies yielded about $159 million between 2017 and 2019.

HB 6 extended the subsidies through 2030 enshrined them in state law and required all customers statewide to foot the bill — even customers of utility companies with no OVEC ownership. Residential ratepayers pay up to $1.50 per month to subsidize the plants through their electric bills.

American Electric Power owns the largest equity stake in OVEC of the Ohio owners followed by Duke Energy and then AES. They’ve each received $102 million $46 million and $25 million respectively (not counting the narrower subsidies that predated HB 6).

All told the subsidies are expected to cost ratepayers a total of $700 million all flowing to the three investor-owned utilities.

HB 6 as introduced limited its bailouts to nuclear plants owned at the time by FirstEnergy Corp. Other utilities positioned themselves as neutral on the bill but came to support it after the OVEC subsidies were amended in. Environmentalists and other critics of the legislation have characterized the OVEC subsidies as a bargaining chip to get other utilities on board.

Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four allies were charged with racketeering in connection with passage of the bill. Prosecutors alleged they secretly accepted $60 million through a 501(c)(4) nonprofit from FirstEnergy to engineer its passage and enrich themselves. Two alleged conspirators have pleaded guilty and one died by suicide. Householder and one other conspirator await trial. FirstEnergy admitted to the misconduct in a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.

While the nuclear and another FirstEnergy-friendly piece of HB 6 have since been repealed the OVEC subsidies remain on the books. Bipartisan efforts to repeal them have stalled.

On top of its own lobbying and traditional campaign contributions tax records show AEP contributed $700000 into the same nonprofit using an affiliated nonprofit as another pass-through. The company has been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection to HB 6.

OVEC's two plants were originally built in the 1950s to power the federal government’s uranium enrichment facilities near Portsmouth. That agreement ended in 2003. The utility companies that own OVEC last renegotiated their contract in 2011 extending its life through 2040.

The plants are laden with debt after their operators invested heavily on a “scrubber” system to comply with newer environmental regulations. Besides the financial costs the plants are among the dirtiest in the nation having emitted more than 27 million tons of carbon dioxide 26000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 15000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere since January 2020 according to federal emissions data curated by the Ohio Consumers’ counsel.

Utility companies have objected to use of the terms “subsidy” and “bailout” to describe their OVEC charges to customers referring to it as a “hedge” that can act as a customer credit when coal prices rise. The first half of 2021 marks the first instance in its lifetime that OVEC produced a credit to customers. This is attributable in part to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing global economic sanctions against and trade cessation with Russia (a major natural gas producer). The PUCO predicts that OVEC will cost Ohioans about $1 million this year — the lowest on record.

Speaking at a panel event Tuesday AEP executives played up the recent economic success of the OVEC plants while making little mention of the $173 million net loss. Unlike the PUCO AEP Ohio CEO Marc Reitter projected OVEC will continue netting a profit through the rest of the year. Parent company CEO Nicholas Akins also projected optimism.

“We’re planning for the long term and for us there’s going to be ebbs and flows of the market that exists for electricity” he said.

Despite AEP’s lobbying efforts and political contributions in support of the legislation Akins lamented the optics of the ensuing criminal civil and regulatory investigations.

“It certainly was a tainted process. We AEP we focused on it just like we do every piece of legislation. We tried to be helpful” he said. “It made the whole state look bad. And it made all the utilities look bad. And we suffered from that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvc3BlY3Qub3JnL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2luZmxhdGlvbi1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tYWN0cy1xdWlldC1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLW9uLXB1YmxpYy1wb3dlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Inflation Reduction Act's Quiet Revolution on Public Power,"× Expand Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP Photo Vehicles travel down Altamont Pass Road with wind turbines in the background in Livermore California August 10 2022.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has all kinds of goodies in it: tax credits for homeowners and businesses to install rooftop solar or upgrade their appliances credits for electric vehicles money for clean-energy research and much more.

But there are two provisions that have largely flown under the radar in the discussion of the bill. These are “direct pay” and “transferability” which will be two of the biggest drivers of emissions reductions in the power utility sector over the next decade. Moreover the first provision marks a quiet break with decades of American policy orthodoxy and a lesson in the value of public power.

Let me first review some history. There have been two major kinds of clean-energy tax credits: an investment tax credit (ITC) for installing new clean-power generators first passed in the 1970s and a production tax credit (PTC) first passed in the 1990s for actually producing it. They worked just like you’d think: allowing a deduction from one’s taxes for clean-energy investment or production. And to be fair these credits actually have driven considerable investment in clean power and therefore lower emissions.

But there were problems. As this brief from the American Public Power Association explains entities that are exempt from federal income tax—like nonprofit co-op utilities or public institutions like the Tennessee Valley Authority or state-owned utilities—weren’t eligible for these credits. Because public power companies and co-ops provide nearly a quarter of American power generation this created a large roadblock to decarbonizing the electricity sector.

More from Ryan Cooper

Direct pay in the IRA by contrast now means these non-tax-paying entities can receive the credit as a cash payment—basically turning the ITC and PTC into a grant for them. It’s similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit for individuals in which the working poor receive a “tax refund” even though they may not pay anything in federal income tax.

The new ITC base rate is 6 percent while the PTC is 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour produced (though you can only claim one). However if a producer complies with wage and apprenticeship requirements both credits are multiplied by a factor of five—a very strong motivation indeed to provide good jobs.

Transferability meanwhile refers to a change in the rules of these credits. Under the prior tax policy regime entities without enough tax liability to claim the credits could rope in direct investors who did owe a lot in tax (called “tax equity finance”) and therefore make some use of the credit.

But as energy analysts Jesse Jenkins and Leah Stokes explain on David Roberts’s Volts podcast this practice had three problems. First these investors—typically large financial companies like Goldman Sachs—would eat up something like 20 to 30 percent of the value of the credit. That’s both an unnecessary subsidy of Wall Street and cuts down on the effectiveness of the spending. Second while some non-taxed electric producers could figure out these arrangements it is impractical for public power utilities. They could contract with third-party electric producers but such arrangements are complicated and expensive. Third there simply isn’t enough tax owed by Wall Street banks to drive the kind of massive clean-power buildout we need.

“Direct pay” and “transferability” will be two of the biggest drivers of emissions reductions in the power utility sector over the next decade.

Now thanks to the IRA entities can simply sell their credits to anyone with tax liability—no investment necessary. That cuts down the buying party’s share of the proceeds to perhaps 5 percent and greatly expands the available bucket of tax liability that can be used to finance new investment.

Finally the IRA creates for the first time ten years of policy stability. Up until now Congress had written credits to expire after a few years or continually fiddled them up and down which created herky-jerky surges and collapses in investment and chronic uncertainty in the market. Now utilities will have a full decade to plan new projects without having to worry about Congress bothering to re-up the credits (assuming Republicans don’t repeal them somehow).

All told these tax credits and the way they’ve been reformed will drive the largest portion of the IRA’s emissions reduction—modelers estimate a reduction of 360 million metric tons by 2030 or about 37 percent of the total.

In some ways the IRA approach is unfortunately typical of American policy habits where instead of the government just doing what needs to be done it provides tax incentives for private companies to do it instead. But the direct-pay program is actually a major shift from this tradition. Despite its pose as yet another tax credit it is really more like a New Deal social-democratic policy: direct investment of public cash into publicly owned power generation.

When American electricity generation was first being established in the early 20th century private companies built out a crazy tangle of utilities typically owned by utility holding companies that tended to skimp on maintenance and jack prices up as high as they could. Hence a central element of Franklin Roosevelt’s 1932 campaign was his advocacy of strict national regulation of power utilities to rein in these abuses along with direct state ownership of them as he had pioneered in New York state as governor (particularly of hydropower). One result was the Tennessee Valley Authority to this day one of the best-run and most reliable sources of electricity in the country.

Conversely when many of the New Deal–era controls were removed during the deregulation frenzy of the 1990s the result was even worse than in the 1920s—corrupt swindlers at Enron causing blackouts on purpose to rake in easy profits.

While the IRA credits are a huge improvement on the status quo system at bottom there is no reason to involve private capitalists in the power utility business. We’ve known how to generate and transmit electricity for well over a century. Adding renewables complicates the picture but not in a fundamental way. Publicly owned utilities managed properly can and do create and deliver power consistently reliably and without any need to cough up profits for shareholders. If America has any sense we will continue to build on that foundation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWNsaW1hdGVuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzE5MDgyMDIyL2NhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXBsYXlzLWFuLW91dHNpemVkLXJvbGUtaW4tdGhlLWluZmxhdGlvbi1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tYWN0cy1lbWlzc2lvbnMtcmVkdWN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carbon Capture Plays an Outsized Role in the Inflation Reduction Act’s Emissions Reductions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWNsaW1hdGVuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzE5MDgyMDIyL2NhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXBsYXlzLWFuLW91dHNpemVkLXJvbGUtaW4tdGhlLWluZmxhdGlvbi1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tYWN0cy1lbWlzc2lvbnMtcmVkdWN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B95448B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWNsaW1hdGVuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzE5MDgyMDIyL2NhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXBsYXlzLWFuLW91dHNpemVkLXJvbGUtaW4tdGhlLWluZmxhdGlvbi1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tYWN0cy1lbWlzc2lvbnMtcmVkdWN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlLmdvdi91LXMtcmVsYXRpb25zLXdpdGgtY2FuYWRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Relations With Canada - United States Department of State,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlLmdvdi91LXMtcmVsYXRpb25zLXdpdGgtY2FuYWRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9546F80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlLmdvdi91LXMtcmVsYXRpb25zLXdpdGgtY2FuYWRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2RtYWMuY29tL25ld3Mvb3Bpbmlvbi91cy1pbmZsYXRpb24tcmVkdWN0aW9uLWFjdC1zZXQtdG8tbWFrZS1jbGltYXRlLWhpc3Rvcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Inflation Reduction Act set to make climate history,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.woodmac.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/opinion/us-inflation-reduction-act-set-to-make-climate-history/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9546110>, 'Connection to www.woodmac.com timed out.

$200 Hotel Credit: Basic Card Members on U.S. Consumer Platinum Card Account are eligible to receive up to $200 in statement credits per calendar year when they or Additional Platinum Card Members use their Cards to pay for eligible prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts® and The Hotel Collection bookings made through American Express Travel (meaning through amextravel.com the Amex® App or by calling the phone number on the back of your eligible Card) or when Companion Platinum Card Members on such Platinum Card Accounts pay for eligible prepaid bookings for The Hotel Collection made through American Express Travel (meaning through amextravel.com the Amex® App or by calling the phone number on the back of your eligible Card). Please note access to the benefit may take up to 24 hours to take effect on your Card after Account opening. Purchases by both the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on the Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However the total amount of statement credits for eligible purchases will not exceed $200 per calendar year per Card Account. Fine Hotels + Resorts® program bookings may be made only by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic Platinum and Additional Platinum Card Members. The Hotel Collection bookings may be made by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic and Additional Platinum Card Members and Companion Platinum Card Members on the Platinum Card Account. Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Card Members are not eligible for the benefit. To receive the statement credits an eligible Card Member must make a new booking using their eligible Card through American Express Travel on or after July 1st 2021 that is prepaid (referred to as ""Pay Now"" on amextravel.com and the Amex App) for a qualifying stay at an available participating Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection property. Bookings of The Hotel Collection require a minimum stay of two consecutive nights. Eligible bookings must be processed before December 31st 11:59PM Central Time each calendar year to be eligible for statement credits within that year. Eligible bookings do not include interest charges cancellation fees property fees or other similar fees or any charges by a property to you (whether for your booking your stay or otherwise).

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance.

Egencia's boss is adamant that won't be the case with this deal.

In the current climate of travel agency takeovers the president of Egencia has said the business will be a “protected asset” as it gets folded into new owner American Express Global Business Travel which bought it from Expedia last year.

Mark Hollyhead who took over the reins shortly after Rob Greyber’s sudden departure in 2020 believes Egencia was a strategic acquisition. “It’s pretty different to previous acquisitions which were ‘roll-up’ and acquiring quality books of business” he said.

A series of pandemic-era acquisitions are now being ironed out. The Click Travel name has been removed after Spanish agency TravelPerk bought it in 2021. Australia’s CTM meanwhile said its integration of 2020 acquisition Travel and Transport into its North America division “is now largely complete.”

However Hollyhead said if anything it could teach Amex GBT a thing or two.

“Amex GBT is a very young company a lot of times we forget that” he said at the Global Business Travel Association’s convention in San Diego this week referring to when its new life started eight years ago after a deal with Certares. “When we’ve come in it feels like Egencia is a catalyst for change and growth and opportunity to go after this large homogeneous small and medium-size enterprise business.”

Part of that could be put down to the fact Expedia still retains some business interest as an investor in Amex GBT. Expedia’s continuing to provide content to it as well.

Hollyhead said none of its client losses had been “coded” to its acquisition by the world’s biggest corporate travel agency. And existing customers weren’t too concerned. “What’s going to change? Well since the first of November have you seen anything change apart from positive things like within 80 days we’ve got all of Amex GBT’s air content” he said.

“If that’s disruptive sorry about bringing you savings. That’s about the asset being protected and us now taking the best things about Amex GBT and ensuring it’s available to the Egencia client base” he added.

Egencia’s staff have also been pleased by the new owner’s willingness to change and do things differently and the willingness to take on what customers want Hollyhead claimed.

The premise for the brand is that it can act as a stepping stone and smaller companies can use Egencia to go from an unmanaged travel program to a managed one. For the next stage of maturity in their managed program they can graduate to Amex GBT.

Ovation Travel which Amex GBT bought in January 2021 was there for those clients wanting a “high touch” level of service.

“And those three brands going to market it’s a story of growth and scale” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS96ZXJvLWRvbGxhci1yb2FkLXRyaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How I spent $0 using points and miles on an epic Highway 1 road trip,"The Pacific Coast Highway is arguably one of the most iconic and popular road trip routes in the United States. But it's often synonymous with a hefty price tag. Even before this summer of travel chaos rental car prices were spiking and nightly hotel rates up and down California's scenic coastline have never been cheap.

If only there were a way to offset my travel expenses on what has long been my dream road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco.

Let me rewind a bit to give you some context. Yes I work at TPG but I am far from the Maldives-overwater-bungalow-on-American-Express-points type of traveler. I just applied for my first credit card when I started here exactly a year ago.

Since then I have learned many many points and miles lessons from my colleagues and collected three premium and midrange credit cards along the way: the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card and the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express.

I've come to think of these cards as three of my favorite hats. Each is an essential part of my travel wardrobe but I wear them at different times for different reasons.

My Chase Sapphire Preferred is my classic baseball cap. It's versatile and works great as a starting point for any points and miles journey. It earns 5 points per dollar on travel purchased through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal 3 points per dollar on dining and online groceries 3 points per dollar on select streaming services 2 points per dollar on other travel and 1 point per dollar on other purchases. When I applied for it last year I earned 100000 points after making $4000 in purchases in the first three months which can be worth $1250 when redeemed toward travel directly with Chase but which TPG estimates to be worth $2000 based on our points valuations.

My Capital One Venture X is my pink cowboy hat. It's a premium travel card that's super easy to use but makes me feel like a points and miles expert. The Venture X earns 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through the Capital One travel portal 5 miles per dollar on flights booked through Capital One and 2 miles per dollar on all other purchases.

The card's current welcome offer is 75000 bonus miles once you spend $4000 within the first three months from account opening  but when I applied I was able to earn 100000 bonus miles after spending $10000 on purchases in the first six months. Those miles are worth $1000 for travel — potentially more if you take advantage of Capital One's airline and hotel transfer partners.

And my Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express is my tie-dye bucket hat suitable for all those offbeat non-travel occasions where my other cards might not come in handy. It's a great cash-back card for gas and groceries that rounds out the benefits of my beginner portfolio. With this card I earn 6% cash back on up to $6000 of purchases per year at U.S. supermarkets and 3% back at U.S. gas stations and on transit. With my application the annual fee was $0 for the first year before it goes up to $95 (see rates and fees).

Nearly a year into my points and miles card journey I wondered: Could the welcome offers and combined perks of these cards be enough to cover a five-day adventure on the Pacific Coast Highway? You'll have to read on (or watch the video below) to find out.

Preparation

The first step was getting from New York City to the West Coast. Rather than trying to take advantage of Chase's airline transfer partners and search for award availability I simply booked my flights to and from California through the Chase travel portal redeeming points for 1.25 cents apiece. I ended up using 28928 points for a round-trip ticket on JetBlue which saved me $362 out of pocket. My partner Nate and my best friend Dedrick joined in the fun as well but for the purpose of this points and miles budget exercise they paid their own way for flights meals and activities.

We landed at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on a swelteringly hot April morning. But before our adventure could begin we needed to secure the chief ingredient of any classic road trip: the car.

Ours came to us courtesy of Dollar. I used the Venture X to rent our Chevrolet Tahoe for the week for $380 through the Capital One Travel portal since the card offers $300 in annual credits toward travel booked through the Capital One Travel portal. Then I used my Capital One miles to cover the remaining $80 at a rate of 1 cent per mile redeeming a mere 8000 miles for the extra cost of the rental. What's more the Venture X is one of the few travel credit cards that offer primary insurance on rental cars so I knew I'd be protected against any dents or dings we encountered along the way.

Our first order of business was a California classic In-N-Out Burger. And this particular location just a mile away from the entrance of the airport is a prime location for planespotting. The small park across from the restaurant is situated at the end of a runway so over burgers and fries I incorrectly identified airplanes as they passed overhead impressing my aviation-clueless travel companions.

Bellies full we returned to the car and officially anointed the Chevrolet Tahoe the ""Pointsmobile"" by slapping a TPG decal on its side. And just like that the $0 road trip was officially a go.

Day 1: Los Angeles

Where to stay: Book a room at the Tommie Hollywood a chic World of Hyatt Category 4 property. Normally it would cost around $300 a night but instead I spent 15000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points by transferring them to my Hyatt account at a 1:1 ratio. The Tommie screams ""millennial"": The furnishings blend bohemian and midcentury modern aesthetics and the rooftop pool frequently appears in my Instagram feed.

What to do: Swing by the Echo Park Time Travel Mart a literacy nonprofit that operates a kitschy storefront selling books trinkets and ironic snacks (doughnuts from 1985 anyone?). Enjoy your prehistoric goodies on a 45-minute hike to the back of the Hollywood sign which also confers views of the Pacific Ocean Santa Ana Mountains and downtown Los Angeles (on a clear day at least). When it's time for a meal to impress those L.A. friends you see every two years check out Bar Moruno a Spanish tapas restaurant in Silver Lake that opened earlier this year. Make sure you try the oven-roasted marinated feta setas con huevos (a skillet of mushrooms with a fried egg on top) and the Lucky Louie cocktail a tropical concoction with rum sherry lime kumquat and star anise.

Before you head out of town drop by Beverly Hills for a piece of almost-aviation history. Originally built for LAX Jack Colker's 76 Station is the most futuristic gas station you'll ever see that still pumps fossil fuels. Our gas budget for this trip came from the $250 cash-back welcome offer from the Amex Blue Cash Preferred (after spending $3000 in purchases within the first six months). So while I'd consider the gas to be free thanks to that cash back the card also earns 3% back at U.S. gas stations as well as on transit and ride-sharing so I was earning even more cash back toward future purchases.

Day 2: Buellton

Where to stay: Drive 140 miles up the coast of California to Flying Flags an RV resort and campground that also offers tiny cabins and vintage Airstreams and classic camping tents. For our stay we chose the safari glamping tent which had a patio television minifridge and most importantly heat and air conditioning. We used my Venture X to book our stay at this quirky property directly through the website. You can redeem Capital One miles at 1 cent apiece for travel purchases made within the past 90 days so I used 19200 miles to cover the $192 nightly rate.

Flying Flags will make you believe in bipartisanship again. All kinds of people gather here for a dose of Americana (think: bocce balls arcing through the air barbecue sizzling on the grill new friends chatting over shared drinks). Make sure you save one of your Buellton meals for Feather & Fire the restaurant at Flying Flags that no joke serves the best pizza I've had on the West Coast.

What to do: Take a detour to Solvang California a little town a few miles inland that you'll swear served as the real-life inspiration for the ""it's a small world"" attraction at Disneyland. On your way into town stop at OstrichLand USA where you can pay $7 to not only feed ostriches and emus but also gawk at how much they resemble dinosaurs. Grab a table at Paula's Pancake House to eat your weight in fluffy Danish pancakes and syrup-soaked Belgian waffles. Just down the street Renaissance Antiques has an expansive collection of clocks phonographs and music boxes as well as a bespectacled attendant standing by to answer all your most absurd questions.

Day 3: San Luis Obispo

Where to stay: In San Luis Obispo about a 90-minute drive up the highway from Buellton check in for a night at the Madonna Inn. Undoubtedly one of the campiest hotels in the country this SoCal classic is known for its elaborately decorated rooms with themes ranging from ""Jungle Rock"" to ""Cloud Nine."" For our stay we redeemed 18000 points through the Chase travel portal to book the ""Pony Room"" a bright red double-queen suite with a carousel pony in the center that would've been $210 for the night otherwise.

The Madonna Inn feels a bit like a Wes Anderson-designed hotel off the New Jersey Turnpike. (But in a great way I promise!) The property has amenities galore including a pink-and-blue tennis and basketball court a scenic pool with a waterfall feature and live music and dancing nightly in the main dining room. The Madonna Inn fever dream was only interrupted by the shockingly bad yet woefully overpriced dinner menu at its Gold Rush Steak House.

What to do: Head to California Polytechnic State University to check out Poly Canyon a playground for construction experimentation accessed by a 2-mile out-and-back hike. Over the years university students have come here to put their engineering architecture and design degrees into practice erecting dozens of unconventional structures ranging from Hobbit holes to jungle gyms for an alien species. These days graffiti covers most of these marvelous constructions adding to the dystopic effect.

Day 4: Big Sur

Where to stay: Now for one of the more scenic stretches of Highway 1 between San Luis Obispo and Big Sur passing by Hearst Castle along the way.

After a night living like a Royal Tenenbaum we felt like getting back to basics at Ripplewood Resort a wholesome community of cabins. Our abode No. 10 sat nestled just in the tree line and close to Big Sur River on the side of Highway 1. We used my Venture X to book our night at this remote oasis. You can redeem Capital One miles at 1 cent apiece for travel purchases so I used 25000 of them to cover the $250 nightly rate.

Since our cabin was equipped with a full kitchen and an outdoor fire pit we feasted on a well-balanced meal of hot dogs and s'mores with ingredients purchased from a supermarket using my Amex Blue Cash Preferred (which I consider the ultimate grocery card thanks to that 6% earning rate).

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 16 (Photo by Colby Kirkpatrick/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

What to do: On your way up Highway 1 stop for lunch at Harbor Hut an unpretentious seafood joint on Morro Bay. Request a table by the back windows and chow down on a shrimp-and-fries basket while watching for otters and seals. Farther up is Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park where you can visit the eponymous beach famous for its purple sand. (If you're expecting dunes of violet you'll likely be a little disappointed — the name is rather hyperbolic but the setting is still superb.) Later drop by the Henry Miller Memorial Library which is equal parts bookstore creative showcase and monument to the late ""Tropic of Cancer"" author. Here thousands of books hang from the walls and ceiling in clear plastic bags.

Day 5: Monterey

Where to stay: There's only one proper stop left on this itinerary — Monterey the setting of both ""Big Little Lies"" and ""Finding Dory."" (Now that's a crossover episode I'd love to see.) For this stop we opted for an Airbnb using another perk from the Venture X: an up to $200 statement credit for vacation rentals I earned as part of the card's welcome bonus (this is no longer available to new cardholders unfortunately). All I had to do was book the Airbnb using my Venture X within the first year of having the card and a few days later the credit posted to my account.

Atop a mountain in the town of Aptos our solar-powered tiny home was the perfect place to reflect on the 25 years I wasted only using cash to pay for my vacations. The Verizon dead zone forced us to unplug and do things we'd otherwise never take the time to do like lie in a hammock and point out the three constellations I can name on a clear night or read the entirety of the instructions for the composting toilet.

What to do: Price tag aside ($49.95 for adults) the Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best aquarium I've ever been to in the U.S. The sheer scale of the exhibits alone is impressive — not to mention the transfixing beauty of the jellyfish sea turtles and fluorescent schools of fish. After your quick trip under the sea head to Dust Bowl Brewing Co. a train station-turned-brewery that specializes in craft beer. Pick one of the 24 selections on tap and grab a table out back where there are also a few food trucks. Just maybe skip the fish tacos if you're still mulling over your aquarium visit.

Bottom line

My $0 road trip ended up being a smash hit. Not only did I successfully avoid spending even a single dollar out of pocket for my flights car rental gas accommodations and activities but I also learned a massive amount about points and miles along the way.

This experience has taken me from a points and miles infant to well a points and miles toddler. I still have plenty of questions about the world of loyalty programs and credit cards but if this experience has taught me anything it's that sometimes the best way to learn a new hobby is just giving it a try and reaping the rewards.

University of Wisconsin-Platteville senior Isaac Nollen was on the four-person American soil judging team that took first place at last month’s International Soil Judging Competition hosted by the 20th World Congress of Soil Science in Glasgow Scotland.

“The contest was an amazing experience for me” said Nollen a soil and crop science major from Pontiac Illinois. “It feels great to be a part of the first-place team in the world.”

Nollen became involved in the soil judging team on a college visit before even starting at UW-Platteville because he thought it would be a good way to get a fun educational college experience and make new friends at school. He qualified for the international team by placing third in the individual contest at the national soils contest last spring.

“The experience was very educational and I got to make new friends from all across the country and from other countries as well” said Nollen. “Our team worked really hard to [prepare for] the contest so it was really good to see our hard work pay off. Everyone on the team was great to work with and worked well together.”

The event consisted of three days of classroom and field-based training before the two-day competition began.

Nollen’s teammates were Kennadi Griffis of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Ben Atkins and Clare Tallamy of Virginia Tech. The team’s coaches were John Galbraith Jaclyn Fiola and Brian Needleman.

“The entire trip was a wonderful experience” said Nollen. “I ended up really enjoying my time in Scotland especially exploring the soils of Scotland. I am honored to have received this opportunity.”

According to its website the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) is an international scientific society that fosters the transfer of knowledge and practices to sustain global soils.

WASHINGTON August 18 2022 - As Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) continues to deal with the negative impact of the pandemic the World Bank Group (WBG) deployed $20.7 billion to support the region in its just-completed fiscal year (ending June 30 2022).

This brings the WBG support to LAC since April 1 2020 to an unprecedented total of $49.8 billion to fight the health economic and social impacts of COVID-19 as well as support the region’s response to the overlapping challenges of the sharp economic slowdown rising inflation and deepening food insecurity due to the war in Europe among others.

World Bank Group commitments during this period included a combined $24.9 billion from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) typically referred to as the World Bank $19.5 billion from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to promote private sector led sustainable development and $5.4 billion in guarantees by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

“The World Bank Group has provided strong support to the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean reaching a record $49.8 billion in total lending since the pandemic began” said World Bank Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean Carlos Felipe Jaramillo. “As we look beyond COVID our region faces important challenges and we are committed to working together in critical areas such as addressing education losses regaining fiscal sustainability strengthening health acting on the climate change agenda and fostering climate-smart agriculture and the digital economy to build a more sustainable and inclusive growth that benefits the people of Latin America and the Caribbean especially the most vulnerable.”

The World Bank’s financing and expertise this past fiscal year focused on social protection vaccine procurement and deployment strengthening countries’ health systems supporting fiscal sustainability and a green recovery.

In the past fiscal year IFC the private sector arm of the World Bank Group committed $8.7 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean including mobilization ($3.7 billion) and short-term finance ($1.8 billion). Since April 2020 when IFC kickstarted its COVID-19 response IFC has committed $6 billion in liquidity support in the region – both COVID financing outside and through the Fast Track COVID Facility (FTCF) – which has helped expand lending to MSMEs and women entrepreneurs so they can continue operations worked with financial institutions to promote green finance promoted sustainable infrastructure projects and supported export-oriented agribusinesses in region.

“Our priority in the region is to help the private and public sectors work together to overcome crucial development challenges and navigate the economic headwinds that our countries are facing” said Alfonso Garcia Mora IFC’s Vice President for Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean. “In the last 12 months IFC delivered projects with high development impact that help improve people’s lives promote inclusion and help drive the growth of the region’s green economy” he said. “In the last fiscal year 47 percent of our own account investments in this region were focused on climate-smart projects and we are ready to intensify our efforts to strengthen a green inclusive and sustainable recovery so the region can reach its development goals"" he added.

MIGA the world’s leading insurer of non-commercial risks whose mandate is to help drive impactful foreign direct investment to developing countries issued $1.6 billion in new guarantees in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since April 2020 it has issued $5.4 billion for the region.

“MIGA’s guarantees enabled foreign capital to come into the region to help build resilience to shocks like pandemics and climate change” said Junaid Ahmad MIGA’s vice president of operations. “We are pleased that with our help projects such as Port Antioquia a major port in the region were implemented achieving important development goals.”

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic total World Bank Group financing has reached $272 billion to help public and private sector clients fight the health economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lawsuits Raise Questions About Captive Plan,"The owners of one of the oldest insurance agencies in Texas must have felt pretty surprised when they were named in a federal lawsuit brought by an AIG company alleging the agency was part of an elaborate fraud that forged signatures and created fake policies for thousands of residents in apartment communities in the state.

Last month the Sanford & Tatum Insurance Agency founded in Lubbock Texas in 1935 pushed back. In a crossclaim filed in Kentucky the agency principals said that they – like thousands of policyholders around the country – were victims of the intricate and far-flung scheme.

The plan was reportedly led by Brandon White of Kentucky and his Ambassador Captive Solutions. It allegedly used offshore captive insurance cells to give legitimacy to bogus liability homeowners workers compensation accident and health policies according to lawsuit documents and people involved in the case.

“As a result of being a victim of such conduct Sanford has now been further victimized by being sued for conduct it had no knowledge of did not condone and would not have condoned had it known of such conduct” reads the crossclaim complaint by Sanford & Tatum filed in July.

The agency’s principals and attorney declined to comment on the case. But others in the industry said the lawsuit and a similar nationwide class action filed in California against White and Ambassador have renewed concerns about how some captive insurance companies are regulated in the U.S. and offshore; how the arrangements are pitched to people seeking alternative risk solutions; and how much this type of “agency captive” structure may lend itself to abuse.

“Never in my life have I seen anything quite like this” said one captive expert who declined to use his name because of involvement with the cases.

The cases and the types of problems they allege have received little attention in the insurance industry.

“Not many people are aware these issues exist” said Chris Burand an insurance industry consultant with Burand & Associates based in Colorado. “More experienced people have caution and concern and a few have direct experience with these scenarios going sour but most other people have no idea.”

The initial suit was brought in 2020 by Lexington Insurance Co. a subsidiary of American International Group (AIG). It was joined later that year by State National Insurance Co. and National Specialty Insurance based in Texas and owned by Markel Corp.

The carriers argue that White Ambassador and associates were involved in at least seven schemes that sold millions of dollars worth of fake policies to youth baseball teams and leagues to surrogate mothers to a waste-removal company and to construction companies.

“The plaintiffs allege that Ambassador and/or White procured and caused the fraudulent issuance of counterfeit insurance policies certificates and invoices” reads an amended complaint in the Lexington suit filed in 2020 in the Western District of Kentucky. The suit asks the court to bar White and his firms from using the carriers’ names and to turn over profits from the schemes along with treble damages.

White based in the Louisville area has been a consultant in the insurance business for a number of years according to his social media postings and to people who have met him. A 2017 Twitter posting shows him teaching insurance agents at a seminar on captives.

He has denied the fraud allegations and has asked the federal court to dismiss the complaints. In court records White and Ambassador have said the issues stem from contract disputes with the insurance carriers over the use of their names. White and his attorneys did not return phone calls from Insurance Journal.

The plaintiffs have called White’s schemes “brazen” aided by the fact that captive reinsurance programs are “complex multi-party arrangements that require specialized expertise and significant underwriting capacity.” At least $11 million in claims have surfaced since the suits were filed records show.

It all began according to the lawsuits in 2018 when White approached a Lexington and AIG Insurance executive with an idea. The plan was for an insurance broker to sell accident liability and health policies to youth sports leagues. The claims would ultimately be covered by one of the Cayman-based captive cells acting as reinsurers similar to an agency captive structure.

The cells weren’t captives in the traditional sense and weren’t part of a non-insurance business: They were part of an umbrella insurance company called Performance Insurance Co. SPC a segregated portfolio corporation of which White was president.

Ambassador Captive Solutions would serve as an intermediary assisting brokers and dealing with carriers.

Lexington’s involvement was needed because captives are not licensed commercial insurers which often have higher surplus requirements. A licensed commercial insurer would have to issue the policies the lawsuits explain. The captives would then pay a fee to Lexington and would reimburse it for any losses from claims.

The proposition was somewhat unusual but not that far-fetched. Captives of a variety of types are with proper safeguards considered legitimate solutions for hard-to-insure organizations looking to save money on risk management. The agency captive model appears to be more commonly used in offshore domiciles.

For all types of captives the number has grown steadily in recent years. The Insurance Information Institute recorded 3069 captive companies in the U.S. in 2021 a 14% increase over the year before. States across the country in recent years have begun to compete in efforts to have captives set up shop inside their borders.

“It’s been a record year and it’s been driven by the hard insurance market” said David Provost deputy commissioner of Vermont’s Captive Insurance Division. “Insurers are pulling out of some markets; everything’s tough. So companies are thinking: ‘If we can’t get the coverage we need we’ll do it ourselves.'”

Vermont was one of the first U.S. jurisdictions to capitalize on the captive need in the 1980s passing laws that made it attractive for captive insurance companies to be domiciled there – providing jobs and premium-tax revenue to the state. The push for captives gained steam after the federal Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 made it easier for at-risk companies to establish their own liability insurance groups.

Vermont is now number one in the country with some 620 captives domiciled there in 2021 followed by Utah Delaware and North Carolina the Institute reports.

Article: Captives Contribute to Growing Cyber Market

And it’s not just in the United States where captives have blossomed. Captives domiciled in Bermuda Barbados and the Cayman Islands have also grown in recent years topping 1500 last year according to industry reports. It’s not clear how many of those are agency captives similar in structure to White’s model.

The Ambassador lawsuits have led to some finger pointing in the industry. Some have suggested that regulators in the Caymans and in the states along with the direct insurance companies insurance agencies and the insureds themselves provided little scrutiny into White’s companies the wording of the policies or the reinsurance treaties despite the unconventional captive structure.

In many cases understaffed regulatory agencies rely heavily on captive managers’ word industry experts said.

“It’s a faulty model” one industry insider said. Unlike a conventional captive model none of business owners were on the boards of the captive companies and weren’t signatories on any of the bank accounts. “They trusted their broker and trusted Brandon White implicitly.”

The current captives regulatory head at the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority could not be reached about the authority’s review process for captives and the former director declined to comment.

Provost who retires next week acknowledged that regulators do in fact depend on a captive’s own business plan but they also undertake background checks and conduct reviews into companies’ principals and their affiliations.

“I don’t see gross misregulation here” he said. “Something like this would eventually or with due diligence be caught.”

Some U.S. states including Vermont have moved cautiously on agency captives and have only recently begun allowing the practices. Vermont has fewer than five and restricts them to commercial lines only — so White’s practice of insuring sports teams would not have been allowed there Provost explained.

The alleged Ambassador fraud was eventually discovered but not for many months and not by regulators.

“Ambassador and White went to great lengths to hide their fraud and were successful in their deceit—until they got caught” reads the lawsuit complaint by Lexington.

After AIG’s captive division vice president Joe Davina declined to participate in White’s program in 2018 White and company proceeded anyway copying and pasting or forging Davina’s signature on documents showing Lexington as the direct insurer the suit charges. Lexington’s name was used on many fake insurance policies the 2020 complaint reads.

The plan offered the forged policies through Gagliardi Insurance Agency based in Pennsylvania and were purported to be reinsured through a captive cell known as Goldenstar Holdings affiliated with Ambassador and White the suit charges. This was dubbed the “Gagliardi scheme” in the court filings. An Ohio company known as ePremium Insurance Agency also was named in the suit.

Davina was alerted to potential trouble in December 2018 when a third-party administrator for Gagliardi emailed him asking about a formal TPA agreement on the policies. Davina questioned White about it but White said it was a “mixup” by the client.

On that occasion and at least four others AIG officials took White’s word for the apparent miscommunication and did not pursue their concerns until later. Davina could not be reached for comment by the Insurance Journal.

Meanwhile White or someone working on his behalf somehow fabricated an email that looked like it came from Davina tentatively endorsing the TPA plan the suit contends. The TPA forwarded the fake email to Davina who again questioned White but took no further action. Months later in 2019 AIG received an email from a captive cell’s insurance management firm with a reinsurance agreement attached showing Davina’s signature.

Davina emailed back that the document was a forgery. White later apologized for the “misrepresentation” and said the forgery did not come from Ambassador. By then AIG had seen enough. The company filed suit six months later.

“White admitted that Davina’s signature on the forged reinsurance agreement was indeed a forgery but White claimed to be ignorant as to who forged Davina’s signature or why” the May 2020 complaint reads.

White then seemed to backtrack Lexington argues. “Ambassador and White now claimed for the first time that White—contrary to all of his earlier statements—witnessed Davina sign the agreement in May 2019 and back-date it to August 2018” the suit alleges.

Meanwhile State National and National Specialty entered the fray. In September 2020 the two carriers joined Lexington’s lawsuit stating that they were also victims of a similar fraud in Texas known as the “Madera Scheme.”

In that arrangement homeowners’ and liability policies were sold and insurance certificates were issued to thousands of people living in big apartment communities in Texas communities developed by Madera Residential the suit charges. The policies and quota-share reinsurance agreements bore the name of State National but all were counterfeit the carrier said. Sanford & Tatum agency in Lubbock was named in that lawsuit but later filed the crossclaim.

State National’s imprimatur also appeared on workers’ comp auto and liability policies sold to Royal Waste Services Triangle Grading & Paving and Iron Woman Construction along with medical coverage for Omega Family Services for surrogacy mom services in California.

“In furtherance of the seven schemes defendants Ambassador and White forged or caused to be forged the signatures of purported State National executives—at times using signatures for individuals who were never employed at State National—on phony agency and reinsurance contracts to which State National never agreed” the lawsuit reads.

Four months after that suit was joined the youth baseball league in California launched its class-action suit against White Ambassador Performance Insurance Co. Goldenstar and others. The complaint by Del Obispo Youth Baseball Inc. charges violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations or RICO Act. Gagliardi Insurance Services was the broker.

The scheme offered accident and health insurance policies some with million-dollar limits for brain injuries the suit said. Del Opispo paid more than $64000 in premiums to Gagliardi for the forged policies but hundreds maybe thousands of other sports teams and leagues throughout the United States were also duped with the counterfeit policies the league alleges. The parent organization for the cells Performance Insurance Co. had at least 12 segregated cells records show.

In the answer to the complaint White’s attorneys wrote: “If plaintiffs sustained any damages (which is expressly denied) all or part of the damages alleged in the complaint were caused by the acts and/or omissions of other persons or entities including plaintiff for whose conduct defendants are not legally responsible.”

State National and the insureds didn’t find out about the apparent deception until the Gagliardi agency informed them in October 2020 that the policies were the subject of the Lexington lawsuit in Kentucky.

The lawsuits and some in the industry suggest that the alleged fraud was largely done on the front end and the perpetrators could have easily produced counterfeit insurance certificates without the aide of Cayman-based captives. But the existence of actual captive cells may have allowed the alleged schemers to show legitimate financial statements and registrations – if anyone had asked.

One lesson from the episode seems to be that brokers agents and insureds should make extra efforts to verify policies and other documentation when approached by people offering captive and other alternative risk solutions. They should consider seeking an independent review of the programs said those familiar with this type of captive arrangement.

“Agents should not get involved in captives unless they understand the captive’s design at a fairly detailed level they have an E&O policy that covers them and they’ve done due diligence on the program that goes far beyond just liking the person selling the captive solution” said Burand the insurance consultant. “Few agents have this knowledge and I am learning through my E&O work that quite a few people don’t even know captives and reciprocals are not normal insurance companies.”

If agents don’t provide adequate disclosure to clients they could be creating significant executives’ and officers’ exposure for themselves Burand said.

Gagliardi Insurance Services was shut down in late 2020. It is named as a defendant in the Lexington lawsuit and the California class action’s amended complaint added Marco and Dominic Gagliardi in 2021. After the Lexington lawsuit was filed regulators in five states revoked Marco Gagliardi’s producer license. He voluntarily surrendered his California agent license in May of this year.

In June Marco filed for bankruptcy in Pennsylvania. Dominic’s non-resident producer license was revoked in Idaho the state’s insurance department website shows.

White lives in Kentucky and Ambassador Group’s offices are in the state. When asked what steps the Kentucky Department of Insurance has taken in response to the allegations about White a spokeswoman for the DOI said only that the department does not comment about continuing investigations. Records show that White’s agent license became inactive in July 2021.

In March of this year the Texas insurance commissioner ordered White and Ambassador to cease and desist from engaging in any type of insurance business including acting as captive intermediaries. In August 2020 Nevada’s Division of Industrial Relations was one of the first regulatory agencies to perform a check when it asked State National to verify a workers’ compensation policy for Iron Woman Construction.

State National said it did not issue the policy that it was counterfeit. It’s not clear if Nevada’s inquiry triggered any action from the carrier. A month later though State National joined the lawsuit against White.

This summer the assets and liabilities of the Cayman captive cells in the Ambassador program are in the process of being novated or moved to other captive insurance companies court records show. Some of the businesses and groups who bought into the allegedly counterfeit policies have been set up with policies backed by legitimate captive reinsurers.

The umbrella captive company Performance Insurance Co. is in the process of being liquidated. The case is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami.

And CIMA the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority has taken some action against Performance. In December 2020 CIMA issued a cease and desist order barring Performance from writing any more business and said it planned to suspend the company’s Class B insurance license.

AIG attorneys declined to comment on the litigation.

India

Canadian investment group Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) is reportedly in talks to acquire the 21% stake in Indus Towers currently held by beleaguered Indian mobile operator Vodafone Idea the third-largest operator in the country.

According to The Economic Times the stake in Indus which has more than 186000 towers spread across all of India’s 22 ‘circles’ (mobile service areas) could be worth more than 112.7bn rupees ($1.4bn). The largest single shareholder in Indus Towers is Bharti Airtel which has first right of refusal if Vodafone Idea decides to sell to an external investor.

International tower giants American Tower and Crown Castle have previously been linked to talks about the stake.

CDPQ is not totally new to the towers sector: It already holds a 30% stake in US wireless infrastructure firm Vertical Bridge.

Brazil

Brazilian operator Oi which finally completed the sale of its radio access equipment and mobile service operations to a consortium of operators for €2.6bn in April this year has received a binding bid worth almost 1.7bn reals (BRL) ($329m) for 8000 towers.

The offer comes from Highline an independent passive infrastructure company with deployments (towers rooftop and in-building installations and small cells) throughout Brazil and which boasts DigitalBridge as an investor. Highline previously acquired 637 tower sites and more than 200 in-building distributed antenna system (DAS) nodes from Oi for BRL1bn and reportedly made a bid for its mobile operations.

But Highline isn’t the only company interested in the 8000 towers that are up for grabs: Local media reports suggest American Tower which already has almost 23000 tower sites in Brazil and IHS Towers which has almost 6900 sites in the country are poised to make counter bids.

SBA Communications another major towers player in the Latin America region with about 10000 sites in Brazil has not been linked with an offer. It is currently in the process of acquiring about 2600 sites from Grupo TorreSur for $725m a deal that is set to close before the end of this year the company noted in its second-quarter earnings statement.

Africa

Helios Towers is definitely playing the scale game across its target markets in Africa and the Middle East and it appears to be paying off.

The company reported that its recent acquisitions in Senegal Madagascar and Malawi had helped boost its revenues during the first half of the year by 25% year on year to $265.4m but that even excluding the impact of those acquisitions its revenues still grew by 12% compared with the first half of 2021 due mainly to an increase in the number of customers using its assets. Its operating profit grew by 48% year on year to almost $40m.

Its total number of sites increased by 2091 compared with a year earlier to 10694 sites on 30 June with the addition comprising 1213 acquired sites in Malawi and Madagascar and 878 organic sites.

And Helios has some more M&A deals in the works as it is acquiring Oman Telecom’s towers unit as part of a joint venture with Rakiza Telecommunications Infrastructure (in which Helios will hold a 70% stake) and is on course to acquire Airtel Africa’s towers in Gabon.

In total Helios expects to spend $650m on M&A deals this year.

The sites submitted for consideration as part of the organization’s East Austin Barrio Landmarks Project represent part of an ongoing effort by local historians to document and preserve the diverse cultural heritage of these landmarks amidst the rapid growth of East Austin.

The approved sites include beloved East Sixth Street restaurant Cisco’s the district’s Pan American Neighborhood Park and two homes important to local Mexican American politics and activism — here’s a closer look at each site:

Cisco’s Restaurant & Bakery — 1511 East Sixth Street

The teal brick building at the corner of East Sixth and Comal Streets serves migas and other breakfast favorites but Cisco’s is really famous for its past as a political powerhouse with patrons including congressmen governors and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Founded in 1950 by civic leader Rudy “Cisco” Cisneros also known as the “Mayor of East Austin” the restaurant hosted political fundraisers and other events — “If a politician wanted the East Austin vote he had to come to Rudy” according to Preservation Austin’s description of the site. After Rudy’s death in 1995 the restaurant passed from his son Clovis to a group of investors including Cisneros’ grandson Matt in 2017. They’ve added a few menu items but the place hasn’t changed too much.

Pan American Neighborhood Park — 2100 East Third Street

An important gathering place for the region’s Mexican American community since 1942 Pan American Park and its recreation center are known for a history of boxing baseball and countless performances by Tejano musicians at its Hillside Theater — including an early appearance by Selena Quintanilla. The recreation center also includes murals dating back to 1978 painted by local artist Raul Valdez marking the cultural heritage of the neighborhood.

Herrera House — 1805 East Third Street

According to Preservation Austin’s own research this strikingly teal-colored house near Third and Chicon Streets has hosted three well-known Mexican American educators and community activists over the last century all of them women:

These women were Consuelo Herrera Mendez after whom Mendez Middle School is named; her younger sister Mary Grace Herrera; and their niece Diana Herrera Castañeda. Consuelo and Mary Grace were the first Mexican American teachers in the Austin Independent School District (AISD) teaching at several schools––including Zavala Elementary and Palm School––for 45 and 35 years respectively. Both women fought to desegregate Austin schools and provide equitable resources and opportunities to Mexican American citizens. Diana was the first Latina to be elected to the AISD board and was a tireless East Austin activist.

Richard Moya House — 1102 East Cesar Chavez Street

This 1930s Craftsman-style bungalow on East Cesar Chavez Street served as the longtime home of local Chicano politician and activist Richard Moya the first Mexican American elected to public office in Austin and Travis County in 1970. Originally Moya’s childhood home since 1952 he used the house starting in the 1970s as a campaign headquarters and space for fundraisers election nights and phone banking. Later occupied by creative offices the home now serves as event space with its interior still similar to its appearance during Moya’s use of the property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvYnJhemlsLXRlbGVjb20tdG93ZXJzLWF1Y3Rpb24tZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tZHJhdy11LXMtYmlkcy1yZXBvcnQvOTM2NjU5NDPSAX1odHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9icmF6aWwtdGVsZWNvbS10b3dlcnMtYXVjdGlvbi1leHBlY3RlZC10by1kcmF3LXUtcy1iaWRzLXJlcG9ydC85MzY2NTk0Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brazil telecom towers auction expected to draw U.S. bids: Report,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The company has partnered with Ubuntu Towers Uganda and American Tower Company (ATC) to connect 250 network sites countrywide to the hydroelectric grid this year in a bid to minimize the use of fossil fuel in its operations and help achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

This is in line with its environmental social and governance principles premised on the belief that the company’s growth and success should not come at the expense of the planet. MTN Uganda has approximately 3000 network sites countrywide.

MTN Uganda’s Acting Chief Executive Officer Andrew Bugembe said MTN Uganda has set a science-based target to achieve a 47% average reduction in absolute emissions which stands for tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent for scopes 1 2 and 3 by 2030.

Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources while scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity steam heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions in a company’s value chain.

“Climate change is one of the greatest threats to humanity in recent times and MTN Uganda has a big part to play in fighting this global crisis” Bugembe said.

Bugembe said MTN Uganda’s bold step provides the best opportunity to implement its vision of creating shared value for all the stakeholders through responsible economic environmental and social practices.

He said added that the company’s current and future investment in infrastructure modernizations has also emphasized enhancing efficiency and aligning with the ESG goals on environmental sustainability.

According to the UN the earth expects to record a sharp increase in temperatures past a key danger point unless greenhouse gas emissions fall faster than countries agreed.

In the 2015 Paris Agreement countries committed to limiting the global average temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to aim for 1.5°C.

Uganda has already experienced various climate change-related hazards including drought and the recent flash flooding in Mbale that left at least 30 people dead and 5600 others displaced.

MTN Uganda has also initiated various projects to promote sustainable growth and development including a 50 hectares of forest restoration in Ogera Hills Central Forest Reserve in Serere district and a 20 hectares forest restoration in Kyewaga Central Forest Reserve in Entebbe among others.

MTN Uganda has also partnered with Fenix International to develop an ultra-affordable Pay As You Go energy solution to deliver safe lighting phone charging and more to those living off-grid across the country.

New Jersey regulators have approved a water and sewer rate increase for New Jersey American Water about half the amount the utility initially requested. A typical residential water bill will increase $2.92 a month or 4.7% on Sept. 1.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) on Wednesday approved a settlement between the company the BPU staff the New Jersey Rate Counsel or public advocate and several intervenors.

New Jersey American which has 660000 water customers and 50000 sewer customers is the state’s largest private water company with service to all but three of New Jersey’s 21 counties. Its drinking water is piped to more than 70 communities in Camden Burlington and Gloucester Counties including 49 towns where it is the retail provider and about two dozen towns where it is the wholesale supplier.

For water customers the typical monthly bill for a customer using 5520 gallons a month will increase from $62.39 to $65.31 or 4.7% Denise Venuti Free a company spokeswoman said in an email on Thursday. The company has several rate zones with different charges depending upon when it took over service in those municipalities.

For sewer customers who are located in 11 of the state’s 21 counties the average monthly residential bill will increase by $3.75 or 5.8% from $64.34 to $68.09. Average sewer bills are also based on average water usage of 5520 gallons a month.

Detailed rates will be spelled out in a tariff that New Jersey American says it will post on its website on Sept. 1 when the new rates go into effect.

The new rates will generate $45.5 million more in annual revenue or less than half the $94.7 million New Jersey American sought in its January rate filing.

The rate boost amounts to a 5.7% increase in the company’s current $803 million in annual revenues according to the BPU’s order down from 11.7% in the initial request.

In its filing with state regulators the company said the rate increase was primarily driven by its investment of $985 million in infrastructure improvements through the end of 2022 including $454 million during the 12 months ending June 30 2022 and $272 million more for the final six months of this year.

“We are proud of the level of investment we are able to make into our systems to continue to provide high-quality reliable service even through extreme weather and other challenges including the pandemic while maximizing efficiencies to balance the impact to customers” Mark McDonough the president of New Jersey American said in a statement.

The approved $45.5 million rate increase is based on a return on equity of 9.6% on the company’s total “rate base” or investment of $4.15 billion. That’s the same return on equity that New Jersey American was awarded in its last rate increase in 2020 the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbS5yaWNobW9uZGZyZWVwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2F1Zy8xOC93YXRlci1jb25zdW1wdGlvbi1kb3duLW5vdC1jb3N0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water consumption is down but not the cost,"Why is the cost of drinking water going up?

One surprising reason is that people are using less water in their homes businesses and factories in Richmond and across much of the country.

Consumption of public water has dropped an astonishing 28 percent in Richmond in the past two decades according to the April Bingham director of the Department of Public Utilities reducing revenue and forcing the utility to raise rates to maintain financial stability.

The American Waterworks Association reports that consumption has remained flat or declined for two-thirds of the member companies in the face of population growth as consumers embrace the conservation philosophy.

Conservation or the concept of using less of a resource to get the same result has been all the rage in recent decades. Finding ways to reduce water use has fueled an engineering revolution resulting in more efficient water-using appliances like washing machines and an overhaul of water-wasting industrial processes.

Today efficient low-flow toilets can tackle the job with 1.5 gallons of water compared to old-fashioned toilets that used 5 gallons — a big deal given that flushing can account for up to 30 percent of a household’s water use according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Such efficiency draws praise and claims of savings for consumers who jump on the conservation bandwagon. For example those who install low-flow toilets are told they could cut $230 a year from their water bills.

But there is little mention that the savings are illusory because the efficiencies create benefits for customers but do not affect the expenses that producers of the water or the other resources must lay out to create the product.

But water which everyone must have is one of the best examples.

In 1999 DPU sold about 11.2 billion gallons of water Ms. Bingham stated. Fast forward 23 years and sales have dropped to around 8 billion gallons as of June 30 she stated.

The chart shows that the big declines have occurred among three categories of customers: residential industrial and commercial.

Ms. Bingham noted that such savings do not travel to DPU’s bottom line or change the costs of operating a plant that can generate 132 million gallons of drinking water daily

Estimates based on the 1999 rate for water indicate the decline in use has cost DPU a minimum of $8 million a year.

One the one hand DPU is “committed to protecting the environment” Ms. Bingham stated “which includes promoting conservation and responsible water stewardship.”

One the other hand it also needs to sell more water or raise the price to account for the reduction in use if the plant is to continue to produce quality water.

“A large portion of the water utility’s costs are fixed” Ms. Bingham stated. The utility needs a certain amount of income to cover such expenses as chemicals power operations and maintenance none of which fall because less water is sold.

Wages for DPU employees also do not go down when consumers reduce water use. Nor does DPU’s need to borrow and repay the debt to replace the aging network of piping some of which dates back 100 years or more.

“Even if costs are held current levels” Ms. Bingham stated the utility would need to raise the monthly service charge or increase the price of the water” if volumes continue to fall a trend DPU expects to continue “for the foreseeable future.”

She stated that the rate re-structure could reduce the impact on residential customers. DPU plans to conduct a study of the cost of service in 2023.

“We will work diligently to ensure rates are fair and adequate to cover costs” she said.

There has been an impact already.

Water rates have increased three to seven times since 1999 though the cost is still negligible compared with the $1 a gallon that consumers pay for filtered bottled water.

In 1999 residential customers paid 72.8 cents for 748 gallons or .0009 per gallon or one-ten thousands of a penny.

This year the cheapest rate for residential is $2.85 for 748 gallons or .0038 — essentially about one-third of center. (748 gallons is equal to 100 cubic feet of water or 1 ccf; city water meters measure use in ccfs.)

The impact also is felt on the cost of treating the water after it goes down the drain and into sewer piping. In 1999 the residential charge was $1.185 per ccf of wastewater; today the charge is $7.985 per ccf.

Overall according to DPU residential customers can expect to pay bills of more than $100 a month for tap water and wastewater service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTkvZGlyZWN0LXBvdGFibGUtcmV1c2Utd2h5LWRyaW5raW5nLXdhdGVyLWNvdWxkLWluY2x1ZGUtcmVjeWNsZWQtc2V3YWdlLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8xOS9kaXJlY3QtcG90YWJsZS1yZXVzZS13aHktZHJpbmtpbmctd2F0ZXItY291bGQtaW5jbHVkZS1yZWN5Y2xlZC1zZXdhZ2UuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's in your drinking water? If you live in one of these states it might soon be recycled sewage,"The idea of drinking water that was recently sewage swirling down your toilet bowl shower drain or kitchen sink may sound pretty icky. But experts say it's actually nothing to be squeamish about — and it might be coming to your state and city soon. It's a water recycling method known as direct potable reuse or DPR which sends highly treated sewage water almost directly to a drinking water system for distribution to communities. It's legal in Texas and legal on a case-by-case basis in Arizona. Multiple other states are in the process of formulating regulations to legalize it too including California Colorado and Florida. The water produced by DPR meets federal drinking water quality standards experts say. And there's a growing movement to urge people to warm up to the idea of DPR and other sewage recycling methods which were once dismissively labeled ""toilet-to-tap."" ""People need that change in mindset forgetting where your water came from and focusing more on how clean it is when it's in front of you"" Dan McCurry a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California tells CNBC Make It.

Recycling wastewater can help avoid drinking water shortages

The process might not sound appetizing but DPR can prove invaluable when drinkable water becomes scarce. Climate change alters patterns in rain and snowmelt which sends less fresh water to crucial natural drinking water sources like the Colorado River Lake Mead and Lake Powell — all of which face severe water shortages amid extreme drought conditions. Growing populations that demand more drinking water will only stretch those sources thinner making methods like DPR all the more essential. Two cities in Texas — Big Spring and Wichita Falls — have used DPR to bolster drinking water supply so far. El Paso is planning to follow suit alongside major cities like Los Angeles and San Diego once state DPR regulations are in place. Wichita Falls implemented DPR for about a year starting in July 2014 as an emergency solution to a harrowing five-year drought. Chris Horgen the city's public information officer says DPR produced 5 million gallons of treated water each day for the city representing a third of the drinking water distributed to taps. ""The state was that close to delivering water bottles to us in that final year"" Horgen says. ""That's what would've happened without DPR."" In El Paso DPR isn't live yet but the project is underway with a goal of building a long-term sustainable drinking water supply. Diversifying the city's drinking water sources could better prepare it for severe droughts that threaten natural sources like river water says Christina Montoya communications and marketing manager at El Paso Water Utilities. ""It's a way to make sure that El Paso will thrive 50 years out from now"" she says. ""We can't just be planning when an emergency happens. We need to be planning all the time for the future.""

Wastewater recycling is nothing new

If you're still feeling squeamish about DPR know that it's nothing new: There might already be recycled sewage in your drinking water. Several cities in the U.S. have used a similar system called indirect potable reuse or IPR for decades. In that system sewage water is treated at a wastewater treatment plant which cleans it to a level that meets the standards for irrigation or for watering land and crops. The water then gets sent to an advanced purification facility which McCurry says cleans the water even more typically putting it through a three-step process that ensures it meets or even exceeds state and federal standards for drinking water quality. By this point the water is clean. Still it then goes into an ""environmental buffer"" like an underground aquifer where it can spend months or even years to undergo further filtration. Finally it goes to a drinking water system for distribution McCurry says. DPR cuts out that environmental buffer step eliminating time cost and energy from the process McCurry says. In some cases the water gets sent directly to taps. In other cases it gets mixed with raw water — like lake water for instance — before entering distribution. Research shows that advanced purification facilities can consistently treat sewage to safe drinking standards without that extra step of an environmental buffer which is ""really not necessary"" says Patricia Sinicropi executive director of water industry trade association WateReuse. ""That technology can really take any type of water from any source and purify it to the point where the average consumer will have a good experience drinking it"" she says.

Contact: Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov

IRVINE CA — Following a tour of the Syphon Reservoir Improvement Project at the Irvine Ranch Water District today Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton announced the allocation of $309.8 million in funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and $1 million in appropriated funding for the planning design and construction of water reuse projects across the country. The selected projects will advance drought resilience and are expected to increase annual capacity by about 213000 acre-feet of water enough water to support more than 850000 people a year.

The announcement caps a two-day swing through central and southern California to highlight how investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help address the worsening drought crisis and expand access to clean drinking water for families farmers and wildlife. On Wednesday Secretary Haaland Commissioner Touton and federal state and local leaders visited with farmers and water users in Fresno to discuss water solutions for farmers and highlight investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

“Water is essential to everything we do and it will take all of us working together to address the significant drought impacts we are seeing across the West. As the climate crisis drives severe drought conditions and historically low water allocations President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making historic investments to address water and drought challenges and invest in our nation’s western water and power infrastructure” said Secretary Haaland.

""Water reuse helps communities diversify their water supply as they are facing an unprecedented drought and a changing climate"" said Commissioner Touton. “This has tangible impacts and can help feed families grow crops sustain wildlife and the environment and help more families access safe clean reliable water. These projects will provide flexibility for communities and help them stretch their current drinking supplies as they will be treating wastewater that continues to be available.""

Funding will support local water management agencies with stretching existing drinking water supplies and helping to ensure that growing water needs can be met through the advanced treatment of wastewater and naturally impaired surface and groundwater. Along with non-federal contributions today’s investment will support an overall $1.2 billion in infrastructure projects.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates $8.3 billion for Bureau of Reclamation water infrastructure projects to repair aging water delivery systems secure dams complete rural water projects and protect aquatic ecosystems. The funding announced today is part of the $1 billion in WaterSMART Water Recycling and Reuse grants provided by the Law. The Department previously announced $52.2 million this year in WaterSMART grants funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support water and energy efficiency projects and conserve watersheds and restore aquatic habitats.

The company has signed an 11-year lease for more than half of a 118906-square-foot office building at 30601 Agoura Road near its current smaller base of operations in the adjacent Agoura Hills Business Park.

Construction on its part of the building – nearly 76000 square feet – is expected to start in January. The company is anticipating moving there in the second half of 2023.

Even after the move A2 Biotherapeutics will continue to maintain its present site. The company has been at the 30000-square-foot location since September 2018.

""We are excited to expand here in Agoura Hills by building a state-of-the-art facility and be part of the growth of the life science cluster along the Highway 101 corridor"" the company's CEO Scott Foraker said in a statement Thursday.

Off and running: Proposed Amgen mixed-use project clears first hurdle in Thousand Oaks

The Conejo Valley which stretches from a portion of Calabasas through Newbury Park is home to numerous biotech firms including life sciences giant Amgen Atara Biotherapeuticsand Takeda all in Thousand Oaks.

Also located in the valley is Westlake Village BioPartners a venture firm focused exclusively on investing in life sciences.

A2 Biotherapeutics was founded in January 2018 by Alexander Kamb a former Amgen executive. Foraker is a former Amgen executive too.

They say the firm is pioneering a radical new way to treat solid tumor cancers.

Greetings: Home of Amgen Thousand Oaks puts out welcome mat for other biotech businesses

The two-story building that will serve as the company's new headquarters was acquired for $19.3 million in a joint venture of commercial real estate investors Harbor Associates and Platform Ventures the firms said Wednesday.

Harbor principal Rich McEvoy said his company hopes to attract more life sciences companies to lease other parts of the property.

“We were able to identify a well located building that was prime for multi-tenant life science conversion while helping A2 Bio meet its business objectives” he said in a news release.

He said Harbor is also aiming to bring more biotech firms to the 114325-square-foot business park which the company bought in January 2020.

McEvoy said Agoura Hills in the eastern part of the Conejo Valley is convenient for recruiting bio tech talent from the nearby San Fernando Valley and other parts of Los Angeles.

Collagen I coated plates were used for all cell culture experiments described herein. Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs BioIVT lot WWQ) were overlaid with 0.25 mg/mL Matrigel. 24 h after seeding cells were treated with free fatty acids (FFAs) consisting of a 1:1 ratio of BSA-conjugated Oleic acid and Palmitic acid (100 150 200 and 250 µM) with concurrent treatment with Gimeracil (50 100 150 175 200 250 300 750 1500 nM). 48 h after seeding cells were fixed stained with LipidTox (ThermoFisher H34475) imaged on a Perkin-Elmer Operetta and analyzed with a Harmony image analysis pipeline identifying nuclei count LipidTox sum intensity/cell and LipidTox spot area/cell area. Experiments were repeated with additional lines of PHHs (BioIVT lots JEL and RVQ). Additional samples were assessed for viability with a Live/Dead assay (ThermoFisher L3224) 24 h after treatment with 200 µM FFAs and DPYD inhibitor bromovinyl uracil (50 100 250 and 500 nM). Cells were imaged and analyzed on an Incucyte Zoom.

For the mitochondrial respiration assays the Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer was used with the Mito Stress Test assay according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. PHHs were seeded onto XF96 cell culture microplates. 24 h after seeding cells were treated with Gimeracil (50 200 400 and 1000 nM). 24 h later cell media was changed to Krebs–Henseleit buffer (pH7.4) containing 2.5 mM glucose 0.5 mM carnitine and 5 mM HEPES. 30 µL of Palmitate-BSA or BSA control was added to the microplates immediately prior to loading onto the instrument. All data was normalized to protein content with a BCA assay.

For RNAseq experiments PHHs were treated with Gimeracil (50 200 and 400 nM) for 24 h and then treated with FFAs. 24 h after FFA exposure RNA was isolated from cells with the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed by Novogene and sequencing reads were aligned to human transcriptome reference (GRCh38.p12) and gene counts were quantified via STAR after quality control on fastq files. The differential expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2 R package and pairwise comparisons were made between groups. The significant criteria are padj < 0.05 and |log2(FoldChange)|> 1. The differentially expressed genes were then applied to clusterProfiler for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis with default settings. GO terms with padj < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differential expressed genes. In addition clusterProfiler was also used to test the statistical enrichment of differential expression genes in KEGG pathways. KEGG terms with padj < 0.05 are considered as significant enrichment31.

Quantitative PCR was performed to validate RNA Sequencing results (Taqman primers in Supplemental Table 3). Following reverse transcription with Superscript Vilo IV kit RT-PCR was performed with QuantStudio 5 instrument. The geometric mean of three housekeeping genes (GAPDH β-actin and UBC) was used to normalize the data. The delta delta Ct method was used to calculate fold change in expression relative to DMSO treatment (0 nM Gimeracil) with and without 200 µM FFA exposure. BSA was used as the vehicle control for FFA treatment.

Quantification of uracil levels in media collected from PHHs treated with Gimeracil

PHHs (BioIVT Lot WWQ) were cultured as described preciously and cells were treated with Gimeracil solubilized in DMSO and diluted to the following concentrations 5 10 20 50 75 100 200 and 500 nM. DMSO was delivered as vehicle control. 48 h after seeding (24 h after treatment) media and cell pellets were extracted for analysis.

Protein precipitation was used for small molecule extraction from cells or media with methanol. Isotopically labelled uracil (Uracil-2-13C15N 2  Sigma) was spiked in as internal standard. Calibrating solutions were prepared in blank media or untreated cell lysates with concentration range of 50 to 5000 ng/mL and 100 to 5000 ng/mL respectively. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared separately from standard solutions for the calibration curves.

All samples were analyzed using the Acquity UPLC System coupled to the API 6500 QTRAP LC/MS/MS system. For chromatographic separation of the analytes a Waters Acquity HSS T3 column (1.8 µm 2.1 × 50 mm) was used. The mobile phases for chromatographic separation consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). The total analysis time was 2 min per injection. The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the gradient was started at 100% solvent A(0.25 min). Within 1.25 min the ratio was changed linearly to 90% solvent A and 10% solvent B. Within the next 0.05 min the ratio was changed to 10% solvent A and 90% solvent B and kept stable for 0.2 min. Finally the gradient returned to the starting conditions for the last 0.5 min. The column temperature was kept at 55 °C during all measurements while the sample temperature was kept at 5 °C.

Samples were ionized with 150 °C source temperature. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis was carried out. The transitions from precursor ions to product ions monitored in the positive ion mode for uracil and IS were 113- > 70 and 116- > 70 respectively.

In vitro functional characterization of human DPYD mutants

Two gene block fragments coding for DPYD (Supplemental Table 1) were inserted into a pET28a( +) expression vector using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit. Site directed mutagenesis (Agilent’s QuickChange II kit) was performed using mutagenesis primers detailed in Supplemental Table 1. DHα5 cells were transformed with mutant expression vectors and confirmed through Sanger sequencing at Genewiz (Cambridge MA).

WT and mutant vectors were used to transform BL21(DEC3)pLysS cells in Luria–Bertani broth medium containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml). After the overnight growth the starter culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of culture medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin 100 µM uracil 10 µM of sodium sulfide 10 µM ammonium ferric citrate 10 µM of flavin adenine dinucleotide and 10 µM flavin mononucleotide. When the culture reached an optical density at 600 nm (8 to 10 h at 30 °C) 0.5 M final IPTG was added. Cells were harvested and stored at − 80 °C.

Purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cell paste was suspended in BugBuster solution (Millipore 70921) that was buffered in 25 mM Tris–Cl containing 250 mM NaCl 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.05 mg/ml Benzonase I 1.25 mM DTT and 0.2% Tween 20 pH 8.0 (buffer A). The resuspended cell pellet was incubated on ice and underwent ultra-centrifugation for 15 min at 40000g. The supernatant was collected and loaded onto a PD 10 column (pre-equilibrated with buffer A) that was prepacked with 2 ml slurry cobalt beads following the manufacture's instruction and then eluted with 10 volumes buffer A followed by another 10 volumes of the same buffer with additional 0.5 M NaCl. Subsequently another 10 volumes of buffer A with an additional 10 mM imidazole was used to elute the column. Finally 2 volumes of buffer A with 0.3 mM imidazole followed by another 2 volumes of buffer A with 0.5 mM imidazole was applied. The fractions of the imidazole elution were pooled together and concentrated using an Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (MWCO = 15000 Da). After removal of the precipitated protein by centrifugation concentration was assessed via Nanodrop.

Initial velocities of the DPYD reaction were assayed fluorometrically by monitoring the depletion of NADPH at E x /E m = 340/460 nM at 25 °C in a 384-well plate using SpectroMax. Continuous measurement was carried out for 30 min. The extinction coefficient of NADPH was determined by the E x /E m = 340/460 read out of NADPH which was serially diluted from 50 µM to 50 nM. The standard reaction contains 100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) 0.1 mM NADPH varying concentrations of uracil (i.e. 16 nM to 20 µM) and 2–6 nM enzyme in a total volume of 12 µL. The kinetic data was fit into a Michaelis–Menten or a substrate inhibition model21.

Screening of hepatocarcinoma cell lines

Hepatocarcinoma cell lines were selected for their gene expression levels of DPYD and UPP1 enzymes: HUH7 (JCRB0403) Skhep1 (HTB-52) SNU387 (CRL-2237) SNU449 (CRL-2234) and SNU475 (CRL-2236) (all purchased from the ATCC except HUH7 purchased from Xenotech). RNA was extracted from cell pellets with the Qiagen RNeasy mini isolation kit reverse transcribed with the VILO IV reverse transcription kit and quantified gene expression levels of GAPDH B-actin RSP-20 UPP1 and DPYD through digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) (Supplemental Table 3).

Cell lines were seeded in RPMI media containing 10% FBS and changed to serum-free RPMI after 24 h. 48 h after seeding cells were treated with FFAs and bromovinyl uracil (50 100 ad 250 nM). Exposure to FFAs above 100 µM was cytotoxic. Plates were fixed and stained with LipidTox and imaged following the same protocol as outlined for PHHs.

Generation of gain and loss-of-function DPYD mutant SNU449 lines with CRISPR-Cas9 homology directed repair and non-homologous end joining

Two guide RNAs were designed to target the DPYD L310S locus32. These guide RNAs were generated with the Precision GuideRNA synthesis kit with primers ordered from IDT (Supplemental Table 1). Single strand DNA oligos were designed with phosphoorothioate linkages to promote intracellular stability (Supplemental Table 1). Guide RNA quality and quantity was determined with both a Small RNA bioanalyzer kit and Broad Range RNA Qubit kit. Optimal concentrations of guide RNA Cas9 enzyme and ssDNA oligo (10 µg of guide RNA 5 µg of Cas9 enzyme and 10 µg of ssDNA oligo) were combined to maximize both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology directed repair (HDR) efficiency. Guide RNA Cas9 enzyme and ssDNA oligo were combined in SF solution and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cas9 enzyme and the control Nucleofector GFP plasmid were incubated together in SF solution as a control.

The SNU449 cell line was pelleted (200000 cells per reaction) and resuspended in SF solution containing guide RNA Cas9 enzyme and ssDNA oligo. Nucleofection (96 well Nucleofector plate 20uL) was performed according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol for HepG2 cells. Following nucleofection cells were resuspended in 10% FBS in RPMI media. Half of the cells were genotyped and the remaining were expanded. Genomic DNA was extracted with directPCR lysis buffer and Proteinase K (0.4 mg/mL). Proteinase K was inactivated at 95˚C and DNA was genotyped with a ddPCR-based assay (primers/probes outlined in Supplemental Table 1). Thermocycling conditions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the probe supermix containing no dUTP. Guide 1 was selected for future experiments as NHEJ editing efficiencies were superior at 98% efficiency.

HDR efficiencies for the generation of the L310S mutation were estimated at 9%. The bulk population was then expanded for one passage seeded at single cell density and expanded for 3 weeks in culture. Approximately 30% of seeded wells propagated and underwent ddPCR genotyping. Only cultures which demonstrated a homozygous L310S mutation PAM edit only mutation and homozygous NHEJ mutations were expanded up to a T-75 flask and cryopreserved.

Next generation sequencing libraries were generated according to published protocol33 and first and second round primers are detailed in Supplemental Table 2. Libraries were pooled together diluted to 4 nM and denatured in NaOH according to the Illumina Miseq protocol. Libraries were further diluted to 6.25 pM and spiked with 6 pM denatured PhiX at a ratio of 3:1. Samples were run with an Illumina Micro V2 kit with single read processing and generated over 300000 reads per sample. NGS sequencing identified a homozygous L310S mutant line a control homozygous PAM edit only line and a heterozygous NHEJ line with an allele with a 19 base pair deletion and a premature stop codon (S306_K307_delinsL*) and an allele with a three base-pair deletion D308_F309delinsV. The functional consequence of this mutation was assessed with PROVEAN analysis software22.

Cell lysate was isolated with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and quantified with a BCA assay. Protein lysate underwent electrophoresis (4–12% Bis–Tris NuPage gradient gel in MOPS buffer) and was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (NuPage Transfer buffer with 20% methanol). The blot was blocked in 5% Milk in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated in 5% Milk TBST containing mouse anti-DPYD (Sigma WH0001806M1) and rabbit anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling 4967S) primary antibodies. Blot was rinsed in TBST incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG cross-adsorbed DyLight 800 (ThermoFisher SA5-10172) and goat anti-rabbit IgG cross-adsorbed DyLight 680 secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher 35568) rinsed in TBST and imaged on a Li-Cor imager.

Mutant cell lines were thawed following genotyping with Illumina Miseq instrument and cultured for three passages. Cells were seeded in 10% FBS in RPMI. 24 h after seeding cell media was changed to serum free RPMI. For the seahorse assay after 24 h in serum free media cells were analyzed with the mitochondrial seahorse assay as described for PHHs. For imaging and mRNA analysis after 24 h in serum free media cells were treated with 25 µM FFAs. 24 h after treatment the 96 well plate was fixed stained with LipidTox and imaged on the Operetta as described previously. RNA was isolated reverse transcribed and mRNA levels quantified with Taqman primers via qPCR as described previously. Data was normalized to the geometric mean of three housekeeping genes (β-actin GAPDH and HPRT1). The delta-delta ct method was used to calculate fold change relative to the control PAM-edit only mutant line with or without free fatty acid exposure.

Statistical analysis

All data presented in figures represent mean + / − standard deviation. Imaging seahorse mitochondrial assay and quantitative PCR data were analyzed with a two-way analysis of variance with an alpha of 0.05 and Tukey’s post-hoc testing for multiple comparisons. For dose response curves a 3 parameter non-linear fit model was used (log(inhibitor) vs response) (Prism). The default Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) of the DESeq2 identified deferential expressed genes."

ADI,Analog Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3doeS1hbmFsb2ctZGV2aWNlcy1zdG9jay1mZWxsLWRlc3BpdGUtc3Ryb25nLWVhcm5pbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Analog Devices Stock Fell Despite Strong Earnings - TipRanks.com,"Analog Devices (ADI) delivered Fiscal Q3-2022 earnings results that both increased from the year-ago quarter and exceeded Wall Street expectations. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for Q4. Despite its strong earnings the stock price has fallen probably because of management’s comments about slowing orders.

Massachusetts-based Analog Devices is a semiconductor company that makes signal processing and power management chips. Its competitors include Texas Instruments (TXN).

Analog Devices’ Management Commentary Spooks Investors

Right after the earnings release Analog Devices stock fell almost 5% once investors heard that economic uncertainty was starting to affect orders for the company’s products.

“The macro backdrop is dynamic and it’s clear that we’re at an inflection point. Economic conditions are beginning to impact demand with orders showing — orders slowing later in the quarter and cancellations increasing slightly” cautioned Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche.

In a comment of hope though the executive said “While economic uncertainty is beginning to impact bookings demand continues to outpace supply resulting in higher backlog paving the way for a strong finish to a banner year.”

Earnings Snapshot

The Analog Devices earnings report is for the three months ended July 30. Revenue increased 77% from the year-ago quarter to $3.11 billion and surpassed the consensus estimate of $3.06 billion. Adjusted EPS jumped 47% from the year-ago quarter to $2.52 and beat the consensus estimate of $2.43.

The company returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Analog Devices has scheduled its next dividend distribution for September 8 to shareholders of record on August 30. The company is offering a dividend of $0.76 per share.

Analog Devices anticipates Q4 adjusted EPS of about $2.57 on revenue of about $3.15 billion. The internal projections are above Wall Street estimates for adjusted EPS of $2.50 on revenue of $3.09 billion.

Is Analog Devices a Good Stock?

Although ADI stock is down about 3% year-to-date it has fared better than many chip stocks. Wall Street experts remain bullish on the stock. According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus Analog Devices stock is a Moderate Buy based on seven Buys and three Holds. The average ADI stock forecast of $188.50 implies 11% upside potential.

Analog Devices is a favorite of elite investors. TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in ADI is currently Very Positive. Some 23 hedge funds increased their cumulative holdings of the stock by 2.5 million shares in the last quarter.

Final Thoughts

In addition to offering an above average dividend yield of 1.61% Analog Devices has also been paying increasing annual dividends over the past 13 years. While macroeconomic headwinds may be a concern Analog Devices’ business has bright long-term prospects considering the expanding application of its products.

But the good news is that you generally can.

Analog TV Broadcasting - A Quick Refresher

Analog TVs receive and display broadcast TV signals transmitted in a similar manner used for AM/FM radio transmissions. The video transmitted in AM while audio was in FM.

Analog TV transmissions were subject to interference such as ghosting and snow depending on the distance and geographical location of the TV receiving the signal. Analog broadcasts were also severely limited in terms of video resolution and color range.

Full power analog TV broadcasts officially ended on June 12 2009. There may be cases were low-power analog TV broadcasts could still be available in some communities. These should have also been discontinued as of September 1 2015 unless the FCC granted special permission to a specific station licensee.

With the transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting to continue receiving TV broadcasts consumers either have to purchase a new TV or implement a workaround to continue using an analog TV.workaround to continue using an analog TV.

The transition not only affected analog TVs but VCRs and pre-2009 DVD recorders that had built-in tuners designed to receive programming via an over-the-air antenna. Cable or satellite TV subscribers may or may not be affected (more on this below).

Ways to Connect an Analog TV in Today's Digital World

If you still have an analog TV and are currently not using it you can breathe new life into it with one of the following options:

If you receive TV programming via antenna external DTV converter boxes are available that enable using older TVs. Placing the DTV converter box between the antenna and the TV converts incoming DTV/HDTV signals to signals compatible with any analog TV. You won't get any of the increased resolutions of DTV or HDTV and all widescreen programming will show up as letterboxed (black bars on the to top and bottom of the image) on your analog set.

If you subscribe to a cable or satellite service and the box provides an analog RF output with supporting analog signal service you may be able to access programming. However if you have been receiving basic cable without a box using a ""cable-ready"" analog TV many services no longer provide analog TV signal output via this connection option. Even if your old analog TV is ""cable-ready"" you may now be required to rent a box from your provider that will covert digital cable signals back to analog. Contact your cable service or satellite provider for more details.

If the analog TV also includes in addition to an antenna/cable connection a set(s) of RCA style AV inputs (red white and yellow) you can connect an external DTV converter box or a cable/satellite box that has that connection option.

The DTV Transition also affects VCRs and DVD recorders (DVD recorders made before 2009) that may have a built-in tuner to receive programming via an over-the-air antenna as well as DVD recorders that do not include a built-in tuner. In these cases you must connect the VCR or DVD recorder to an external DTV converter box or cable/satellite box to receive TV programming for recording purposes.

You might be able to connect some media streamers to an analog TV that has a set of AV inputs provided the media streamer has a set of analog AV outputs. One example is the Roku Express Plus which allows access to streaming services such as Netflix Vudu and Hulu on your old analog TV.

An analog TV can only display images in standard definition resolution (480i). So even if the program source is originally in HD or 4K Ultra HD you will only see it as a standard resolution image.

Additional Note For Owners Of Pre-2007 HDTVs

Until 2007 HDTVs were not required to have digital or HD tuners. An old HDTV might only have an analog TV tuner. In that case the above connection options will also work. A standard definition signal will depend on the TV's upscaling capability to provide a better quality image for viewing.

Also an older HDTV may have DVI inputs instead of HDMI inputs for accessing HD resolution signals. If so you will have to use an HDMI-to-DVI converter cable as well as a second connection for Audio. You can use these connection options with compatible OTA HD-DVRs or HD cable/satellite boxes for receiving HDTV programming.

The Bottom Line

HDTVs and Ultra HD TVs provide a much better TV viewing experience but if you have an analog TV you may still be able to use it in the digital age. Although not desirable as a primary television (especially in a home theater setup) an analog TV could be suitable as a second or a third TV.

As years pass and the last analog TVs are finally disposed of (hopefully recycled) the analog-or-digital TV issue will be put to rest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLTA4LTE5L3RoZS1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLWlzbi10LW92ZXItcXVpdGUteWV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the Global Chip Shortage Over Yet?

Simulation software giant Ansys has been getting increasingly involved in AM from both a process/workflow angle and a simulation angle. This latter aspect which focuses on the ability to fine-tune a build process so that it is more repeatable and reliable has recently been explored via the use of artificial intelligence and Ansys machine learning technology including Ansys Granta MI.

A free downloadable White Paper from Ansys (described in an article by article by Scott Wilkins Lead Product Marketing Manager and Sak Arumugan Lead Product Manager) shows how taking a data-driven approach is key to making this happen. Being data-driven requires efficient access to the right data. Even where this is available real-world AM datasets are typically sparse and noisy placing constraints on their analysis. It can also be difficult to extract value from increasing volumes of data. Conversely in some areas too little data is available. Navigating these challenges to optimize AM materials and processes stretches the analytical capabilities of many teams.

Ansys machine learning offers a solution. It can use existing AM project data to build predictive models that identify key process-property relationships guide your testing program and propose optimal processing parameters. Ansys Granta MI manages AM project data a prerequisite for successful analysis. At the same time an integrated machine learning algorithm Alchemite from Intellegens can extract value from this data even when it is sparse noisy and in high volumes. The result is an out-of-the-box solution for data-driven AM. This new level of insight into AM data enables engineers to control the AM process and optimize material and part performance. They achieve results with a greatly reduced number of experimental test cycles. This accelerates time to market and can support end-to-end total cost savings for AM workflows of ~10%.

The challenges of AM

The key challenges for the large-scale adoption of AM in the industry are speed and reliability. Ansys’ research starts from the premise that overcoming these challenges is made even more difficult because every AM process has its own set of process parameters including material properties manufacturing settings and changing environmental conditions.

The choice of materials alone leads to a large number of variables. The powder chemistry of an alloy can vary widely because of small levels of impurities that can change the composition of every batch. For example Ansys the study asks what percentage of variance in the concentration of titanium in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy powder can be tolerated before an AM build fails. Or how do levels of impurities such as oxygen iron carbon and nitrogen affect the tensile strength of the resulting AM part?

Possible variations in processing parameters in a laser-powered AM machine (border power border speed hatch distance hatch speed hatch offset volumetric energy density etc.) add to the complexity of the AM challenge. Factoring in heat treatments non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection and mechanical testing variables leads to a major data management challenge. Being able to predict what will happen plays a large role in ensuring a high rate of build success when so many process-property combinations exist.

A data-driven approach to AM

Ansys Granta MI is the Ansys product for capturing material information. It enables companies to collect organize and store their own materials data gathered from testing of incoming raw materials and outgoing end products. This customized data is invaluable in fine-tuning the AM process for a company’s proprietary materials intellectual property.

Even with the data management capabilities of Granta MI real-world AM datasets are typically sparse and noisy. The term “sparse” is used to indicated that there are gaps in certain lines or columns of a dataset while “noisy” points to the fact that there can be a large spread between different measurements of the same property. Another problem is that even though there may be gaps in the data these material datasets can become too large to efficiently extract useful data.

In order to handle these massive quantities of data Ansys partnered with Intellegens to incorporate its Alchemite algorithm to statistically fill in the gaps and reduce the noise in the data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms often based on neural network approaches build models from sample data known as training data. Based only on what they have “learned” from this data without further explicit programming these models can predict missing values and outputs for a new set of input variables. Ansys machine learning can also be used in AM to optimize performance by predicting which inputs will best achieve desired outputs identify outliers anomalies or clusters in the data as well as which inputs are strong drivers of which outputs

Machine learning uses existing AM project data to build predictive models that identify key process-property relationships guide your testing program and propose optimal processing parameters. In short Alchemite can extract value from your data even when it is sparse noisy and in high volumes. When you have too little data ML helps you focus your data acquisition efforts efficiently by identifying key parameters that are missing. When you have too much data Alchemite can extract the key parameters that are critical to predicting AM build success.

Using machine learning in AM

This new level of insight into AM data enables engineers to control the AM process and optimize material and part performance. You can achieve results with a greatly reduced number of experimental test cycles which helps accelerate time to market and leads to substantial end-to-end total cost savings for AM programs.

To make the software easy to learn and use Granta MI for AM solutions has been distilled into three apps: a training dataset app an optimization app and a visualization app.

The training dataset app helps engineers create the training dataset for the neural network while the optimization app lets them take the model created by the neural network and interrogate it to get answers to your specific questions regarding AM processes. Finally the visualization app lets engineers quickly understand their data via graphic insights displays.

According to Ansys’ calculations AM processes that combine a data management system with ML are predicted to result in a 50-90% reduction in the number of experiments needed to establish the correct AM processing parameters. This and other benefits will lead to a 10% cost reduction in the global AM market. Learn more from the Ansys white paper “How Machine Learning Helps Getting Additive Manufactured Parts to Market Faster.”

For AM to continue growing as an industrial manufacturing process manufacturers will have to rely on improvements that reduce the number of build failures and give them confidence in their workflows. They can’t afford to keep wasting money on expensive metal powders that only end up on the scrap pile.

Ansys will continue to add features to Granta MI and work with Intellegens to make ML an even more important part of the AM build process ensuring that the benefits of additive manufacturing will be available to future generations of engineers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The researchers found that average costs per employee will reach $13800 in 2023. This is more than double the 3% increase that employers saw in 2022 but far below the current inflation index according to Aon.

On average employers budgeted $13020 per employee for the 2022 plan year. Much like the rest of the industry employers saw far lower medical claims costs during the COVID-19 pandemic with costs returning to more typical growth levels over the past year and inflation likely to play a role in driving up costs moving forward.

""In complete contrast over the last decades we are measuring that health care budgets for U.S. employers will come in nearly three times lower than the Consumer Price Index this calendar year"" said Debbie Ashford the North America chief actuary for health solutions at Aon in a release. ""Despite this historic occurrence employer health costs are expected to increase 6.5 percent in 2023 due to economic inflation pressures.""

The data come from the firm's Health Value Initiative database which includes 700 employers with 5.6 million employees in the U.S.

Ashford said that while price increases driven by inflation may not be felt immediately in healthcare due to the long-term nature of provider contacts they will likely become apparent in the coming year. Other factors driving cost increases include new technology blockbuster drugs specialty drugs and severe catastrophic claims.

One key solution for employers looking to address rising costs is to find ways to address chronic conditions the Aon analysts said. These include long-term illnesses as well as complex diseases and Ashford said it's not uncommon to see 1% of an employer's plan membership driving 40% of costs.

Plan sponsors should gather more data and use that information to predict where and when these excess costs may arise Ashford said.

""The effect of chronic conditions has far-reaching implications beyond what we see with health care costs out to the other areas of the business like absence and productivity disability and worker's compensation"" said Farheen Dam Aon's North America health solutions leader in a statement. ""By focusing on chronic conditions not only are we improving the health and happiness of employees but we're helping to improve the way they live and work.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xOC90aGlzLW5ldy0xMDBtLWZ1bmQtcGxhbnMtdG8tZm9jdXMtb24tc3RhcnR1cHMtYWNjZWxlcmF0aW5nLXRoZS1zY2llbmNlLWFyb3VuZC1sb25nZXZpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Life Extension Ventures to fund science around longevity,"Longevity-focused startups have been proliferating in recent years as we become more focused on our health. However it’s not just about apps to get you in the gym. Longevity startups can range from biotech-oriented disease prevention to organ regeneration. The Aging Analytics Agency estimates that global investments in longevity-focused startups hit more than $40 billion in 2021 and the market could grow to $600 billion by 2025 according to Bank of America.

Now investors like Apollo Health are raising large sums — such as their $180 million fund in November while Maximon Swiss longevity company builder raised a €96 million fund to name just two in Europe.

Now a new fund is coming out of the U.S. to join the fray.

New York-based Life Extension Ventures is a new $100 million fund saying it will focus on “longevity for people and planet”. In practice that will mean backing founders who are accelerating the science around longevity.

That includes areas such as people animals agriculture food energy and transportation as well as AI direct-to-consumer web3 infrastructure-as-a-service platforms and marketplaces.

Luckily the fund’s founders will know what they are talking about as the team has multiple science PhDs successful startups and angel investing under their belts.

Life Extension’s LPs include founders and investors from other VCs unicorn founders and large institutions.

The team includes Dr. Inaki Berenguer the co-founder of Life Extension who studied at MIT and Columbia before founding Pixable (acquired by Singtel) and CoverWallet (acquired by Aon in 2020).

Co-founder Dr. Amol Sarva studied cognitive science at Stanford and Columbia and taught entrepreneurship at Columbia. He is also gave WeWork a run for its money with flexible office unicorn Knotel and also started Peek (acquired by SoftBank).

The pair have previously made angel investments in startups such as Galatea Bio a DNA databank for genomic discovery; DeepCell the computer vision company that uses AI to create a database of cell morphology which has raised $100 million; and Particle Health which raised $40 million.

Over a call Sarva told me: “There was a clean tech 1.0 a clean tech 2.0 and something similar is happening in the biotech universe now. Software has now come to intersect with science in a new and different way and it makes the opportunity more like tech.”

Berenguer added: “We are going to focus on the software and data-driven companies in this category. Most of the entrepreneurs that we are going to back are not the typical biologist in a lab doing experiments. They are going to simulate experiments they are going to analyze that data. They’re going to for instance commercialize using API’s within marketplaces. So it’s very similar to what happened with the internet 20 years ago.”

Sarva went on: “The future of humanity depends certainly on what we do for people but also for the planet we live on. It’s the same. It’s the same technologies and science. That’s having an impact. It’s biology and chemistry. It’s having an impact on people on agriculture food even energy production. This cutting edge science is really the key to it all. And so we decided let’s go find where science and software intersect. That’s going to have a huge impact.”

International trail runner Erwee’s presence testified to the quality at the sharp end but the turnout of 50 teams featuring people of all abilities showcased the broader appeal of the relays.

There were also awards for top mixed and women’s team – which went to Hedosophia Two and Roadrunners respectively.

At the sharp end Island star James Priest gave his IQ-EQ mixed team an early lead with the day’s best leg of 4-02.

But it was ultimately a race of consistency and after Jake Robin handed off within the top six Ravenscroft took the front through Jake Le Marchant consolidating this through the efforts of Sam McKerrell and anchorman Brown.

They eventually won in 18-01 and Brown said that felt ‘brilliant’.

‘We all set the scene together’ he said.

‘I’ve been doing all the training and I was like “Right let’s rope in a team”.

‘Ravenscroft usually do try and do one every year and we had a couple of teams this year but we had some guys who are half-decent runners and it all came together which is very good.’

He was similarly enthusiastic in his feedback for the event praising the ‘completely different mix of people’ who take part among other things.

‘It’s nice to do something different and there’s so much support – we had a load of guys waiting down at Balthazar so we had all the cheering there. You get loads of people who wait and cheer.

‘Actually it’s quite good fun to run through Town as you spend so much time walking through it so yeah it’s a good chance to have a crack at that.’

Mike Batiste of Guernsey Press: Print Runners (Hacks) also posted a notably fast leg at 4-05 as HSBC PMT’s Sam Hall ran 4-17 for third individual.

Roadrunners’ Susie Armstrong 4-50 topped the women’s standings with both her teammate Savannah Goddard and Distance Matters’ Liz Dudin sharing the same time of 5-08."

According to the tech company a kernel vulnerability — CVE-2022-32894 — and a WebKit vulnerability — CVE-2022-32893 — are present on various devices including iPhones (6s or later) all iPad Pros iPad Airs (2 or later) iPads (5 or later) iPad minis (4 or later) seventh generation iPod touches and Mac computers running macOS Big Sur Catalina or Monterey.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities open devices up to threats

Apple has pushed updates patching the vulnerabilities out to users of iPhone iPad and Mac devices. Anonymous security researchers uncovered the vulnerabilities and the tech company stated that they are ""aware of a report that [these issues] may have been actively exploited.""

The kernel vulnerability (CVE-2022-32894) may allow applications to ""execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges"" while the WebKit vulnerability (CVE-2022-32893) may allow arbitrary code execution if malicious web content is processed via Safari according to the company's disclosure statements.

The vulnerabilities may be related to one another according to TechCrunch.

Mobile device security remains a critical enterprise security strategy

The vulnerabilities have the potential to expose enterprise networks via mobile devices says Richard Melick Director of Threat Reporting at Zimperium.

""Mobile is a critical part of the enterprise workforce but remains a largely unaddressed attack surface ripe for exploitation and compromise"" said Melick. ""These latest exploits and vulnerabilities revealed by Apple are just a few of the mobile-specific attacks we have seen this year. Last year the data showed a 466% increase in mobile-specific zero-day vulnerabilities accounting for one in three of all reported zero-day attacks. So far this year we have seen roughly the same volume of zero-day attacks against mobile with seven of the 23 in the wild attacks being mobile specific. All it takes is one mobile device to fall victim to an exploit as part of a larger attack chain leaving enterprise data integrity compromised.""

Mobile device security is also a critical part of executive protection. With these high-profile cybersecurity vulnerabilities affecting Apple devices enterprise security leaders should assess their business leaders' cyber risk. Rajiv Pimplaskar CEO of Dispersive Holdings Inc. highlighted the cybersecurity risks threatening executive devices. ""According to BlackCloak research 87% of executive devices have no security measures at all installed and 76% are actively leaking data. The Apple security vulnerabilities taken in this context are a stark reminder of the dangers of an expanded attack surface with the proliferation of mobile endpoints"" he said.

Affected organizations and users can install the updates released by Apple to protect their devices from exploits of the disclosed vulnerabilities. According to Corey Sinclair Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Horizon3ai ""We often find that malicious threat actors do not take advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities. Rather successful cyber threat actors target companies and organizations that run outdated software and operating systems by using years-old vulnerabilities and weaknesses that vendors have already issued patches and/or published fix-or mitigation actions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xOC9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTQtbGF1bmNoLWRhdGUtdGFyZ2V0LTctc2VwdGVtYmVyLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple iPhone 14 gets prospective launch date of 7 September 2022,"Apple Inc. is aiming to hold a launch event on Sept. 7 to unveil the iPhone 14 line according to people with knowledge of the matter rolling out the latest version of a product that generates more than half its sales.

The new iPhones will kick off a busy fall product season which will also include multiple new Macs low-end and high-end iPads and three Apple Watch models.

Apple is updating its flagship product at a precarious time for the industry. Smartphone sales have begun to flag as consumers cope with inflation and a shaky economy. But Apple appears to be faring better than its peers: The iPhone sold well last quarter and the company has signaled to suppliers that it doesn’t foresee a dropoff in demand.

The Cupertino California-based tech giant typically announces other products alongside the iPhone including the latest Apple Watches. The company usually releases the new iPhone in stores about a week and a half after it’s unveiled and Apple is expected to stick to that pattern this year. Some retail store employees have been told to prepare for a major new product release on Sept. 16.

Apple gained almost 1% to $174.54 in New York trading. The stock remains down 2% this year though it’s climbed back from a much deeper rout in recent months.

The company intends to stream the event online — rather than holding an in-person gathering — continuing an approach it adopted at the start of the pandemic. Apple launches are highly polished affairs and employees have already begun recording the presentation’s segments over the past few weeks Bloomberg News has reported.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the event’s timing. Given that the announcement is still about three weeks away the company’s plans could change but Apple usually unveils the latest iPhones in the first half of September.

The company held its last event in June to announce its next set of software updates — iOS 16 iPadOS 16 watchOS 9 and macOS Ventura — and invited press and developers to its campus to watch a video of the presentation. That arrangement was part of Apple’s slow shift back to more normal operations a push that has included a return to the office.

On Monday the company told its corporate staff they would be required to work in-person three days a week beginning Sept. 5 two days before the planned product announcement.

The standard iPhone 14 will look similar to the iPhone 13 though the company will eliminate the 5.4-inch “mini” version and add a model with a 6.7-inch screen. This will mark the first time Apple launches a non-Pro iPhone with a display of that size.

The company is planning bigger changes for the iPhone 14 Pro line. Apple will replace the front-facing camera cutout known as the notch with a pill-shaped hole for Face ID sensors and a hole-punch-sized area for the camera. This will give users slightly more screen space. The company is also adding a faster chip to the iPhone 14 Pro. Apple meanwhile will retain the A15 chip from the iPhone 13 in the regular iPhone 14 models.

The most significant iPhone 14 Pro changes will be to the camera system which will appear slightly larger to consumers. The Pro models will gain a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera alongside 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto sensors. Apple is also planning improvements to video recording and battery life.

For the latest Apple Watches known as Series 8 Apple will add features for women’s health and a body-temperature sensor. The standard watch will look similar to the Series 7 but a new pro model will go after sportier consumers. It will have a larger display rugged titanium case new fitness tracking features and more battery life. The company also is planning a new Apple Watch SE its low-cost smartwatch with a faster chip.

Also coming in September: iOS 16 the software that will run on the next iPhones and watchOS 9 the next Apple Watch operating system. And the company plans to launch macOS Ventura in October alongside iPadOS the iPad’s operating system. The latter software was delayed about a month in part due to bugs surrounding its new Stage Manager multitasking system.

Apple is working on an updated low-end iPad with an A14 chip and USB-C port as well as new iPad Pro models with M2 chips for later this year Bloomberg News has reported. It’s also looking to launch new Macs before the end of the year as it works on versions of the Mac mini and MacBook Pro with M2-based processors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA1L2Fib3J0aW9uLXRyYXZlbC1iZW5lZml0LXViZXItYXBwbGUtYW1hem9uLWx5ZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abortion cost benefits: Amazon Apple more help employees with travel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/05/05/abortion-travel-benefit-uber-apple-amazon-lyft on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA1L2Fib3J0aW9uLXRyYXZlbC1iZW5lZml0LXViZXItYXBwbGUtYW1hem9uLWx5ZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTYyNjAyOTA50gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNjI2MDI5MDkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hackers may have exploited security flaws - Apple,

The net result will be more process steps increased complexity for each of those steps and rising costs across the board.

At the leading-edge finFETs will run out of steam somewhere after the 3nm (30 angstrom) node. The three foundries still working at those nodes — TSMC Samsung and Intel as well as industry research house imec — are looking to some form of gate-all-around transistors as the next transistor structure in order to gain tighter control over gate leakage.

This approach is likely to work for at least a couple more nodes after that and possibly further with the rollout of forksheet FETs an intermediary step developed by imec. (See figure 1) Yet each of these companies is using different naming conventions timelines and technology mixes making it difficult to determine which has technology leadership at any particular moment.

“If you look back we started with bipolar devices and then we moved to planar CMOS and to 3D finFETs” said Kevin Zhang senior vice president of business development at TSMC. “Now we’re moving to nanosheet gate-all-around transistors. But the transistor structure is going to evolve. It’s not going to be every generation or node where you have to bring in a new architecture because new transistors or architectures take a long long time. We have been investing in nanosheet technology for over 10 years in order to have enough confidence to introduce it at the 2nm node.”

Foundries will extend existing technologies as long as possible because each change is costly. In addition to new manufacturing processes developed by the foundry it requires fine-tuning hundreds of process steps involving manufacturing equipment. The key metrics here are time spent in manufacturing for each wafer which contributes to cost and time to adequate yield. Each step requires changes in everything from EDA tools which need to be certified at each node and half-node for each foundry to exactly when various equipment is inserted into the manufacturing flow. There can be multiple insertion points for complex chips. That makes actual timelines hard to pin down and foundries may not push to the next technology node until they run out of improvements using existing technology.

TSMC the current process leader — and the only pure-play foundry at the leading edge — plans to migrate to GAA FETs at 2nm. Yuh-jier Mii senior vice president of R&D at TSMC said in a recent presentation that finFETs at 3nm will offer 18% speed improvement using the same power or 34% power reduction at the same performance. With nanosheets there will be about a 10% to 15% speed improvement a 25% to 30% power reduction and 1.1X density increase. He also noted that existing design rules will be compatible at N2 which will allow reuse of IP.

Intel will follow a similar path using its version of a GAA FET called a RibbonFET. Intel likewise has said it has enough improvements left in its finFET technology to extend finFETs for one more node.

“We are offering an advanced finFET at the current production node” said Rahul Goyal vice president and general manager of product and design ecosystem enablement at Intel. “We also are looking at the next-generation node which will be coming out in the next year or so. And then our sweet spot — which is the most advanced node and where we believe we can have differentiation — is in development with several customers. This gets us into the 2024 to 2025 time frame and a better understanding of what our customers need and how to make it happen. The challenge is making sure we are working with our customers in the early phase to accelerate our learning as much as possible and then also to enable our ecosystem and partners to serve our customers. The ecosystem is very powerful and has become extremely vibrant over the years. There’s a lot of R&D in that ecosystem.”

Samsung meanwhile will introduce GAA technology at 3nm which it calls Multi-Bridge Channel FETs. The company claims this technology can reduce power consumption by 45% improve performance by 23% and reduce area by 16% versus a 5nm finFET. The following generation will reduce power consumption by up to 50% and improve performance by 30% using 35% less area. One of the key improvements Samsung is touting is adjustable channel widths which can reduce the power needed to drive signals.

What’s next?

After GAA FETs the next rev of technology likely will include stacked GAA FETs also known as complementary FETs (CFETs) for up to 50% scaling. This change extends nanosheets a couple more nodes at least. How many layers can be stacked up may determine the extensibility of this technology.

“We’re looking at lateral nanowires nanosheets and some degree of stacking of lateral nanowires and nanosheets for the next few technology generations” said David Fried vice president of computational products at Lam Research. “Everybody likes to survey the full list of advanced devices and look at vertical and lateral devices and stacks but the investment required to make any of these changes is so significant that manufacturers had better be certain that they are going to get at least a few nodes out of a major transition before they make that transition. You try not to make these decisions one node at a time.”

CFETs are expected to start showing up somewhere around 14 angstroms (1.4nm) or whatever the actual number is — at this point it has not been determined. CFETs have been on the drawing board for more than a decade and are considered an evolutionary step from nanosheet and forksheet FETs. With CFETs nFET and pFET wires are stacked in one- or two-wire configurations providing an area and density benefit while still limiting current leakage at the gate. That leakage is why a battery drains or electricity continues to flow even when a device is turned off.

Rethinking some basics

Unlike in the past when a process could be ironed out over billions of units of the same design end users are demanding more customized solutions for a particular application. In some cases these are being designed for internal consumption such as a hyperscale data center. That limits the amount of industry learning to a specific design which is further reduced by smaller volumes.

To make matters worse some of these devices are being used in safety- and mission-critical applications. So in addition to being produced in limited numbers there is demand for increased reliability over longer lifetime.

In response a number of interesting strategies are under development to deal with these and related issues. For example rather than expecting every transistor or interconnect in a design to work perfectly — at 100% yield — the idea is to be able to identify which ones are bad or go bad at any point in a chip’s lifetime. The emphasis here is on resilience. In the past this was accomplished with redundancy and the general attitude was that transistors are free. But that approach is too expensive in a heterogeneous design where some of the compute elements and memories are created by the different vendors.

“There are two issues” said Andrzej Strojwas CTO of PDF Solutions. “First how do you determine very early that a circuit is not going to work? And second how do you build a reconfigurable interconnect? You can use active circuitry to reconfigure that interconnect. The standard way of doing this is you do the testing after the fabrication process is over and you burn the fuses. But if you have the information inline via eBeam scanning at the low-level metal levels you can do this much more efficiently. The granularity is different.”

When Sony introduced the Playstation 2 in 2000 based on IBM’s Cell processor it was designed with six cores even though only five were needed. The approach was considered revolutionary at the time. But reconfigurability adds a whole new level of understanding about what’s happening from design through manufacturing including real-time analytics the ability to reroute signals as needed and to partition designs with much more precision.

Lithography is about to undergo a significant and costly shift as well. EUV deployed for high-volume manufacturing at 5nm after about a decade of delays already is falling behind. At 3nm and 2nm multi-patterning again will be needed unless ASML — the only source for leading-edge lithography equipment — can roll out high-numerical aperture EUV (high-NA EUV) and at a price point that makes sense. High-NA EUV has an aperture of 0.55 versus 0.33 for EUV and it uses an anamorphic lens to be able to correctly print features at the edges of a wafer. But not all metal layers will require high-NA EUV which means it likely will be integrated into the manufacturing flow as a point tool rather than one-size-fits-all.

Another strategy that is gaining traction is design technology co-optimization which links front-end design with manufacturing much more closely than in the past. DTCO has been around for years but it has only gained use at the most advanced nodes.

“In the planar CMOS era designers and technologists could predict how a node would scale” said Ricardo Borges product marketing director in Synopsys’ Custom Design and Manufacturing Group. “That kind of intuition became less credible with the introduction of finFETs which introduced some new things into the mix and made predicting the characteristics of the node more difficult. Today there is more variety and a greater number of architectures that need to be explored. For example in the near-term we are seeing early releases of gate-all-around technologies. Beyond those there are other types of GAA architectures and more materials that need to be evaluated. At some point there could be a replacement for silicon with other materials. We’re already seeing novel metals like ruthenium and molybdenum being considered as alternatives to copper because they offer lower resistivity. And then there are certain constructs which imec calls scaling boosters that might be a new process technique to reduce the variability of a patterning approach.”

Yet another approach is simply not to scale to the most advanced nodes at all. Foundries such as UMC and GlobalFoundries are investing heavily at mature nodes where alternative approaches are being used to boost PPA. Gregg Bartlett senior vice president of technology engineering and quality at GlobalFoundries said 80% of the chips in use today are manufactured at mature nodes and he expects that number to increase with growth in advanced packaging hybrid bonding chiplets and more domain-specific designs.

That doesn’t make designs at mature nodes any less complex though. “We start with materials and then design the chip rather than starting with the end market and figuring out what they want to do with the design and what materials map into it” Bartlett said. “SOITEC has 27 different kinds of SOI (silicon on insulator) materials with different thicknesses of the box different thicknesses of silicon and different crystal orientations. Understanding why one substrate is better than another is a really important consideration. And it’s not because of the material properties. It’s because by the time it’s integrated all the way into performance at the system level you understand how this translates.”

Different options

What’s surprising is just how much R&D is happening at all process nodes not just at the leading edge and that research is likely to explode with the passage of the CHIPS And Science Act in the United States and the European Chips Act which will funnel collectively more than $100 billion in to research of a variety of related fields.

This includes silicon photonics for multi-chip and multi-module/package communication which has been used extensively inside of data centers to connect servers to storage. Increasingly it will be used over shorter and shorter distances. Light is very fast takes minimal energy to actually transmit signals and it generates very little heat. But it also requires monitoring for thermal fluctuations which can push signals outside the range of filters and inspection for any roughness in waveguides which affects signals. Unlike electrons photons don’t like corners which is one of the challenges in building photonics into chips.

“For us we want to be able to simulate two devices bottled together in some shape or fashion and to be able to emulate and simulate a combination of both of those” said Bartlett. “The EDA guys are doing a good job of keeping up in the background. We just had an announcement with one of the EDA suppliers on our 45CLO platform (C L and O are different wavelength bands each with different loss) because now you’re trying to do electro-optics. Those are areas that are at the forefront of the industry and we’re trying to enable our customers with the right design tools.”

Specialty foundry offerings are booming as well. “Strong wafer demand kept our fabs operating at full capacity and higher-than average blended pricing with our overall revenue” said UMC President Jason Wang during a recent earnings call. “SoC technologies such as non-volatile memory power management RF-SOI and OLED display drivers are necessary applications across 5G AIoT and automotive. And our strategy to focus on specialty technologies has been successful — it now contributes more than half of our wafer revenue.”

Wang noted that the continued electrification of automobiles is a catalyst for future growth as well.

Other options

Perhaps the biggest shift of all comes in the way of packaging options and chiplets. There are many ways to put different pieces together including a mix of digital logic developed at the most advanced nodes with other logic analog and various types of memories developed at mature nodes. In fact as designs become increasingly heterogeneous and customized for specific applications and use cases there is a growing need to add even greater flexibility into them.

“One customer we talked to had a very complex interrupt controller” said Andy Jaros vice president sales marketing and solutions architecture at Flex Logix. “They needed to anticipate all the different permutations their customers would want to boot up their chip including which peripherals to connect or make available to the external world and they were trying to do that under software control. What they found is that no matter how they configured it or how complex that interrupt controller was that interrupt controller wouldn’t be supported. That’s where the embedded FPGA comes into play. You can have a much simpler interrupt controller and that interrupt controller is targeted and specifically designed for each customer. So now you don’t have to anticipate every potential boot case or boot sequence or combinatorial variation. Basically when the customer needs it you generate some new RTL and drop it in for that customer’s sequencing requirements.”

Mixing and matching various components and processes produces some unexpected results as well. Consider hybrid bonding which provides a much more direct way of connecting different components than soldering them together.

“Because of solder’s slow temperature processes it restricts a lot of the downstream applications they want to do” said Kim Yess executive director of the Wafer Level Processing Business Division at Brewer Science. “We’re also seeing where customers were doing solder ball integration that they’re having so much deformation or fracturing that they’re now considering hybrid bonding. It’s going to be quicker than true heterogeneous integration.”

Copper-to-copper hybrid bonding is the farthest along but there is work underway to use dielectrics for the bond. “We’re working in parallel with a polymeric dielectric to do the same thing” said Dongshun Bai a scientist at Brewer Science. “It’s still in the early development stage.”

Another advantage of hybrid bonding is that it reduces the stress points in bonding which can cause cracks in the solder balls particularly at the corners. “We’ve heard about major challenges such as lateral alignment” said Bai. “If the alignment is less than 2 microns they may have some issues. And if the microbump connection becomes smaller stability will be a concern.”

The future

Unlike in the past when the whole chip industry was marching in lock step to the next process node there are many possible avenues under consideration. There is work at existing nodes to more accurately print features on wafers using curvilinear mask shapes. “Today if you want to draw a certain shape on the wafer reliably we manipulate the shapes on the photomask pretty aggressively” said Aki Fujimura CEO of D2S. “Often the shape on the mask ends up looking nothing like the intended shape on the wafer.”

This is where curvilinear masks fit in. “It’s getting harder and harder every technology node even with EUV to get the wafer shapes to be as uniform as possible across manufacturing variation” Fujimura said. “It’s been well established for about two decades that the best uniformity is achieved by using curvilinear shapes on mask. This is where multi-beam mask writers come in. Now that the majority of the leading edge masks are written with multibeam mask writers curvilinear shapes are possible to manufacture. In the prior generation with variable-shaped beam (VSB) technology curvilinear mask shapes were impractical to write.”

And if that’s not sufficient there are development efforts underway involving 2D materials for carbon nanotube FETs which are on the radar of all the leading foundries. Whether those structures actually will materialize for mainstream applications for specialty chips or at all remains to be seen. While research into different transistor structures using exotic materials continues leading foundries are looking toward architectures and advanced packaging as possible paths forward either with or without the help of OSATs.

What appears certain is that competition is heating up rather than subsiding and the race is on to “mass customize” semiconductors quickly at the lowest cost possible and with maximum reliability. The question now is which is the best path forward and that remains to be proven.

A robust nanofiltration membrane that acts as a highly effective molecular sieve can avoid many of the problems with current polymer membranes.

Filtration plays a crucial role in many industries ranging from water purification to pharmaceutical production. Organic solvent nanofiltration for example uses membranes with tiny pores to remove molecules that are dissolved in organic (carbon-based) solvents.

Nanofiltration is more energy efficient than alternative separation methods such as distillation. But to withstand the rigors of industrial use nanofiltration membranes must be stable against harsh solvents acids and bases.

""Unfortunately the majority of polymer-based membranes exhibit poor chemical stability"" says postdoc Rifan Hardian. These membranes typically need additional chemical crosslinkers to improve their stability which complicates their manufacture. Many membranes as they swell and age also tend to lose their performance and they may even break down to release trace contaminants.

Hardian and his KAUST colleagues Mahmoud A. Abdulhamid and Gyorgy Szekely have now overcome these drawbacks by creating a new kind of carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membrane that does not require additional crosslinkers.

The membrane is based on a polymer called 6FDA-DMN which can be formed into a flat porous membrane with good thermal stability. Baking the polymer membrane at 400–600 degrees Celsius for several hours gradually burned off some of its chemical groups to leave a tough membrane made entirely of carbon. Electron microscope images showed that at the highest temperatures this carbonization process also shrank the membrane's pores considerably.

After fine-tuning the conditions used to make the CMS membrane the researchers tested its filtration abilities using solutions containing molecules with a range of sizes. The profile of molecules retained by the membrane compared with those that passed through its pores revealed how effective the membrane was at sieving different molecules.

The membranes prepared at 600 degrees Celsius performed best holding back most of the smallest molecules while allowing solvent molecules to flow through. The team also found that the porous structure of the initial polymer was key to producing a CMS membrane with high solvent permeance.

""A combination of high rejection of small molecules and high solvent permeance indicate a better membrane performance"" Hardian explains. ""The membranes also exhibited exceptional stability in various organic solvents including acid and base for a long period.""

The researchers are now working to improve the membrane's permeance and plan to incorporate various nanomaterials into the membrane to control its properties.

The research was published in Applied Materials Today.

Because of their remarkable photophysical characteristics and mechanical stability silver nanowires (AgNWs) are commonly used for making flexible transparent electrodes.

However the excessive surface roughness and low durability of AgNWs-based flexible transparent electrodes significantly restrict their practical uses. A recent study published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces addresses this problem by integrating AgNWs with the eco-friendly and cytoprotective biomaterial propolis to create highly stable flexible transparent electrodes.

AgNWs-based Transparent Electrodes: Overview and Challenges

Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) are a critical element of wearable electronics like thin-film photovoltaic panels organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) supercapacitors and detectors. Conventional indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes have intrinsic fragility unavailability and a problematic manufacturing procedure.

As a result numerous novel flexible transparent electrodes such as thin metal sheets metal nanorods and conductive polymers have been created as viable replacements for conventional indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes.

Because of their high transparency minimal sheet resistivity and remarkable mechanical adaptability silver nanowires (AgNWs) stand out among these novel FTEs. Transparent electrodes based on AgNWs have been used in semiconductor applications adaptable supercapacitors solar cells detectors and air purifiers.

However AgNWs-based flexible transparent electrodes have several intrinsic flaws. Because of the significant surface roughness of AgNWs short-circuiting occurs across OLEDs and photovoltaic panels. Furthermore the stability issues of AgNWs limit their industrial-scale applicability in wearable electronics.

Limitations of Currently Used Methods

To date techniques such as contact transference and coating adapted layers have been explored to alleviate the problems associated with AgNWs-based transparent electrodes. Coating techniques as opposed to the difficult transfer procedure offer the benefit of one-step production and have been widely utilized to embellish AgNWs electrodes.

However there have been few reports of AgNWs-based transparent electrodes achieving low surface irregularity and good stability without losing photophysical characteristics.

2D materials like graphene oxide as well as metal oxides such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have been proposed to decorate AgNWs to improve the durability of transparent electrodes. Nonetheless these nanomaterials often cause AgNWs-based transparent electrodes to lose opacity.

Conductive polymers have also been employed as modifying materials in AgNWs-based transparent electrodes because of their electrical properties. However these polymers deteriorate at high temperatures and their intrinsic acidity ultimately triggers the chemical erosion of AgNWs networks.

Development of Biocompatible AgNWs-based Transparent Electrodes

Metal films such as gold and platinum can be employed to create homogenous and durable transparent electrodes by electrolytic or physical vapor deposition techniques. Aside from electrode characteristics a renewable manufacturing technique is critical for decreasing pollution generated by complicated fabrication procedures.

In this context a biodegradable chitosan compound for altering AgNWs electrodes was recently reported. Although the smooth surfaces of the AgNWs/chitosan electrodes were remarkable chitosan must be dissolved in an acidic solution before the fabrication process. Furthermore chitosan disintegrates at high temperatures and changes color.

As a result highly durable AgNWs-based transparent electrodes with outstanding optoelectrical capabilities and long-term durability using sustainable biodegradable materials are still urgently needed for large-scale industrial applications.

Highlights and Key Developments of the Study

In this study the researchers report extremely stable AgNWs-based hybrid adaptable transparent electrodes containing biomaterial propolis. Propolis is a bee-collected compound with biodegradable cytoprotective and antibacterial characteristics. It may be obtained straight from the environment and needs little preparation.

The flat surface and high durability of the hybrid transparent electrodes were made possible by the biomaterial propolis's outstanding film-forming capability and thermal properties. The transparent electrodes demonstrated enhanced optoelectrical efficiency minimal sheet resistance good optical clarity and a flat texture.

More notably the transparent electrodes demonstrated good physical durability and environmental adaptation testing stability. After 10000 bending cycles and exposure to 60 °C and 85% moisture the hybrid transparent electrodes kept their sheet resistance and surface shape.

Modular white OLEDs and pressure detectors were also created to demonstrate the capabilities of the as-developed transparent electrodes. White OLEDs outperformed rigid devices in terms of current efficiency and mechanical endurance. The resulting pressure sensors were also environmentally stable and customizable.

Based on these results it is reasonable to conclude that the transparent electrodes created in this work may be utilized to create environmentally benign and extremely stable adaptable electronics.

Combining ADM’s manufacturing capabilities with New Culture’s innovations in animal-free casein and animal-free cheese the partnership will focus on joint product development and expansion into the foodservice market.

“After tasting New Culture’s delicious animal-free mozzarella we recognized that the company had the potential to play a central role in bringing great-tasting break-through products to the dairy aisle” said Ian Pinner senior vice president of strategy and innovation for ADM.

Developed with precision fermentation techniques New Culture differentiates itself from many similar animal-free products by creating its animal-free mozzarella using traditional methods of cheesemaking and food science instead of relying on ingredients like soy and nuts. The company’s cheeses are formulated with animal-free casein water plant-based fat sugar vitamins and minerals according to the company.

As part of the collaboration ADM is planning to bring New Culture’s mozzarella to pizzerias starting in 2023. ADM also will provide resources to help New Culture expand the use of its animal-free casein into a wider product array.

“This partnership between New Culture and ADM gives our team the chance to accelerate our path to commercialization and expand what’s possible for our product portfolio” said Matt Gibson president and chief executive officer for New Culture.

A part of theInflation Reduction Act signed into law by President Joe Biden this week will increase the tax credits for companies that choose to pipe their carbon underground. It raises the government subsidies for each metric ton of carbon stored underground from 50 dollars to 85 dollars – incentivizing ethanol plants to participate in carbon capture technology.

This will profit the companies –Summit Carbon Solutions Navigator CO2 Ventures and Archer Daniels Midland – that are attempting to build pipelines that will capture carbon emissions liquify them and transport them to be stored underground in nearby states.

Vice president of public affairs Elizabeth Burns-Thompson at Navigator CO2 said the legislation could help pique the interest of more industries beyond ethanol to engage with their project.

“This new legislation potentially brings additional manufacturers to the table to look at how they can incorporate into the platform as well” Burns-Thompson said.

Navigator CO2 Ventures Navigator CO2's pipeline would span 1200 miles across the state.

Summit Carbon Solutions said in a statement that the move exemplifies carbon capture and sequestration pipelines' role in achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions.

Combined the projects are expected to be able to capture up to 39 million metric tons of carbon annually equating to around $3.3 billion in potential subsidies a year.

A game-changer

The legislation will be a game-changer in expanding the financial viability of carbon capture projects as a whole. John Thompson technology and markets director of the Clean Air Task Force an international non-profit devoted to decarbonization said it will make carbon capture an option for industries that once found it too costly.

“What the Inflation Reduction Act does is it makes carbon capture feasible on hundreds of plants around the nation. A lot of those are going to be ethanol plants” Thompson said. “But increasingly more and more of them will be in what we call hard to decarbonize or hard to abate sectors: steel cement power refineries petrochemicals pulp and paper.”

""It makes carbon capture feasible on hundreds of plants around the nation."" John Thompson technology and markets director of the Clean Air Task Force

Thompson said the legislation is a victory for climate change. He supports the construction of the carbon capture pipelines in Iowa – estimating the companies’ combined efforts would reduce Iowa's industrial emissions by around 40 percent.

He said the projects could nearly double the amount of carbon being captured nationally.

“That's why these projects are nationally significant and why they're so important in the fight against global warming” he said.

Iowa environmentalists push back

But not all think the legislation is worthy of celebration. State environmental organizations see the increased tax incentives as a step back in addressing the nation’s climate crisis. They argue it’s using public money to increase the profits of polluting industries.

“That's just more taxpayer dollars that are going to these private companies that are going to make billions of dollars in private profits” said Jess Mazour conservation program coordinator forIowa’s Sierra Club chapter. “We know there are better ways to spend our taxpayer dollars on projects like wind and solar that are proven to work and do much less damage than carbon pipelines.”

Clay Masters / Iowa Public Radio More than 100 farmers gathered in the rotunda of the Iowa Capitol in Des Moines last March to protest three proposed carbon pipelines in the state.

Environmentalists across the state have been outspoken in their criticism of carbon capture pipelines. They decry the technology as a false climate solution and fear it could be used in enhanced oil recovery – a process that involves pumping carbon underground in order to extract more oil from it.

""That's just more taxpayer dollars that are going to these private companies that are going to make billions of dollars in private profits."" Jess Mazour Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club

Under the IRA enhanced oil recovery efforts are also getting an incentive boost. Companies can earn up to $60 up from $35 on each carbon metric ton that is used for oil recovery or other manufacturing processes.

Environmental lawyer Carolyn Raffensperger said this legislation only empowers the fossil fuel industry.

“It is a bad economic deal for farmers landowners and it is certainly a bad economic deal for the public” said Raffensperger of the Science and Environmental Health Network.

Organizer Emma Schmit of the IowaFood and Water Watch said the legislation has strengthened the resolve of the pipeline’s opposition – which has united landowners and environmentalists alike.

“I have not met an Iowan that's invested in this fight that isn't just absolutely miffed over this deal” Schmit said. “They feel like they're being ignored by their leaders and elected officials while these companies are kind of being handed the golden goose.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9jb21tb2RpdHkta2luZ3MtY2FyZ2lsbC1idW5nZS1idXlpbmctc295LWZyb20tc3RvbGVuLWluZGlnZW5vdXMtbGFuZC1yZXBvcnQtc2F5cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Commodity kings Cargill Bunge buying soy from stolen Indigenous land report says,"Commodity-trading giants Cargill and Bunge source some of the soy used in products like chicken feed and pet food to land where Indigenous communities have suffered violence and displacement according to a new report from Earthsight an organization investigating environmental and social injustices.

The companies have ties to a 9700-hectare (24000-acre) soy farm in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul that operates on the ancestral land of the Guarani Kaiowá an Indigenous group that has spent the last several decades fighting forced eviction.

Earthsight has documented supply chain links between soy from the Brasília do Sul farm and chicken retailers like KFC Sainsbury’s Asda Aldi and Iceland as well as German supermarket chains like Rewe Markt Netto Marken-Discount Lidl Aldi and Edeka.

Earthsight said Cargill and Bunge need to take a firmer stance on Indigenous rights rather than passing off responsibility to intermediaries or deferring to legal loopholes.

Two of the world’s largest agricultural producers are caught up in another scandal involving soy grown on illegally seized Indigenous land in Brazil.

Both Cargill and Bunge source some of their soy products used in products like chicken feed and pet food from land where Indigenous communities have suffered violence and displacement according to a new report from Earthsight an organization investigating environmental and social injustices.

“Flaws in Cargill’s stance on Indigenous rights and Bunge’s traceability of indirect suppliers expose the two multibillion-dollar US firms’ supply chains to illegalities and violent conflict despite their stated human rights commitments” Earthsight’s report said.

Cargill and Bunge both have ties to a 9700-hectare (24000-acre) soy farm in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul that operates on the ancestral land of the Guarani Kaiowá an Indigenous group that has spent the last several decades fighting forced eviction the report said.

The farm called Brasília do Sul sends soy directly to Cargill’s facility in Caarapó about 30 kilometers (18 miles) away according to the report. The soy also makes it to a Bunge processing unit in the nearby municipality of Dourados via indirect suppliers.

Earthsight has documented supply chain links between Brasília do Sul soy and chicken retailers like KFC Sainsbury’s Asda Aldi and Iceland. It’s also connected the farm to pet food sold by large German supermarkets like Rewe Markt Netto Marken-Discount Lidl Aldi and Edeka.

In 2003 Kaiowá leader Marcos Veron was killed by Brasília do Sul employees and hired gunmen after trying to reclaim his people’s land the report said. Brasília do Sul has also gone to court to prevent the Kaiowá from taking back the land through legal channels.

“It’s very unfortunate that these companies continue to do this” Adriana Ramos policy and law adviser at Instituto Socioambiental a nonprofit that advocates for the rights of Indigenous and traditional peoples told Mongabay. “They stay in this position as if they don’t have any responsibility.”

Earthsight’s report is a follow-up to a May investigation documenting the violence occurring at Brasília do Sul. Recent visits to the area helped identify which commodity traders — Bunge and Cargill — were purchasing the soy.

The two companies together with Archer Daniels Midland and Louis Dreyfus make up the four largest agriculture commodity traders in the world accounting for more than half of all estimated trade in the sector. According to shipment records obtained in Earthsight’s investigation Bunge alone exported 17 million tons of soy products from Brazil to 16 European countries between 2014 and May 2022. Cargill exported more than 13.7 million tons the report said.

Both companies have spent decades defending themselves against accusations of environmental negligence and human rights violations and not just in Brazil. In 2019 Cargill soy was identified as a driver of deforestation in the Gran Chaco region of Argentina Bolivia and Paraguay.

A Bunge spokesperson told Earthsight it doesn’t have the Brasília do Sul property in its database. A Cargill spokesperson said the company was aware soy was coming from the area but also said the farm’s activity didn’t violate the company’s policies. The Brazilian government hasn’t finished demarcating the land as Indigenous it said and therefore crops grown there are not subject to purchase restrictions.

“The mentioned area of Brasília do Sul farm is not regulated yet so there’s no illegality on the local produce” its statement said. “If we find any violation of our policies and commitments the farmer will be immediately blocked from our supply chain.”

Violence and deforestation on Indigenous land have increased since President Jair Bolsonaro took office at the start of 2019. His government has largely prioritized agribusiness and extractive industries over the rights of Indigenous and local peoples.

The Bolsonaro government has to date not demarcated any territory belonging to Indigenous peoples despite the Brazilian Constitution ensuring their land rights Ramos said. The lengthy process of demarcation has given agribusiness operators a loophole for continuing irresponsible practices while creating additional barriers for communities trying to obtain protections.

Thirteen states including Mato Grosso do Sul have struck down the policy that Indigenous lands that are still in the process of demarcation are fair game for all in response to injunctions that argued this violates Brazil’s Constitution. Nevertheless land grabbing and agricultural activity have continued.

“Under Bolsonaro everything related to Indigenous peoples’ rights became very difficult” Mauricio Santoro a political science professor at the Rio de Janeiro State University told Mongabay. “The president said he would not demarcate even one more inch of land for them. He put military officers in charge of many of [the Indigenous affairs agency’s] local offices and left the institution with few resources to fulfill its mission.”

In its report Earthsight said Cargill and Bunge need to take a firmer stance on Indigenous rights rather than passing off responsibility to intermediaries or contradicting Brazilian law. It also said the companies need to do a better job of tracing where their products come from and whether they’re contributing to violence against vulnerable communities.

“Cargill and Bunge’s unimpressive stance on Indigenous rights or traceability means consumers in Europe and elsewhere buying chicken pork dairy and other products linked to soy supply chains are often made unwitting contributors to the violence and marginalization experienced by Indigenous communities” the report said.

Campbell on the “People Every Day” podcast this week confirmed that he is gay. The five-time Grammy nominee said he never intended to keep his true self a secret from fans. Referring to his early 1990s heyday he nonetheless acknowledged “You just couldn’t be [gay] back then.”

“I didn’t hide anything about me. I didn’t try to act a certain way or anything” the pop and R&B singer 45 said. “What makes me happiest right now is how far I’ve come in life. You know there are a lot of child stars that don’t make it. But a lot of us do … and the fact that I’ve embraced me.”

He added: “When I came out to my family and friends [at] about 19 or 20 that was it for me. And then I went on the road of discovering myself. I didn’t know who I was.”

Media speculation about Campbell’s private life can be traced back to 1999 when he was arrested for “soliciting a lewd act” from an undercover police officer and later pleaded no contest.

In a 2003 interview with the now-defunct publication Sister 2 Sister he reportedly described himself as a “Try-Sexual” noting: “I’m not gay but I’m a freak and I think a lot of people know what a freak is. Basically I’m trying a lot of things. Being open-minded. It has nothing to do with attraction.”

In March of this year he appeared to hint at his sexuality while responding to a fan in a since-deleted tweet that was captured by Out magazine and other news outlets.

“Tevin is” he said while quote-tweeting a fan who wrote: “My mom keeps telling me Luther Vandross Teddy Pendergrass and Tevin Campbell were gay.” The tweet included a rainbow flag emoji.

Elsewhere in his “People Every Day” chat  Campbell touched on other Black queer stars like Lil Nas X and Frank Ocean whose careers haven’t appeared to be impacted negatively after they came out as LGBTQ.

“It wasn’t like that in the ’90s but I’m glad I get to see it” he explained. “I’m glad that’s changing. There are a lot of kids especially young Black boys that need to see representation.”

""I didn’t hide anything about me"" Campbell said of learning to embrace his truth as a gay man. ""I didn’t try to act a certain way or anything."" (Photo: Paras Griffin via Getty Images)

A Quincy Jones’ protégé Campbell released his debut album “T.E.V.I.N.” in 1991. His second album “I’m Ready” was released two years later. It yielded the No. 1 smash “Can We Talk” along with the title track and two hit singles “Always in My Heart” and “Don’t Say Goodbye Girl.”

From the sounds of it Campbell is aiming for another artistic triumph telling People he plans on returning the studio this year to record new music. Interestingly he credits his 2005 run in Broadway’s “Hairspray” ― where he was one of actor Corey Reynolds’ replacements in the role of Seaweed J. Stubbs ― with helping him to embrace his queer truth.

“Being around people who were like me LGBTQ+ people that were living normal lives and had partners” he said. “I had never seen that”

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Au premier trimestre 523 000 personnes ont démissionné dont 469 000 en CDI. Le Parisien et Les Echos en parlent dans leurs éditions de ce 19 août tout en assurant que ce n’est ni surprenant ni inquiétant.

On a souvent reproché aux Français leur manque de mobilité en termes d’emploi

Les démissions en France sont en hausse mais il n’y a rien de très surprenant expliquent Les Echos. La « grande démission » est donc un phénomène à relativiser. Les salariés cherchent en fait à profiter du dynamisme du marché de l’emploi car le phénomène ne se traduit pas par un retrait massif du marché du travail. 8 démissionnaires sur 10 ont retrouvé un emploi dans les 6 mois qui ont suivi ce n’est pas une grande démission mais plutôt une grande rotation écrit dans son édito Lucie Robequain. S’ils démissionnent c’est pour travailler ailleurs pas pour contempler les cieux. On a suffisamment reproché aux Français leur manque de mobilité poursuit-elle pour ne pas saluer leur soudaine bougeotte.

Mickaël Orand auteur de cette étude précise que « quand l’économie repart il y a toujours davantage de démissions. On l’a constaté historiquement lors de toutes les crises que ce soit celle de 2000 ou celle de 2008 ». Il souligne même que « c’est parce que le marché du travail est dynamique que les gens démissionnent ». Interrogé pour Radio Classique par Emilie Valès ce statisticien explique qu’il ne faut pas avoir d’inquiétudes liées à ces démissions « le taux d’emploi est à un niveau historiquement élevé on n’a jamais autant travaillé qu’aujourd’hui en France ». 68% des Français de 18 à 65 ans ont un emploi aujourd’hui. « Entre le nombre d’emplois vacants le nombre d’emplois à pourvoir et le chômage qui diminue ce sont les salariés qui sont en position de force dans la négociation sur le marché du travail » conclut-il.

Réunis en Conseil des ministres le mercredi 17 août 2022 les membres du gouvernement malien se sont convenus de l’impérieuse nécessité de la création d’une école du renseignement assurant la pérennité de la fonction renseignement.

Le Conseil des ministres a passé au peigne fin mercredi plusieurs rapports de différents ministères. Sur le rapport du ministre de la Défense et des Anciens Combattants le Conseil des ministres a adopté un projet de décret fixant l’organisation et les modalités de fonctionnement de la Direction de la Sécurité Militaire.

« La Direction de la sécurité militaire a été créée par la Loi n°95-038 du 20 avril 1995 avec pour mission d’élaborer et de mettre en œuvre les éléments de la politique nationale en matière de renseignements militaires » rappelle le communiqué du Conseil des ministres qui ajoute: « la restructuration en cours des Forces Armées a révélé l’impérieuse nécessité de relire le décret fixant son organisation et ses modalités de fonctionnement ».

En effet le projet de décret adopté apporte des innovations parmi lesquelles on peut citer: la mise en place de sous-directions chargées des Ressources humaines du Renseignement militaire de la contre ingérence de l’analyse documentation des finances et logistique et la mise en place d’une structure en charge de la coopération avec les services étrangers dans le cadre d’un partenariat transsaharien de lutte contre le terrorisme.

A cela s’ajoute la création d’une école du renseignement assurant la pérennité de la fonction renseignement et la séparation des domaines du renseignement d’intérêt militaire et de la contre ingérence.

Cette nouvelle organisation permettra selon les autorités militaires maliennes de mieux coordonner les activités de renseignements avec les Forces Armées et de Sécurité ainsi que les corps paramilitaires et de répondre aux défis sécuritaires.

L’annonce de la création d’une école de renseignement intervient au lendemain d’un courrier adressé à l’ONU par le chef de la diplomatie malienne. Dans sa note le diplomate Abdoulaye Diop qui demande une réunion urgente du Conseil de Sécurité sur la situation de son pays accuse la France de soutenir militairement les terroristes au Mali. L’Hexagone fournir des renseignements et des armes aux groupes ennemis selon M. Diop qui dit avoir des preuves palpables de ses accusations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXNzaXIuZnIvbWFjaGluaXNtZS9wZXRpdHMtdnMtZ3Jvcy1yb2JvdHMtZmF1dC1zb3Bwb3NlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petits vs gros robots : faut-il les opposer ?,"La robotique connaît un véritable essor dans le monde agricole. La difficulté de trouver de la main-d’œuvre qualifiée ou non constitue la motivation première vers ces solutions automatisées. Après s’être largement démocratisées dans l’élevage avec les robots de traite et plus récemment les robots d’alimentation le maraîchage et les cultures pérennes (vignes et vergers) sont les domaines les plus avancés avec des solutions devenues des réalités commerciales. Animés par des batteries électriques ou des motorisations hybrides ces robots ne travaillent qu’un rang ou une planche à chaque passage et affichent des dimensions modestes. Les faibles besoins de puissance leur procurent une bonne autonomie approchant généralement une journée.

Du côté des grandes cultures les robots peuvent être classés en plusieurs familles. La première regroupe les robots conçus sur la base de tracteurs. John Deere et CNH (Case IH/New Holland) commercialisent d’ailleurs depuis quelques mois leurs premiers modèles de l’autre côté de l’Atlantique principalement des modèles de forte puissance. Des constructeurs nippons comme Yanmar ou Kubota distribuent toute une gamme de tracteurs et autres automoteurs robotisés au pays du Soleil Levant. Ces engins disposent d’une motorisation thermique et d’une cabine et ne diffèrent des versions non automatisées que par l’ajout de capteurs de sécurité les rendant autonomes. Ils peuvent être pilotés par un opérateur en cabine notamment pour les déplacements routiers. Ils prétendent à une autonomie et une performance de traction comparables aux versions avec chauffeurs et peuvent donc réaliser des travaux de traction lourde.

Avec ou sans cabine

Certains constructeurs ont fait le choix de supprimer la cabine à l’image du premier tracteur à quatre roues motrices autonome dévoilé par Case IH au Sima 2017 ou plus récemment par Krone et Lemken qui ont décidé de s’associer pour développer un robot de 230 ch. Le concept de robot dévoilé par Kubota en 2020 se démarque par l’adoption de quatre chenilles. Pour les manœuvres d’entrée ou de sortie de champ ces engins à quatre roues motrices sont pilotés à distance depuis une radiocommande ou une tablette.

Le prototype à quatre roues Sesam 2 de John Deere reprend le même esprit à ceci près qu’il se distingue par une motorisation électrique : la cabine devient un accessoire que l’on attelle et dételle sur le relevage avant.

Le concept Joker de John Deere présenté à Agritechnica 2019 mais aussi le premier robot dévoilé par Horsch reprend une interface motrice diesel puissante dotée de deux chenilles sur laquelle on vient atteler différents outils traînés. Sur le concept de Horsch l’unité motrice est simplement tractée par un camion ou un tracteur lors des déplacements entre parcelles.

Des petits robots autonomes en énergie

Ce constructeur allemand a également dévoilé un autre prototype plus radical où le robot est dédié au semis et affiche des dimensions peu compatibles avec les déplacements routiers une solution qu’on aura peu de chances de voir dans nos contrées ouest-européennes. Avec son robot d’affouragement Exos Lely fait également le pari de l’appareil spécialisé.

L’idée de spécialiser le robot à une voire deux tâches n’est pourtant pas loin d’être unique et constitue le point commun de la majorité des constructeurs de petits robots. L’appareil autonome Avo du Suisse Ecorobotix est électrique autonome en énergie grâce à ses panneaux solaires mais bénéficiant de batteries interchangeables pour allonger la journée de travail. Il est dédié au désherbage chimique réalisé de façon ultra localisé à l’aide de caméras et d’une intelligence artificielle qui pilote les applications uniquement sur les adventices : il peut traiter jusqu’à 10 hectares par jour. Doté également de panneaux solaires le robot FD20 de Farmdroid pulvérise aussi mais réalise également du semis de précision. Chaque graine implantée est géolocalisée ce qui facilite la distinction des adventices et des cultures. Il est prévu pour travailler sur 20 hectares. Transportés sur une remorque ou un plateau ces petits robots présentent l’avantage d’être peu gourmands en énergie et de ne pas générer de tassement important des sols. En intervenant plus fréquemment et de manière ultralocalisée ces engins limitent les besoins en phytosanitaires en ne traitant qu’une faible surface et à des stades de croissance plus précoces des adventices.

Avec son prototype BlueBob Naïo dédie le robot au désherbage mécanique. Il n’est en revanche pas autonome en énergie nécessitant une recharge quotidienne.

Des petits robots qui travaillent en groupe

De son côté Fendt a également fait le choix de petits robots compacts et légers dédiés au semis. Le constructeur allemand pousse jusqu’à faire travailler toute une flotte de robots en essaim chacun ayant sa mission sur une surface prédéterminée. Mais si l’un d’entre eux tombe en panne la répartition des tâches est modifiée : les surfaces à réaliser par chaque robot sont revues à la hausse et la surface dédiée initialement au robot défectueux partagée avec les autres robots.

Entre les deux écoles (petits et gros robots) il n’y a pas forcément d’opposition. Les petits présentent l’avantage de ne pas compacter les sols et se montrent peu énergivores. Si leur débit de chantier n’est pas élevé la possibilité de travailler sans discontinuer voire en groupe leur permet de réaliser leur mission avec succès. En revanche leur utilisation se limite à des applications au-dessus du sol ou en travail superficiel (binage semis). Pour du travail du sol plus profond ou nécessitant des débits de chantier élevés (récolte) les engins puissants restent aujourd’hui nécessaires. Finalement les petits et gros robots se montrent plutôt complémentaires proposant un bon compromis entre respect des sols et tâches à effectuer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1bmlvbi5mci9pZDM5OTk5Mi9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjItMDgtMTgvcXVlc3QtaWwtYXJyaXZlLWF1eC1waW5zLW1lZGl0ZXJyYW5uZWVucy1kdS1yb25kLXBvaW50LWRlLWxhLWdhcmUtY2hhbG9ucy1lbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qu'est-il arrivé aux pins méditerrannéens près du rond-point de la gare de Châlons-en-Champagne?,Ils étaient là dressés dans le paysage urbain comme trois éléments fidèles assurant une végétation et donnant même un léger air « du Sud » à ce pan de trottoir devant la Mission locale.

The Air Senegal flight operated by TransAir was set to take off from the Blaise Diagne airport in the country’s capital of Dakar and fly to the city of Bamako in Mali on Thursday around midnight when the plane ""came off the runway during its take-off phase"" Senegal Transport Minister El Malick Ndiaye told reporters.

The plane skidded into the grass that flanked the runway where crew were able to deploy the side exit ramps and ferry passengers off the plane as it started to burn.

""Our plane just caught fire at Blaise Diagne airport"" Cheick Siriman Sissoko a Malian musician wrote in a post on Facebook along with a video of rescue crews helping passengers evacuate the plane. An orange glow is visible under the jet.

The plane was carrying 79 passengers two pilots and four cabin crew according to Ndiaye. The airport has opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident the Independent reported.

""Carriers operate and maintain their airplanes for upwards of 30 to 40 years"" Boeing said in a statement to FOX Business referring to TransAir for further questions but assuring that the company ""will provide any requested support to our customers.""

The plane in question was first delivered 30 years ago to Romanian company TAROM before TransAir leased it starting this year according to Plane Spotters. The plane had previously suffered a tail issue during takeoff but returned to service a month later.

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report.

He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page.

He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post.

“This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site.

“Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row.

A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas."""

It can be an organic process that happens as a company evolves advancing its operations and technology usage. It can also be more purposeful and strategic a focus area for a business that is empowering and educating its people. No matter what spurs innovation on what is clear is that it takes effort; innovation happens with the hard work of many people like Edwin Bailey Sr. Preconstruction Technologist for Skanska.

Skanska is one of the most innovative construction companies in the world and this reputation has been earned through a long-term commitment to always do better. Within the firm Edwin is one of the many champions of technology and drivers of change.

On September 27-28 Edwin will join like-minded peers and innovators at Autodesk University 2022 in New Orleans. He will share how Skanska is driving collaboration in his session Autodesk Model Coordination for Design and Construction Streamlines Process.

REGISTER NOW

We recently had the opportunity to speak to Edwin about his career and how he drives coordination across design and construction. Here’s what he had to share.

Tell us about your career.

I’ve always loved learning new things and sharing new ideas with others. I started out studying fine art engineering and architecture then business and technology. During my career I’ve also worked in different roles within the AEC industry.

While working on my bachelor's I gravitated toward the emerging technologies of Building Information Modeling (BIM). I implemented the new tech at a small but nimble architecture firm first while finishing school and then helped a large firm of 500 architects with their BIM implementation fresh out of college. I was committed to getting a master's degree in architecture but one of my professors suggested that since I had a desirable skill I should first gain experience in the industry. I’m extremely glad I did because after a short time I decided to get a Master in Business Technology Commercialization instead which was the closest thing to an innovation MBA available.

Since then I’ve had the opportunity to work on many reputable projects with companies in architecture subcontracting general contracting and real estate development. All my roles have revolved around technology and innovation across the country.

I really enjoy working at Skanska because I get to help drive change within our organization and our industry. For example my interest in data started with BIM but has since expanded across business departments into more holistic business analytics. I like pushing current boundaries with data usage for actionable insights.

What are the biggest challenges you face in your role? And how do you tackle these challenges?

Technology changes faster than people do. Also new technology is only as good as the people who know how to use it effectively. Knowledge transfer is one of the biggest challenges. How do we combine key industry expertise and knowledge with the latest technology tools and innovations? Solutions need to be easy enough to use so that our most seasoned field personnel can apply their knowledge while using them. Training should also be simple and intuitive. When solutions are simple to use it takes less motivation to get people to step out of their comfort zone and try new things.

One challenge that’s common across the industry is leveraging data for better business decisions. Data empowers people to make better decisions that can have a positive cumulative impact. It can inform decisions throughout the lifecycle of a project from conceptual design and planning throughout construction to building occupancy and maintenance. The type of data we collect and the methods for collecting it constantly evolve. Currently databases themselves are starting to capture industry knowledge and provide greater predictive insights. The latest business analytics tools are great for helping people better understand and leverage that data. Still using data is an art form and science and it’s important we become more familiar with data and analytics so we can realize all of its benefits.

""When solutions are simple to use it takes less motivation to get people to step out of their comfort zone and try new things.""

Another challenge I’ve faced is getting others to see technology as more than just another tool. I see great things on the skyline for the industry as it continues to evolve and change. To me technology is more than just a tool it’s a medium. It is both the paint and the brush. In a way we all get to use technology to create and share knowledge and insights. Innovation happens when people apply technology data and industry expertise to modify the way we do business. Innovation is effort.

How can attending in-person events like Autodesk University have an impact on you not only professionally but personally as well?

No matter where you are in your career there's always room to grow and improve. Events like Autodesk University are an opportunity for people to collaborate and share their passion and knowledge with others. There is always the excitement of what new innovations you might see during a presentation or on the expo floor that inspire you. It’s also a terrific opportunity for getting hands-on with new hardware or software while seeing how others solve similar problems you might be working on.

Networking is another key aspect of AU. It’s an opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in person rather than over another virtual meeting. You also get to meet many folks behind the scenes of your favorite Autodesk applications. AU attracts many strategic industry partners that we want to connect with. Connecting with peers and sharing experiences is so valuable. It is how knowledge transfer happens!

Everyone who attends AU will always take something back with them whether that’s connections through networking understanding new technology ideas from knowledge sharing or business innovations.

Can you tell us about what you will be presenting at Autodesk University?

In my case study session Autodesk Model Coordination for Design and Construction Streamlines Process (September 29 11:30 AM CS501429) I will be presenting how to leverage Autodesk cloud-based tools for increased collaboration among all stakeholders of a building project. This will include best practices and lessons learned for design and construction model coordination.

I’ll talk about our beta experience in 2018 when we started using model coordination during the design phase on key projects. I’ll also share recent project examples where we used model coordination with subcontractors on some of our largest commercial projects in Texas. We did this without needing to use a desktop application like Navisworks to run clash detection which is currently an industry standard.

From my perspective each building is a functioning work of art that requires a team to build it. Each stakeholder contributes value to the overall outcome of the project including the craftsperson construction manager engineer architect and owner. The better we all collaborate the less roadblocks a project will have and the higher quality project we will all provide to the owner and building occupants.

Can you give us an example of how cloud-based technology can be used to streamline coordination during both design and construction?

In general people have a hard time visualizing a mental picture of 2D construction documents. To this day you might see design meetings where each discipline sits around a table with hard copies of their drawings and marks them up as they all try to create and coordinate a mental picture of the combined project.

As great as it can be to all sit together around a table in person with cloud-based technology you don’t have to be in the same room. Everyone has near real-time access to project information. You have digital 2D documents that can be marked up virtually. In addition each document is linked to its corresponding 3D discipline model. The team can combine discipline models and run clash detection early on in design and during construction coordination. Stakeholders can generate and assign issues and run reports. Each issue has its own instant messaging built in for enhanced communication that can be used as follow-ups from group meetings.

Model coordination allows for easy visualization navigation and a better understanding of design intent between all stakeholders. Skanska's preconstruction and operations experts take advantage of the 3D clash detection tool during design to provide constructability analysis and QC the models' data. Through assigned issues active messaging and automated reports communication and accountability are enhanced. We utilize a similar cloud-based workflow when coordinating shop drawing models with our subcontractors.

How does streamlining coordination impact the whole project team from owners designers stakeholders and construction managers?

Skanska leverages cloud-based tools to increase collaboration communication and transparency building trust among owners designers stakeholders and construction managers. Real-time access to information benefits all project stakeholders and helps ensure a more coordinated design budget and project quality.

The cloud streamlines coordination and the flow of information and ideas. Quicker and better design and construction decisions are made when everyone has access to the information they need. You don’t need to wait weeks for files to be updated combined and shared. You can zero in on key issues and their resolution quickly and review information without having to sift through old emails. Transparency is key to any project and we’ve seen increased involvement from owners better collaboration between design disciplines and increased project understanding between construction and design.

For example on a 28-story office tower development in Houston the entire project team actively participated in 3D design model coordination to improve the quality of construction documents. There was also more interaction and feedback between subcontractors and all other stakeholders while coordinating the 3D construction models used for shop drawings. A simplified user experience meant that team members didn’t have to be gurus at 3D model navigation to apply their knowledge and expertise. In fact none of our team members had previously used Autodesk’s model coordination but they quickly picked it up and worked remotely across the country in the cloud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1idWlsZC1pbnRlcnZpZXctd2l0aC1zaG9sYS15dXN1Zi1wcm9qZWN0LWVuZ2luZWVyLWF0LWFybXN0cm9uZy1haXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind the Build: Interview with Shola Yusuf Project Engineer at Armstrong Air - Digital Builder,"The willingness to embrace technology and the aptitude to learn technical skills are some of the most valuable characteristics you can have as a construction professional today. The world is moving at an incredibly rapid pace and in order to stay ahead firms must adopt tools that enable them to work smarter faster and with greater accuracy.

Project Engineer Shola Yusuf has seen first-hand just how game-changing technology can be in the construction industry. Shola specializes in mechanical engineering at Armstrong Air and Heat an HVAC company that provides cooling and heating solutions to commercial and residential properties.

We recently caught up with Shola and asked him to talk more about his career and how technology has made an impact on his role.

Let’s dive in!

Tell me a little bit about Armstrong Air and what you specialize in.

Armstrong is a contractor that specializes in HVAC installation for both residential and commercial properties. Our mission is to continue satisfying the customer and make clients happy. We are also LEED-certified.

Walk us through your career and what led you to becoming Project Engineer.

I began my career as a mechanical engineer back from school in Africa Nigeria. I started at one of the leading consulting firms in Nigeria where I acquired skills in design and MEP. From there I moved to Mar & Mor where I gained experience in project management. Now I'm here in Armstrong as a project engineer who liaises with both internal and external stakeholders.

As a project engineer I analyze the project specifications and the development of work schedules. I also coordinate plans and work with project managers and preconstruction teams.

What is your proudest accomplishment in your career at Armstrong Air? Why?

My proudest accomplishment has always been my ability to be productive. I strive to support the project management team to meet all their requirements and requests. Ultimately I’m proud to help our teams accomplish the organization's goal: to make our customers happy by delivering good products and services. I truly get a lot of enjoyment from that.

As construction evolves how do you see the role of Project Engineer changing?

I believe the construction sector will continue revolving around technology. So those entering the industry would need to continually acquire more technical skills. In the next five years I'm expecting to see a lot of high-tech innovation—more than what we have right now.

What are the biggest challenges you face in your role? How does technology help you overcome those challenges?

One of the greatest challenges I'm facing in my role is dealing with time—or the lack of it. You now have less time to accomplish a lot of things. With the help of software you can multitask more and achieve a lot within a short period.

If you are handling five six or ten projects with your software you can analyze and manage them easily.

Software and technology have simplified things making it easy for people to work. It has decreased the amount of time required to deliver a lot of projects.

Speaking of Autodesk Construction Cloud products why are you excited about implementing Autodesk Build over the next few months?

Autodesk Construction Cloud helps you work more effectively so you can be more efficient and profitable. Tools like Autodesk enable teams to work more effectively and thus breaking the barrier of time delivery.

In terms of features I like RFI and Issues because they make things easier to track. I also like the reports. When you log into a particular project you can easily track the progress of work.

When it comes to detail Autodesk's Cost Management module has an edge over competitors. With Autodesk you can see a lot of detail. That's one of the reasons we selected it over other competitors. We like how the budget synchronizes with cost change orders and forecasting. We can easily track where change orders affect the scope of our work.

""When it comes to detail Autodesk's Cost Management module has an edge over competitors.""

Armstrong has always been committed to delivering quality projects to our clients. And we have seen Autodesk as one of the tools necessary for us to continue delivering high-quality work. That’s one of the reasons we partnered with Autodesk.

When you think about the future what are your plans to advance innovation and productivity at Armstrong Air?

It’s always been a principle of Armstrong to advance technology and innovation. We’ll continue focusing on tools and technologies that enable us to get ahead of our competitors deliver good products and make our customers happy. That’s why we’re always analyzing which tools are better or which solutions enable us to be faster deliver more efficiently and be more productive.

What advice would you give to the next generation of men and women entering and preparing for the future of the industry?

It’s all about technology. If you’re entering this industry you must ensure you acquire a lot of technical skills and continue updating yourself with the latest technologies and innovations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9mdXNpb24tMzYwL2Jsb2cvZ2VuZXJhdGl2ZS1kZXNpZ24tc2ltdWxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Just Finished a Generative Design Study — What's Next?,"Generative design in Fusion 360 goes beyond running studies. Explore how to easily edit parts run simulations and more.

There’s nothing quite like the satisfying feeling of optimizing a design for performance and manufacturability with generative design. However in all the excitement of creating a new study it can be easy to forget how flexible and dynamic the tool actually is.

Like any other tool it’s up to you to best apply generative design to your workflow. If you’re looking to take your workflow to the next level here are some things you may not know the tool can do:

Easily edit your generative design parts

Next time you produce a study know that you still have options. A converged study doesn’t have to mean the end of your process. Sometimes you want to use a generatively designed part as is and sometimes it doesn’t meet your desired aesthetic language. Maybe you want to add some symmetry smooth out some surface tension or use the part geometry as a basis for something entirely new built by hand. All of these options are legitimate and possible.

When you download and open a generative part in Fusion 360 it comes with a timeline pre-populated with features used to reconstruct the design. You can edit these features to modify the part as you see fit.

Remember that what the generative design tool initially produces is the most optimized form for your mechanical specifications. If you change the part you will also change its performance. That’s where simulation comes in.

Check part performance in the Fusion 360 Simulation Workspace

Did you know that generatively designed parts carry over their study data? It’s true! When you switch to the Simulation Workspace a prompt will appear asking if you’d like to use your part’s study data for simulation setups.

Simulation results will give you a wealth of detailed information about how your design performs under all the loading conditions it will be under. Results can also be a valuable validation tool just as if you’d made a CAD model yourself.

Generative design studies are pre-populated with the loading information you used to create your setup letting you run a simulation study with the click of a button.

Simulation can also be a great way to consider physical requirements that are impossible to set up as objectives for generative design such as thermal stresses or dynamic loads. You can think about generative design as an intelligent CAD modeler that creates a highly efficient shape that might be 95% of the way to your final design. You can then use a combination of simulation and the highly editable generative design outcome to fine-tune our results and account for specific part performance requirements or to put our own aesthetic stamp on the final shape.

This ability is convenient when continuing to work on generatively designed parts as you can check their performance and make changes.

Run an event simulation to test your part “IRL”

Generative Design is an incredibly powerful tool for refining your part to its idealized geometry specifically for linear static stress conditions. However that doesn’t necessarily answer all the questions you might have. You may need to answer additional questions about how your part performs. For example you can also run an event simulation to see how your part will perform under a specific condition. One of the most common conditions to test is an impact collision.

This is just the beginning though. Generatively designed parts can also test for thermal stress (e.g. is heat transferring through your assembly now that you’ve introduced a generatively designed part?). You can also put parts back into an assembly.



Use generative design when you want it how you want it

These are just a few tips for incorporating generative design into your workflow in new ways. Our best advice? Experiment! Try using a mix of generative design and traditional modeling to produce foundational geometry to work from. Or even remix your study by introducing a solved part. The generative design world is your oyster.

The percentage of high school students enrolling at the state’s 13 universities has been falling since 2013 according to UW System data. Historically 32 percent of high school grads have enrolled at UW schools immediately after graduation. That fell to about 27 percent in 2020.

During a Thursday meeting of the UW Board of Regents in Green Bay members heard a presentation about how a policy known as “direct admissions” could temper the trend.

Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Professor of Higher Education Jennifer Delaney has researched the approach and told the board direct admissions works by offering automatic admission to high school seniors who meet certain grade point average or standardized test score thresholds.

She said direct admissions sidesteps the traditional application process which places the impetus on students and parents to fill out multiple college applications in hopes of getting a response. With direct admissions students parents and high school counselors are proactively notified about an open spot.

“Right now we’re having individuals do individual searches for college” said Delaney. “Those with parents who’ve gone to college have a real advantage.”

Delaney said moving toward a universal admissions policy could help reduce racial and income-based disparities in higher education.

“We’ve gone for a long time in this country thinking that open access institutions means there’s a place for everyone” Delaney said. “But students don’t always know that and particularly more vulnerable populations don’t know what open access means or that there’s a place for them.”

The direct admissions approach is relatively new. Idaho was the first state to try it in 2015. Other states like Hawaii and Minnesota have followed suit.

UW-Madison education professor Taylor Odle has researched the topic with Delaney and said more than 120000 high school students in Idaho have been proactively admitted to college since direct admissions started.

Odle said data shows Idaho and other states using automatic admissions have seen results.

“We actually find that these impacts at the campus level range from between 4 and 8 percent for full-time undergraduate enrollees” said Odle. “And this was predominantly driven by new in-state students coming in.”

Odle said Idaho also noted a 3 percent decrease in the number of high school students leaving to attend out-of-state colleges.

Minnesota has launched a direct admissions pilot program beginning this fall in which students high schools and public or private colleges can opt in. Individual schools can set their own GPA thresholds.

Regents discuss college affordability

Later on Thursday regents heard a presentation about how college affordability may play into declining enrollment. UW System Associate Vice President for Policy Analysis and Research Ben Passmore told the board that all UW schools are more affordable than peer institutions relative to the average family income of students.

“But the general rise in costs in higher education since the beginning of this century and accelerating as we got through the Great Recession have impacted the perceived and the actual affordability” said Passmore. “And it leaves us with a substantial problem to be solved.”

Passmore said data show the number of new UW System freshmen from families making more than $100000 per year has increased from 29 percent of the 2011 cohort to 46 percent in the 2020-21 school year.

“And that is not because we’ve gotten richer” said Passmore. “It’s because our students the students that we are attracting are from wealthier families.”

Passmore said the same is true even for first-generation college students and those from groups the UW System identify as underrepresented.

Passmore said the portion of students from the wealthiest families is likely higher. Family income data comes from the Free Application for Federal Application for Federal Student Aid and students from wealthier families generally don’t fill out the application.

Since the 2011-12 school year the average annual cost of attendance at UW schools has risen from $18046 to $21896 according to UW System data. That’s despite a freeze on in-state tuition increases that’s been in place since 2013.

With financial aid taken into account the average net cost per year at UW system schools has increased from $12129 in the 2011-2012 school year to $14468 in the 2020-21 school year according to UW data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9ubHAyY2hhcnQtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tdmlzdWFsaXphdGlvbi1pbi1uYXR1cmFsLWxhbmd1YWdlLXBhcnQtMi1hMzI1YzVlNjM2ZGPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NLP2Chart — Information Visualization in Natural Language -Part 2 | by Andreas Stöckl,"NLP2Chart — Information Visualization in Natural Language -Part 2

The interface / Image by the author

In a previous article I presented a prototype of a method that allows the creation of information graphs and plots using instructions in natural language. In this article I would like to give an extended and revised version and show the results of a study with users alongside some examples.

The work was presented at the 26th International Conference Information Visualisation (IV) on 19–22 July 2022 at the “Technische Universität Wien Austria” and the paper appears in the conference publications.

Natural Language Interfaces in Information Visualization Software

Natural language interfaces have already found their way into software products for visual data analysis. They are designed to help people analyze and visualize data using various analytical methods. The market leaders in commercial software ”Tableau” and Microsoft with ”Power BI” have integrated corresponding components in their current releases.

With Tableau’s ”Ask Data” you can enter a question in a common language and immediately receive an answer directly in Tableau. The answers come in the form of automatic data visualizations without you having to manually drag and drop fields invoke menus or understand the intricacies of the data structure.

Microsoft’s counterpart is called ”Power BI Q&A”. However getting the instructions right is still a major hurdle for users. More powerful language models may be able to help here.

In recent years powerful new language models based on the Transformer architecture have emerged through pretraining on large text datasets dominating all current NLP benchmarks. The aim of this work is to explore whether and in what way NLIs for data visualization benefit from these models. For this purpose I have created a prototype of visualization software based on the OpenAI Codex model.

A second prototype implements the baseline pipeline for NL-based data visualization. It uses the open-source ”Natural Language for Data Visualization”(NL4DV) toolkit to interpret NL utterances. The toolkit takes as input a dataset and an utterance corresponding to that dataset returning a JSON object that includes an ordered list of Vega-Lite specifications that can be presented as output.

The Interface

In order to test the possibilities of chart generation with the help of a deep learning language model a prototype of a web application was created that allows data visualizations to be created using text inputs and then refined with context-related palettes. The text commands are used to define the basic structure of the visualizations and the palettes can then be used to set additional specifications such as line widths or colors (Figure above). The prototype is a mixed-initiative visualization system that allows both NL input and direct manipulation interactions through a graphical user interface (GUI).

For data handling the prototype offers the possibility to upload CSV files or to load already existing ones via a select box. Below this the data fields are displayed together with their data type. As export options PNG images and an HTML export are provided in the prototype.

In addition to the possibility of watching a short tutorial video the central area of the screen offers a multi-line text input field in which the instructions are entered in natural language. Below this the generated visualization is displayed. In one prototype variant this is a Matplotlib graphic and in the other a Vega-Lite chart.

GUI elements / Image by the author

The right column offers in addition to the text commands some GUI elements. A title can be assigned the axes can be labeled and the limits can be set. Other elements such as line width color palettes or colors of bars are displayed depending on the chart type created.

Architecture of the Application

Both versions of the prototype were realized as a web application with Python. The framework ”Streamlit” was used in each case. Data can be processed in CSV format and exported as PNG or HTML. The two variants differ in terms of NLP and visualization. The following chart shows the system architecture of the version using CodeX for code generation.

Details on the different parts can be found in the paper.

Examples

I tested the application with data from Gapminder.org on the evidence-based worldview for illustration and evaluation. The test persons had to solve the following exercises:

Create histograms for the numerical characteristics Plot the numerical characteristics per continent using bar charts. Display the GDP per country with the help of a bar chart. The top 15 countries should be displayed in descending order. Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of the world’s population by continent. Create a graph that shows the time course of mean life expectancy averaged over all countries. Using a line chart for this. Show the relationship between GDP per inhabitant of a country and life expectancy with the help of a scatter diagram. In addition use a color code that reflects the population size. Show the relationship between GDP per inhabitant of a country and life expectancy and population size using a bubble chart.

Example of a chart output / Image by the author

Details on the experimental procedure can be found in the paper.

Results of the Tests

Participants gave the prototype with the deep learning language model an average SUS score of 71.1 and the version with NL4DV an average score of 68.2. A score of ≥ 68 is considered an indicator of good usability.

The evaluation showed that the deep learning model has the potential for expressive text input but does not always produce entirely predictable results and can therefore confuse users.

Future

The Codex language model I use is a model for generating general source code and is not optimized for our task. At present it is possible to fine-tune natural language variants of GPT3 via the API and thus the models can be better adapted to tasks. This is not yet possible for the Codex model. As soon as this is possible I expect great progress for my approach because here it will be possible to work specifically with source code to create infographics and thus more targeted charts.

Watson running software called DeepQA had been fed zillions of pages of information from encyclopedias and open-source projects for a few years before the match. Watson’s prep work paid off as Watson beat both champs in that game. “I for one welcome our new computer overlords” said Jennings riffing on a memorable quote from The Simpsons.

What Is Cognitive Computing?

Watson’s competitive edge was cognitive computing. Cognitive computing mimics the steps the human brain takes to solve problems. A distant relative of Watson Deep Blue a computer that beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a six-game match in 1997 (Kasparov won their first six-game match in 1996) is not cognitive computing because it was able to choose from hundreds of millions of moves plus “see” 20 moves ahead a feat which no human to date has been able to perform.

Cognitive computing is also not artificial intelligence though the two phrases are sometimes used interchangeably. Cognitive computing needs human assistance — for instance humans fed Watson the info it needed to compete in and win the Jeopardy! match. AI for its part uses algorithms to make its decisions.

While AI and cognitive computing are not synonymous AI is one of the building blocks for cognitive computing. Cognitive computing also employs machine learning deep learning neural networks natural language processing robotics expert systems speech and object recognition and robotics.

To mimic human brain processes cognitive computing systems must be adaptive meaning they must learn and adjust as information and the environment changes. They must be able to interact with other devices and platforms. They must be stateful — that is able to retain information about situations that have already occurred; be iterative or ask questions and harness additional data to clarify a problem; and be contextual meaning they must grasp the context in which information is being used.

Cognitive computing is used in healthcare to help physicians make the best decisions about how to treat patients. In retail and finance they capture customer data and use that to make personal recommendations on products to customers. In logistics cognitive computing helps with warehouse automation and management.

Patients with CAD have a high risk for recurrent cardiovascular events not only in lesions that were previously treated with PCI but also from untreated nonculprit lesion sites12. For lesions that were previously treated with PCI improvements in the drug-eluting stents and antiplatelet therapy have significantly decreased the risk for PCI-related secondary events10. On the other hand the rate of cardiovascular events from untreated nonculprit lesions remains very high despite intensive strategies for risk modification. Accordingly the effective identification of patients who are at a high risk of developing events from nonculprit lesions is crucial regarding the long-term care of CAD patients. OCT is a high-resolution intravascular imaging technique that uses near-infrared spectroscopy and it can differentiate plaque instability in vivo45. However the routine analysis of coronary lesions with OCT has practical limitations because of the large numbers of OCT images that need to be evaluated and OCT image interpretation requires substantial experience. To address this practical issue we sought to develop an AI algorithm as an accurate and automatic diagnostic tool for the vulnerability of nonculprit coronary plaques and evaluate the relation between AI diagnosis of plaque vulnerability and clinical outcomes in patients with CAD.

Various medical image analyses using deep learning have been studied as diagnostic aids for clinicians and these imaging modalities include CT images retinal fundic images pathological images mammography images and skin images1112. Recently Liu and colleagues reported the application of an AI program to OCT for coronary plaque characterization13. Based on their relatively small dataset they could detect vulnerable plaques with a good diagnostic accuracy (detection quality score 88.46%) using cross-sectional images (generated by a polar coordinate transformation) of the vessels. More recently Min and colleagues reported the application of an AI program to OCT for identifying thin-cap fibroatheroma using 602 coronary lesions from 602 angina patients and a developed AI program could accurately detect a thin-cap fibroatheroma (AUC = 0.96)14. The present study used raw OCT data instead of cross-sectional transformation images. Although this process is not intuitive for humans it is thought that information loss occurs due to the polar transformation. After a polar coordinate transformation the information in an image is sparser in the outer part of the image than in the center. Therefore the information loss is more significant in the outer part of the image. This can be complemented by bilinear or bicubic processing but these techniques are not sufficient. When DenseNet-121 was trained using the polar-transformed dataset the accuracy for the test data (dataset 2) was 89.5% which was 2.9 percentage points lower in accuracy than when using the raw data. In addition by using a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) it is possible to use the raw data of OCT images as the polar coordinate data without any information loss. This is a promising method for the future. However the OCT polar coordinate image used in the present study had 488064 nodes (984 × 496) in the raw data and 89401 nodes (299 × 299) in the resized images for input into the CNN model which is a very large data size for GCN computation and requires a high computational cost for training. Another notable feature of this study was that OCT images were prelabeled based on the consensus of three OCT experts. According to such a novel approach to training the AI algorithm demonstrated a very high diagnostic capability (92.4%) and this diagnostic rate was better than that of that from general cardiologists. The time between inputting a single OCT image into DenseNet-121 and obtaining the result was 35 ms; of course with a more powerful GPU it could be even faster. Such technology could support clinicians in decision-making and can reduce the burden of patient care. In addition since this is a very short amount of time there are potential applications for determining the plaque vulnerability by using a deep learning analysis of angiographic images in real time during coronary angiography and PCI.

In this study the relation between AI diagnosis of plaque vulnerability and clinical outcomes of CAD patients was also tested. To the best of our knowledge no previous study has used a well-defined cohort of OCT image samples with a well-established large clinical database to assess the clinical implications of medical AI with respect to its relation to future cardiac events. Several studies have attempted to use intravascular imaging for prognostic stratification. The PROSPECT I and II AtheroRemo-IVUS and LRP studies have shown the ability of grayscale IVUS radiofrequency IVUS and near-infrared spectroscopy IVUS to predict events in patients presenting with ACS and in stable patients undergoing an index PCI121516. These IVUS studies have demonstrated the importance of identifying high-risk lesions in patients with ischemic heart disease. We recently showed that vulnerable plaques that were diagnosed with OCT were associated with the subsequent progression of coronary stenosis as well as future major adverse cardiac events45. In the present study CAD patients with AI-diagnosed OCT vulnerable plaques had significantly worse lesion-specific outcomes. Furthermore the presence of AI-diagnosed vulnerable plaques was also associated with a higher incidence of composite clinical outcomes including noncardiac death in CAD patients. The reason for this finding is unclear but the comorbidities of CAD patients such as chronic inflammatory diseases and malignant tumors are known to correlate with enhanced plaque vulnerabilities in coronary arteries17. However the prognostic value of AI vulnerability for the lesion-specific events was higher (AUC = 0.719) than that for the composite of the clinical events (AUC = 0.590). These data suggested that AI diagnosis of plaque vulnerability might be more useful for evaluating the prognostic value form the OCT-observed segments rather than the composite of the clinical events including cardiac death noncardiac death and any clinically driven coronary revascularization.

In the present study patients with vulnerable plaques diagnosed by AI algorithm had a large number of coronary risk factors suggesting that this new technology could differentiate high-risk patients who should receive intensive medical management without the need for expertise and experience with OCT. Furthermore we will be able to adapt this new technology to noninvasive imaging modalities including coronary computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for predicting cardiovascular events in primary care settings in the future. In addition the automatic diagnosis of the plaque vulnerability by an AI program will provide useful information not only for the prognostic stratification but also for planning the PCI treatment strategies for patients in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The plaque characteristics of the stent edge landing zone may affect the stent length selection. Interventional cardiologists prefer to position the edges of the stents into reference segments that are normal or that are at least less diseased segments. A stent landing edge should be avoided in segments with a vulnerable plaque even if they have an angiographically normal appearance because of the possible development of stent edge dissection and stent edge restenosis. Therefore a quick diagnosis of the plaque vulnerability by an AI program is very useful in the cardiac catheterization laboratory when interventional cardiologists select the stent edge landing zone. From this perspective integration of an AI program in an OCT imaging apparatus might automatically and efficiently promote the practice of PCI and provide risk stratification of individual CAD patients. Furthermore the automatic determination and localization of vulnerable plaques with an AI program might help us change the PCI strategy as well as the medical treatment in individual CAD patients.

Limitations

Several limitations of the present study should be addressed. First this was a retrospective cohort analysis which may have selection bias. In addition information about the clinical characteristics including the lipid profiles at the follow-up was lacking. However a large number of CAD patients with complete baseline clinical characteristics were recruited. Second OCT images with severe calcification (calcification arc > 90°) were excluded from this study because the impact of severe calcification detected by OCT in de novo lesions on clinical outcomes remains controversial. Third lesions with OCT images that showed a fresh thrombus and/or plaque rupture indicating culprit lesions were excluded from this study. However all of the registered lesions were not functionally tested using a pressure guidewire. Therefore coronary angiograms have limitations in determining whether a lesion is culprit or nonculprit. Fourth to test the diagnostic capability of the AI program four general cardiologists who had different years of experience were recruited. Shibutani et al. recently evaluated the effect of the observers’ years of experience on the interpretation of OCT images with reference to the histopathological findings18. They reported that the interpretation ability of OCT varied significantly among observers and it is possible that there was a significant selection bias of the observers in the present study. Fifth the prognosis value of the AI vulnerability for the clinical outcomes in CAD patients was not actually higher than that of the OCT expert vulnerability (AUC of AI vulnerability: 0.590 AUC of expert vulnerability: 0.592). However the automatic analysis of numerous OCT images by AI-assisted computer systems without the input by expert cardiologists may be able to substantially distinguish patients who are at a high risk without additional workload to the medical staff and hospital resources. In this study the predictive capability of the algorithm on the clinical outcomes was not validated in an external independent patient cohort so a future prospective study is needed to confirm the present findings. Last the clinical event rates especially the incidence of acute coronary syndrome were low in the present study.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMDkxNjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,motilitAI: A machine learning framework for automatic prediction of human sperm motility,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222009166 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMDkxNjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Sean Higgins 31 of Palmyra would pretend to be a teen girl on either Snapchat or Instagram to begin his chats according to Burlington County Prosecutor LaChia Bradshaw.

He was first accused of the crimes while serving as youth pastor and music leader at Harbor Baptist Church in Hainesport in 2020.

Higgins also was a teacher at the Harbor Baptist Academy a private K-12 school within the same facility at that time.

A Burlington County Grand Jury has indicted Higgins on 75 total charges — 13 of them first-degree — that include endangering the welfare of a child aggravated sexual assault criminal sexual contact cyber harassment and obscenity to a minor.

Each of the victims ranged in age from 12 to 17 living in New Jersey Pennsylvania Alabama Michigan Minnesota South Dakota and Tennessee according to investigators.

There was no physical contact in any of the cases and none of the known victims were members of the church congregation or students at the school Bradshaw said.

Fake teen girl profile

After introducing himself as “Julie Miller” to each of the teen boys Higgins would then suggest that they trade photos — sending each juvenile victim a photo of an unidentified female teen investigators said.

In return Higgins would often receive nude photos that the victims took of themselves according to the prosecutor's office.

Immediately upon receiving those images Bradshaw said that Higgins would take a screenshot of the victim’s visible friends list and threaten to share the boy’s own nude photos unless the victim did exactly what Higgins demanded.

In most of the cases investigated Higgins then demanded that his victims masturbate or perform sexual acts on themselves in a video chat as Higgins recorded according to the prosecutor — even as many of the boys would audibly beg for him to stop taping.

The first case linked to Higgins involved a Pennsylvania boy in Berks County who contacted Snapchat and reported that he sent nude photos of himself to someone he believed to be a teen girl according to the prosecutor's office.

The unknown female who in actuality was Higgins had then threatened to expose his

nude photographs after they exchanged pictures investigators said.

That was followed by a similar report from an underage male in Alabama according to authorities.

Higgins has remained in Burlington County Jail since being arrested at his home in October 2020.

Anyone who believes their child has had inappropriate interaction on Snapchat or Instagram with someone going by the user name of Julie Miller Julia Miller or some variation of that name has been asked to call Burlington County Central Communications at 609- 265-7113 or send an email to tips@co.burlington.nj.us.

AvalonBay Communities (AVB 1.15%) is one of the largest apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the United States. It offers a yield of around 2.9% which isn't huge by REIT standards but is nothing to scoff at considering an S&P 500 Index fund will only get you about half as much yield.

But the real story here is growth. Here's how it is baked into the AvalonBay cake and why a change in market conditions probably won't matter all that much.

Not a yield play

The first thing to know about AvalonBay is that dividend investors in search of high yields should probably look elsewhere. Given the fairly modest yield which sits toward the low side of the stock's historical range the REIT is probably fully valued. This is really more about long-term business growth and the quality of management.

AvalonBay owns apartments with a focus on population-dense regions with good job markets and high barriers to entry. Historically that has meant being in and around large U.S. cities but the REIT is more than happy to go wherever it sees material demand.

Because housing is a basic necessity apartments tend to be fairly resilient over time even though short leases mean that economic fluctuations can have a material near-term impact on performance.

Management likes to make sure it owns highly desirable properties. That means keeping its portfolio fairly young and full of the most modern amenities. This is achieved through active portfolio management with the REIT selling older properties. What it does with the cash that it raises meanwhile is the key to AvalonBay's long-term success.

Redevelop buy or build

Probably the easiest way to make a property more valuable is to upgrade it. AvalonBay has a long history of doing this via redevelopment. That can be as simple as putting in an upgraded kitchen or a new communitywide amenity. These are small investments that allow the REIT to increase rents. Higher rents means higher funds from operations (FFO) and a greater ability to increase dividends.

That said a quicker way to boost the top line is to buy an entire building. With a market cap of roughly $30 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet AvalonBay has ample capacity to acquire apartments. This is a good use of cash too if the company adds newer assets at the right prices. That's important since management doesn't like paying more than it would cost to build a new property.

And that brings us to the last way AvalonBay grows its portfolio: ground-up construction. It has a long history here working closely with local governments to put up new buildings in areas that might require extra effort. Remember that it has a focus on regions with a high barrier to entry where land is likely to cost more regulations are likely to be more intense and the certainty of completing a project is a third key factor. This is the company's focus today and things are going exceptionally well.

For example AvalonBay has five properties in ""lease up"" status which means they were recently completed and are now accepting tenants. Average rents are coming in around 12% higher than expected. That has increased the expected return on these projects by around 50 basis points which seems small but is actually a very big deal.

That said there's a project pipeline of around $4 billion being worked on that should support growth over the next couple of years at least. Not only is AvalonBay putting money into markets where it already has a presence cementing what are already strong regional positions but it is also expanding in up-and-coming areas like Southern Florida Texas and Denver. Given the REIT's history and focus these projects are likely to be well positioned no matter what is happening economically at the time they open.

Multiple levers for growth

Here's the big takeaway: AvalonBay isn't wedded to any particular growth method. If the biggest bang for the buck is redevelopment it will pursue that. If acquisitions are most profitable so be it. If ground-up construction is the best way to grow as it is right now that's what management will focus on.

The REIT's size experience and financial strength allow it to shift with the market around it so it can continue to grow and reward investors no matter what is happening in the economy or on Wall Street.

If you are conservative and want to own one of the best-run apartment REITs AvalonBay should be on your short list. That said it is not particularly cheap today but that's not unusual given its impressive history. Still if you can stomach owning a great company that is fully priced AvalonBay might be worth adding to your portfolio even at current prices.

If you have more of a value focus however it is a name to put on your wish list just in case a major market sell-off leaves it on the sale rack. A yield above about 4% would be quite attractive historically speaking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FwYXJ0bWVudHMtcmVudGFscy1sYW5kbG9yZC1mYWlyZmllbGQtcHJvcGVydGllcy1meGZiMGdiedIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy9hcGFydG1lbnRzLXJlbnRhbHMtbGFuZGxvcmQtZmFpcmZpZWxkLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtZnhmYjBnYnk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apartment owner Fairfield Properties owns one-fifth of all units in rental buildings on LI,"Fairfield Metro at Glen Cove a 367-unit development that records show was purchased last year by Fairfield Properties for $37.8 million.

Few renters on Long Island find an apartment without coming across the name Fairfield Properties. That's because the company based in Melville owns 13260 rental units — or about one-fifth of all units in private apartment buildings in the region according to a Newsday analysis of data from the real estate analytics firm CoStar Group Inc. Fairfield is the biggest apartment owner on the Island and dominates the rental market in several towns CoStar data shows. The company grew out of a single 1973 transaction when members of the Broxmeyer family bought their first apartment building on Long Island executives said. Fueled by a stream of acquisitions the firm has accumulated a portfolio of 175 developments from Cedarhurst to Westhampton. The Long Islanders who now run the business — co-managing partners Gary Broxmeyer and his nephew Michael Broxmeyer and chief financial officer Ralph Cusano — have more than doubled Fairfield’s rental holdings over the past decade public records show. Fairfield spent more than $2.12 billion on properties since 2013 based on prices Newsday reviewed in deeds applications for tax benefits and press releases. Regional business leaders said they welcome the rise of a company they described as a long-term steward of local communities. The trio of Fairfield executives said they're proud to improve homes in their community by offering quality customer service overhauling the outside of properties and renovating the inside of apartments when residents move out. The company leverages its size to get deals on materials and appliances and maximize value for renters they said. The revamped units rent for hundreds of dollars more per month tenants said. Residents in the unrenovated apartments describe more typical rent increases but some fear the upgrades will usher in rates they can’t afford. There is no evidence that rent rates have grown because of Fairfield’s size but firms with such an extensive reach may be able to push up prices and reduce tenants’ ability to negotiate favorable leases economists and housing analysts say. “The consolidation in certain places definitely [is] shocking” said Shane Lee a data scientist at RentHop an apartment listing site based in New York City. “Renters will have less to no negotiating power."" Fairfield executives said they believe the firm's market-share is closer to one-tenth of multifamily residences on the Island — 10% instead of 20%. When asked for data to back up their assessment Fairfield referred Newsday to a firm that said it didn't internally track apartments on Long Island and to a 2016 report that included a broader range of rental units such as completely subsidized developments. Fairfield residents have plenty of alternatives the company executives said.

He and his wife would like to expand their family but that would require moving out of their two-bedroom home in Fairfield Townhouses at Coram.

Paying so much in rent would feel like throwing money away rather than building equity in a home he said. ""Living here there’s no chance of retiring."" — With Kai Teoh

Few renters on Long Island find an apartment without coming across the name Fairfield Properties. That's because the company based in Melville owns 13260 rental units — or about one-fifth of all units in private apartment buildings in the region according to a Newsday analysis of data from the real estate analytics firm CoStar Group Inc.

Fairfield is the biggest apartment owner on the Island and dominates the rental market in several towns CoStar data shows.

The company grew out of a single 1973 transaction when members of the Broxmeyer family bought their first apartment building on Long Island executives said. Fueled by a stream of acquisitions the firm has accumulated a portfolio of 175 developments from Cedarhurst to Westhampton.

The Long Islanders who now run the business — co-managing partners Gary Broxmeyer and his nephew Michael Broxmeyer and chief financial officer Ralph Cusano — have more than doubled Fairfield’s rental holdings over the past decade public records show. Fairfield spent more than $2.12 billion on properties since 2013 based on prices Newsday reviewed in deeds applications for tax benefits and press releases.

Regional business leaders said they welcome the rise of a company they described as a long-term steward of local communities. The trio of Fairfield executives said they're proud to improve homes in their community by offering quality customer service overhauling the outside of properties and renovating the inside of apartments when residents move out. The company leverages its size to get deals on materials and appliances and maximize value for renters they said.

The revamped units rent for hundreds of dollars more per month tenants said. Residents in the unrenovated apartments describe more typical rent increases but some fear the upgrades will usher in rates they can’t afford.

There is no evidence that rent rates have grown because of Fairfield’s size but firms with such an extensive reach may be able to push up prices and reduce tenants’ ability to negotiate favorable leases economists and housing analysts say.

“The consolidation in certain places definitely [is] shocking” said Shane Lee a data scientist at RentHop an apartment listing site based in New York City. “Renters will have less to no negotiating power.""

Fairfield executives said they believe the firm's market-share is closer to one-tenth of multifamily residences on the Island — 10% instead of 20%. When asked for data to back up their assessment Fairfield referred Newsday to a firm that said it didn't internally track apartments on Long Island and to a 2016 report that included a broader range of rental units such as completely subsidized developments.

Fairfield residents have plenty of alternatives the company executives said. Many choose homes with the firm because it has an array of options for people at every stage of life: recent graduates with limited budgets families seeking more space and retirees looking to downsize they said.

""Size is a great benefit” said Michael Broxmeyer part of the third generation of the Broxmeyer family to run the business which also owns 18 office buildings totaling 1.5 million square feet. “Our size certainly is not limiting them in any way.""

Fairfield has grown so large that its signature hunter-green signs are a recognizable part of life on the Island residents say.

“Anybody that’s under 40 years old has gone to look at a Fairfield apartment” said Daniel Lloyd founder and president of Minority Millennials Inc. a nonprofit focused on supporting young people that has highlighted a shortage of affordable rental housing on Long Island. “Fairfield and Jones Beach — you know both if you’re on Long Island.”

They can be hard to find because homeowners don't always advertise on listing sites and many units are intentionally camouflaged from street view researchers and tenants said.

Expansion picks up steam

Fairfield's expansion has accelerated over the past decade according to an analysis Newsday conducted to get more detailed historical data than was available from CoStar. At the end of 2012 Fairfield owned 5165 apartments; that's since shot up to 12770 according to the analysis. These sums — compiled from the latest unit counts on file with local governments — provide a conservative sketch of the firm's holdings since Newsday didn't focus on co-ops and other units that were not publicly claimed by the company and couldn't easily be tied to it through deeds mortgages rental permits and other documents.

Fairfield has long eyed apartments near transit shopping and recreational sites but historically there haven't been many such developments for sale company executives said.

""More properties were built over time and became available"" said Cusano. “There’s really no explanation for it other than that the opportunities were there most recently.""

The firm also grows by designing and building rental units that fill a niche in its portfolio the executives said. They estimate that Fairfield built 10% of its apartments a smaller portion than some other owners in the region business leaders said. The drawn-out approval process has curbed the development side of the business the Fairfield executives said. They noted that Fairfield spent 14 years getting the green light to add 102 apartments to Fairfield Greens at Holbrook.

Top owner in town

Despite these hurdles Fairfield has accumulated far more apartments than other owners in several markets — areas generally based on town boundaries.

The company owns about 39% of apartments in Smithtown and 31% in Brookhaven and the Oyster Bay-Glen Cove area according to CoStar data. The second largest companies in these areas have market-shares that are at least a dozen percentage points behind Fairfield's.

Purchasing to profit

Institutional owners premise purchases on the idea that renovating a property will generate larger profits than owning a building with standard rent increases Lee said. They hit their revenue targets by remodeling apartments.

‘With organizations like the Australian Packaging Covenant (APCO) setting 2025 targets of having 70 percent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted and 50 percent of average recycled content included in the packaging Australian product manufacturers are having to focus on and take steps towards increased sustainability quickly’ said Jack Malki director at Jet Technologies.

‘Encore is a strong first step in the right direction for using plastics within the circular economy and provides a sorely needed path forward for brand owners who are ready to work towards these recyclability and sustainability goals’ added Malki.

Encore is an option suitable for businesses looking to shift away from using plastics and either PLA (corn starch) or wood-based alternatives in their printing and packaging.

At the same time as being produced from 30 percent recycled content the films are also fully recyclable ensuring that product manufacturers can enjoy the functional benefits of plastic films while ensuring that they work entirely within a sustainable circular economy.

‘Jet Technologies acknowledges that it is our responsibility to provide the local market with the very best sustainable options to improve the environment’ said Malki. ‘Introducing new film ranges can be challenging but we are seeing strong and constant demand from brand owners for better solutions in order to meet their environmental pledges.

‘We see this demand as a strong sign that films like Encore will quickly replace less sustainable traditional films. We also expect the percentage of recycled content in these new films to be increased over time as the technology permits it.’

The Encore films are currently BOPP based with PET options also in development. They look and feel like regular films and run on various machinery in a usual way ensuring that businesses do not have to make any adjustments to existing films. Costs are comparable to existing films with a small premium of approximately 15-20 percent being well received by brand owners looking for solutions to meet recyclability targets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As the experts explained for any strategy to be truly effective resources and investment should be channelled towards causes that are genuinely material to the brand in question. Brands must also take a holistic view of their sport for good strategies aligning their investments with broader company objectives relating to environmental social and governance (ESG) factors whilst monitoring their progress against global standards and targets.

There is no denying that establishing a comprehensive strategy takes time commitment and collaboration among internal and external stakeholders but in truth declaring lofty goals is the easy part. What really matters is the subsequent action not the initial statement of intent – and of course being able to prove that sports-focused purpose investments drive tangible growth across the triple bottom line.

So how can brands rationalise their investments? What metrics should they measure and report internally to determine and communicate the success of their sports partnerships? And is it possible to draw a direct link between purpose and profit?

The business benefits of purpose marketing

In business commercial growth and sustainability have often been seen as separate things. Even today many executives view sustainability as too complex or costly to implement while some believe initiatives designed to help organisations become more sustainable simply aren’t profit-generating. Such myths abound particularly in sport where short-term profitability and immediate results are paramount yet a growing number of C-suite decision-makers are beginning to realise how sustainability can create long-term and measurable value for their business.

Whether they are targeted towards environmental responsibility or social impact it is clear that the business benefits of purpose investments are both direct and indirect. Purpose-led marketing and communications can help sharpen a brand’s messaging and ensure it stands out from others in the market. That differentiated positioning not only helps fuel less tangible qualities like brand appeal but it can also raise advocacy scores and ultimately boost sales. Similarly corporate activism while potentially polarising has been proven to drive consumer affinity and loyalty in many instances enabling brands to carve out greater market share.

Research suggests companies with higher ratings for ESG factors financially outperform comparable businesses with lower ones and are far more likely to be viewed more favourably by consumers. As such investors are increasingly taking notice of sustainability-related performance data; according to an EY survey conducted in 2018 90 per cent of global institutional investors revise investments if companies do not at least consider ESG criteria within their business model.

Whatever a company’s values and purpose there are myriad ways to determine the extent to which sustainability contributes to business success. While there is no industry standard framework – objectives differ greatly after all – many brands have developed their own methodologies for measuring its impact on company growth with certain metrics and KPIs identified and monitored as a means of striving towards overarching strategic objectives.

Consumer products giant Unilever for example tracks more traditional performance metrics like social media impressions to determine the success of its purpose-led brand campaigns but it also invests in consumer research to understand how those campaigns affect purchasing decisions and overall brand affinity. That process of information-gathering helps establish causal links between purpose and brand or business performance.

Indeed such research has led Unilever to determine that its sustainable living brands – which it defines as those that ‘integrate sustainability not only into their purpose – in other words their marketing platform – but also into their product’ – grew 50 per cent faster than the rest of its business and delivered more than 60 per cent of the company’s growth in 2016.

Make no apologies for financial motives

Linking the purpose of a business to the future of the planet and its people can help strengthen emotional connections with customers especially if delivered through an authentic and engaging marketing campaign. But simply championing a mission doesn’t pay the bills.

Rationalising purpose investments through financial justification is an imperative for any for-profit business – and not only because doing so satisfies the finance director. Ultimately given effective sustainability strategies should benefit the long-term health of the company and not just the planet no brand marketer should apologise for seeing their investments through the prism of profit.

Even the most virtuous of virtuous cycles must start somewhere. After all the more money a company generates the more it can invest in taking action and supporting good causes further down the line.

Writing in an article published in February shortly after his company’s inclusion in the inaugural Laureus Sport For Good Index last November Ball Corporation president and chief executive Dan Fisher explained that most brands no longer see sports partnerships primarily as a way to sell more products. Consumer demand for more purposeful brands and more eco-friendly products is driving a greater focus on sustainability he noted and sports properties have an important role to play because they harbour ‘the power to be true vehicles for change’.

Ball Corp supplies its products such as infinitely recyclable aluminium cups to sports organisations including the Los Angeles Rams and Climate Pledge Arena helping major teams and venues to meet their sustainability targets. But it is not a charity. Sure its stated aim is to educate and inspire legions of event-goers to be more sustainable in their everyday lives and encourage others not least the teams or brands they support to behave in the same way. Yet that aim is rooted in sound business logic: promoting more sustainable practices will only broaden adoption of the very products Ball Corp produces thereby driving revenue growth and boosting its own bottom line.

Proving the value of purpose investments can be a challenge as some benefits such as an improved reputation among consumers and other stakeholders are indirect. But it is nevertheless an important means of securing internal buy-in from managers who might have other priorities. Quantifying what can be quantified and spending time on rigorous reporting supported by financial data and articulated in the language of business is key in that regard.

In any case while scepticism around sustainability might exist within even the most committed businesses internal resistance can be overcome through incentivisation. A growing number of companies are linking executive pay to ESG metrics with clearly defined targets and KPIs used to track progress. As such any campaign or activation that supports ESG objectives including purpose-led brand partnerships and sport for good initiatives will likely be viewed more favourably when seen in that context.

There is also a case to be made for making sustainability-related incentives a non-negotiable component of any partnerships. Given that sustainability performance is fast becoming an increasingly important consideration within business-to-business relationships brands can offset risk and save money in the short term by building certain performance incentives into their partnership agreements. Doing so ensures clear alignment with the company’s corporate strategy and creates a hook to activate around as the partnership evolves.

As Dan Reading the head of sustainability at Right Formula and one of the judges for this year’s Laureus Sport For Good Index explained in a recent interview with SportsPro: “In this space ‘profit’ can seem like a dirty word. However from a brand perspective we aim to cultivate purpose to drive profit and this is critical to drive investment in this area.”

Uniting sporting purpose with company values

Though 23 years old cloud-based CRM specialist Salesforce only ventured into sports marketing in early 2021. Like many companies its aim is to use its sports investments as a means of educating and building awareness about its brand and product range particularly among business decision-makers but there is also a significant purpose-marketing component within every one of its partnerships.

Stay up to date with the latest sports business news and insights. SIGN UP

“Salesforce from the very beginning was founded as a values-based company” explains Adam Forrest the San Francisco-based firm’s senior vice president of global brand and sports marketing. “From the very beginning we’ve had a 1-1-1 model which means one per cent of profits one per cent of product and one per cent of people’s time are donated back to non-profits to help communities grow and really ingrained in the values Salesforce has which are customer success innovation equality sustainability and trust.”

Today Salesforce’s sports partnership portfolio includes headline deals with Team USA and the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games as well as separate tie-ups with the national Olympic bodies of Great Britain and Germany. It is also in the first season of a five-year global sponsorship agreement with Formula One worth a reported UK£100 million (US$130 million) overall.

As a B2B software provider starting out in sport from scratch Salesforce rationalises its sports marketing investments differently to many B2C brands that tend to measure success by how much revenue they can drive directly through any given partnership. To use Forrest’s words there is no “perfect ROI model” for a company like Salesforce or any company for that matter. While business growth is an important motivation he says the success of its partnerships is determined by tracking things like awareness levels and affinity among existing and prospective customers.

Yet there are other purpose-related considerations too. Salesforce is working with Formula One for instance to help the series achieve its goal of net zero emissions by 2030. At a time when climate change has been cited by chief executives as the top risk to their organisation’s growth the company’s Net Zero Cloud product enables Formula One to constantly monitor its carbon emissions and identify ways of reducing its environmental impact.

Meanwhile as part of its work in the Olympic movement Salesforce is helping athletes to develop skills and build careers after their competitive days are over while it also supports various community initiatives in tandem with its sports partners.

In January for example Salesforce donated US$1 million to The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools as a means of advancing equity in under-resourced schools across the Los Angeles area. That donation was made as part of its support for the legacy objectives of LA28 and specifically its commitment to addressing educational inequity in the host city. It also tied into a broader strategic giving programme that has seen the company donate more than US$145 million in grants to schools and education non-profits across the US to date.

“Everything that we do is grounded in who we are and what we stand for” says Forrest.

Allianz used its sponsorship of Bayern Munich’s women’s team to highlight the ‘All Are United’ initiative

Another major international brand using its sports partnerships to support broader ESG objectives is Allianz which featured among 29 companies in the inaugural Laureus Sport For Good Index. Like Salesforce the German insurer is a significant backer of the Olympic and Paralympic movements thanks to its worldwide partnerships with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) while it also maintains high-profile sponsorship deals in mainstream sports like soccer golf and motorsport.

According to Daniela Bauer the global head of partnerships at Allianz the company’s international partnerships portfolio is based on brand objectives and a strategy which includes sustainability at its core. “We proudly collaborate with our partners to promote our diversity and inclusion” says Bauer. “One such initiative is the ‘All Are United’ campaign with the FC Bayern Women’s team at Allianz Arena.”

That campaign was expanded earlier this year to promote a fundraiser campaign launched by the United Nations to support girls and women fleeing the Ukraine war. Promotional activities centred around FC Bayern’s home match against Paris Saint-Germain in the Uefa Women’s Champions League in March.

“It was the first FC Bayern women’s match to be played in the Allianz Arena – a milestone for us at Allianz being a host and long-term partner of the team” says Bauer. “This special occasion was a perfect start for our campaign. For this historic match and all following games in the Uefa Champions League this year we forfeited our logo on the front of the FC Bayern women player’s jerseys for this important message of ‘All Are United’.”

As Bauer explains Allianz measures the performance of such initiatives in various ways. As well as tracking standard metrics such as exposure reach and engagement on a monthly basis the company conducts an annual return on marketing investment (ROMI) analysis in which it tracks key ROI and ROO indicators. That yearly analysis includes a brand advocacy study designed to measure among other things the social and environmental consciousness reputation potential and actual impact of each partnership.

“We focus on activating around causes that matter to us” says Bauer. “Our latest example is the MoveNow programme where we commit to move people of the next generation across the globe through 24 initiatives in the upcoming months until the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024. We are implementing this purpose-led initiative across our sponsorship portfolio with the aim of getting the next generation moving today – so that they are ready tomorrow.

“One initiative is taking place this month with more than 100 participants from the Young Leaders Forum at the European Championships Munich 2022 taking part in a Hackathon organised by Allianz to create initiatives to get young people back into sport.”

Boston Beer the manufacturer of Truly saw its stock price take off as the hard seltzer trend took hold in 2020. A year later the market clearly was starting to soften and SAM stock did the same.

And now? Second quarter earnings show the category is in big trouble. So does Boston Beer stock which after gaining more than 300% in less than a year now is in the red over the past three years.

AN UGLY QUARTER FOR THE CATEGORY

It was clear at the start of the year that hard seltzer growth was decelerating. What second quarter earnings showed is that the category in fact is declining.

For Truly which trails only privately-owned Mark Anthony Brands’s White Claw in market share volume was down per Seeking Alpha 17% year-over-year. Anheuser-Busch InBev called out strength in a niche vodka seltzer but ignored hard seltzers altogether on its conference call.

Molson Coors appears to be the only winner with its market share climbing two points to 9%.

But Molson Coors clearly is an outlier as evidenced by commentary from two companies that understand the broader trend better than perhaps any other: the manufacturers of the cans that hold the product. In late April Ardagh Metal Packaging SA projected the category would post a growth rate in the mid-high single-digits for the year. Three months later the same company pointed to a well-documented decline in the category and cited hard seltzer weakness as the primary cause of its own disappointing revenue guidance for the year. Larger rival Ball Corporation saw its hard seltzer revenue decline 20% year-over-year.

A STUNNING DISAPPOINTMENT

Part of the problem for manufacturers of both the drinks and the cans is that inventory built ahead of anticipated summertime demand that obviously has not materialized. But the disappointment here extends far beyond a single quarter.

Hard seltzer was supposed to be a game-changer for the entire industry. There were projections that off-premise sales of hard seltzer would quickly exceed those of craft beer in the U.S. according to the University of Vermont. Given market penetration that went from 0% to 10% seemingly overnight (as reported by Forbes). and long-term benefits (notably in terms of calories) that optimism made some sense.

Right now though that optimism is gone. As Boston Beer’s chief executive officer admitted after Q2 hard seltzer is even losing share to the decidedly untrendy category of light beer.

Hard seltzer manufacturers still have some levers to pull to drive a recovery most notably around pricing.

But at this point the most optimistic hopes for the category seem dashed. Hard seltzer looks like it will be a niche part of the alcohol industry in the U.S. That’s not bad considering where it began — but a stunning disappointment considering where so many thought it was going.

The new movie is a direct sequel to the Broly film that was released initially in 2018 and draws focus away from Goku and Vegeta in favor of Gohan and Piccolo. There are new interesting tidbits to get into so let’s break down the ending and where it falls in the overall Dragon Ball canon.

Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Movie Ending Explained

We have new forms! It’s always nice to see beloved characters continue to grow and we see that in Gohan and Piccolo this time. Considering how much of the Dragon Ball Super series has revolved around Goku Vegeta and the tournament of power everyone else stays out of the spotlight for the most part. Now we have the Broly movie canonized the return of the Red Ribbon Army and Gohan and Piccolo leveling up. The most hype moment of the movie is arguably seeing Gohan Beast for the first time.

Potential Unleashed Gohan

Prior to this we see Gohan in his Potential Unleashed form which we first saw back in the Fusion Saga. It took Gohan seeing Piccolo almost dying to push him over the edge to unlock the new form. It makes you wonder if Piccolo planned that as well since he was tricking Gohan with the Pan shenanigans. The whole fight is reminiscent of Gohan and Cell during the Cell games but with Piccolo in place of Goku - obviously not quite a beat-for-beat recreation but it’s a neat remix of one of the series' biggest fights. Either way it’s a very cool moment seeing this new form that looks similar to his Super Saiyan 2 hair albeit significantly longer with a silver tinge with this new form being much more powerful than that.

Next up of course we have Piccolo’s new “Super” Namekian transformation which Piccolo dubs “Orange Piccolo.” Not the most imaginative but also not wrong. Piccolo visited Dende in hopes of further unlocking his potential but suggested using the Dragon Balls instead because of course they can. With Shenron’s help Piccolo unlocked his potential and activated his new form mid-battle. Just before the change you can see the symbol of the Namekian Pride glow on his back. Similar to Gohan this is an upgraded version of his Potential Unleashed form. It’s pretty cool to see the student and teacher both level up in a similar way considering their long-standing relationship over the series. Not to mention seeing Gohan using Special Beam Cannon completely for the first time on his final attack. Such an emotionally charged moment.

Speaking of taking that Special Beam Cannon Cell is back … kinda – in the form of Cell Max. We got new androids and another Cell. Crazy. This Cell is very different though in a lot of ways. First off Cell Max doesn’t seem to have the ability to absorb others which caused a lot of concern back in DBZ as fans remember. Compared to the original Cell Cell Max seems almost feral - in his first three forms Cell was quite chatty and prone to speeches. He just went berserk out the gate. This might be due to him not being perfected but it clearly didn’t affect his fighting abilities - or stunt his growth.

Gamma 1 Dr. Hedo and the Red Ribbon Army

Then we have Dr. Hedo Dr. Gero’s grandson who created the new androids Gamma 1 and 2 plus Cell Max. We find him at the end looking to turn himself in after the chaotic events of the final battle. He really seems to be a good guy compared to his grandfather. His overall goal was to create ‘superheroes’ to stop potential threats to Earth which he was tricked into thinking was led by the Capsule Corporation. WIth that said Bulma invites Dr. Hedo to join Capsule Corporation to better make use of skills. So far we got ex-villains joining the good guys in back to back movies. The bad guy becoming a good guy is after all typical for most villains in the DragonBall universe. We have Cheelai Lemo and Broly in the last movie and now Dr. Hedo and we assume Gamma 1 as well. Even though Gamma 2 sacrificed himself we wouldn’t be surprised to see him again hopefully … although that Avengers: Endgame particle dispersion seemed pretty certain.

Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Post-Credits Scene

Lastly we have a post-credits scene in this movie that shows the finale of Goku and Vegeta’s fight that happened off-screen during Piccolo and Gohan’s adventure. Goku calls it quits giving Vegeta a very rare win as they collapse to the floor. If you told someone the new Dragon Ball movie ends with Vegeta beating Goku this might not be how they’d picture it - but hey it’s a nice bonus for Vegeta fans tired of Goku always coming out on top. Meanwhile Broly had a front row seat for all this so maybe he learned some new tricks. But who knows when we’ll see him in action again - and that’s our biggest question:

The Future of Dragon Ball

What's next for Dragon Ball? The Broly movie cleaned up at the box office and Super Hero looks like it’ll follow suit. Could there be a new series on the horizon or does the future of the series lie in more movies? There are rumors that new Dragon Ball episodes are currently in production set after the Universe Survival Arc reportedly slated for a 2023 return. A new DBS movie set after Super Hero is also reportedly in pre-production with Toei planning to release movies every two to three years. We'll have to wait and see if it all materializes in the future when Toei Animation officially confirms what’s next for the popular anime series.

""Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero"" has finally made its way into North American theaters serving as a followup to ""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" released in 2018. The film takes an unexpected route focusing on characters that have taken a backseat in recent years in the ""Dragon Ball Super"" anime and manga. Specifically it's Piccolo and Gohan who get their time to shine. ""Super Hero"" features the return of one of the oldest ""Dragon Ball"" evil organizations The Red Ribbon Army and two new and deadly superhero androids.

With Goku and Vegeta off-world Piccolo and Gohan need to rise to the occasion to defeat the Red Ribbon Army (again).

The only problem for the duo is that they've not grown much in power since their ""Dragon Ball Z"" days. Gohan specifically had always been touted as the one to carry the mantle of his father as the strongest with characters saying multiple times over the years that he has the potential to surpass even Goku in strength. Unfortunately the time skip in the ""Dragon Ball Super"" anime showed Gohan becoming complacent with his power choosing to be a family man and pursue an education and a job.

""Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero"" seeks to make amends with the two Z fighters pushed to the wayside. Piccolo and Gohan both receive powerups and to celebrate the long overdue power upgrades for the fan favorites we're breaking down how they got them and what it means for the future of ""Dragon Ball Super.""

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

PHOTO: ODT FILES

The national memorial for conscientious objectors is a welcome addition to the steps above George St and Albany St. Since the official opening of the Archibald Baxter Peace Garden on October 29 2021 the site has quickly established itself as an important national and local landmark.

The central feature in the garden is a powerful statue titled We Shall Bend but Not Be Broken created by Arrowtown sculptor Shane Woolridge.

The statue commemorates the mistreatment of Baxter for his refusal to go against his convictions and take up arms in World War 1. An information plaque explains the context and the form of field punishment (known as Field Punishment No 1) which Baxter experienced in Flanders during 1918. Baxter describes the experience in his book We Will Not Cease (1939):

""My hands were taken from round the pole tied together and pulled well up it straining and cramping the muscles and forcing them into an unnatural position ... I was strained so tightly against the post that I was unable to move body or limbs a fraction of an inch.""

For Woolridge to craft such an evocative representation of field punishment that is appropriate to display in a public place is a remarkable achievement. The design invites the onlooker to reflect on what it would be like for someone to be stretched and bent in this way for hours.

Baxter’s son the poet James K. Baxter describes field punishment as a ""torture post"" and it was known colloquially as ""crucifixion"". However the visual image of the memorial — and the inscription which accompanies it — are expressions of human dignity not just pain and suffering.

Baxter is not depicted directly and but his experience is suggested in two different ways.

First the upright pole is constructed from 70 stacked stone discs. These are suggestive of the compressed vertebra disks of a person constrained on the field punishment pole for hours. The message is understated but clear for those who wish to reflect on it.

Archibald Baxter

Second a bronze sphere hanging from the top of the structure recalls the well-known images of Baxter during field punishment especially the painting Field Punishment no 1 by Bob Kerr.

Depicting both field punishment and Baxter himself in this indirect and understated way manages to convey the suffering he experienced without being too overwhelming for a public memorial in a prominent location.

At the opening ceremony Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson spoke on the tragic irony that because Baxter was determined to stand up for his principles he was forced to bend in pain for many hours.

Robertson recognised this as an inspiration for all who call New Zealand their home.

Baxter and the other conscientious objectors exemplify what Robertson described as ""standing upright as a New Zealander"".

Emeritus Prof Kevin Clements has noted the appropriateness of the memorial’s elevated position just above George St. One can look across the harbour to the Fallen Soldier’s memorial (1923) at the crest of the peninsula horizon. The two memorials nearly 100 years apart in age both speak to the courage and the cost paid by those they remember in different ways.

Clements is chairman of the Archibald Baxter Trust and it is the trust which had the vision for this public gift. It undertook the fundraising commissioned the work and liaised with the Dunedin City Council to make it possible.

I first encountered Baxter’s story when I was invited to offer the Archibald Baxter Memorial Trust lecture in 2015. This annual lecture is held each year on or close to International Peace Day September 21. After the lecture my Otago colleague Associate Prof John Stenhouse encouraged and guided my research into Baxter’s religious views. It was a fascinating journey.

In his later years Baxter became Catholic but he is usually described as an atheist because for much of his life he was not a member of a church and did not identify as religious. It is clear that he was not religious in a conventional way but there is also evidence that in some ways he always had a strong personal faith.

When he was categorised as an agnostic in Wellington jail he declared this was wrong. His wife Millicent said that he would insist that he was not a member of a church but said ""I am a believer"". During the lowest point of suffering during field punishment Baxter appears to have derived personal support from religion but he said he did not act for religious reasons.

Because Baxter was so reticent on his beliefs it is hard to know for sure what he made of religion. In the biography of Millicent Baxter Out of the Shadows Penny Griffiths details a revealing story. Archie and Millicent converted to Catholicism in 1965 and Archibald took the baptismal name Francis after Francis of Assisi. However his niece insists that her father (Archie’s brother Donald) never knew about his conversion until his funeral in 1970. Religion was seen as a very private matter.

While the national memorial is not about Baxter’s religious faith— or his presumed lack of religious faith — the sense of restraint it shows with regard to field punishment is very fitting for how Baxter himself viewed public expressions of faith. Under the surface there is much more than is first apparent.

They were released into the Babanango Game Reserve earlier this month.

Both males arrived from the Western Cape in May.

For the first time in about two centuries cheetahs have been released into the Babanango wilderness in KwaZulu-Natal.



""The cheetah release means a lot for the establishment of [the] Babanango Game Reserve. As we know that cheetahs are scarce in the world releasing new individuals and expanding cheetah conservation areas means more of this species on the continent"" said Musa Mbatha Babanango's reserve manager.

The return of cheetahs was part of the newly established reserve's rewilding process Mbatha added.

""We are making history in returning these majestic cats. The dream of rewilding Babanango is slowly getting fulfilled every day.""

The two males were released into the 19 000-hectare property in a conservation milestone for the species and reserve.

It was the first time in approximately 200 years that this iconic predator would have roamed the spectacular landscape of Babanango an area steeped in historic significance and nestled in the heart of KwaZulu-Natal Mbatha said.

The young males brothers from the Roam Private Game Reserve in the Western Cape arrived in May. They were held in the Babanango boma for a few weeks for the pre-release phase and monitoring.

Their release into the game reserve went smoothly under the guidance of veterinarian Ryan van der Venter and Mbatha.

Babanango's chief operations officer Andrew Baxter said they hoped to house even more wildlife in the future.

""Cheetahs now roam and hunt freely among the valley of the kings after an absence of some 200 years. More iconic species such as elephants lions and black rhino are on their way.""

Baxter thanked the local community for their contribution to the reserve.

He said ""We salute our many partners - our neighbouring communities who have invested their precious land our visionary benefactors for their bold commitments our dedicated and professional staff who see the bigger picture.""

Both cheetahs were fitted with tracking collars to assist in post-release monitoring in their new landscape with their movements tracked daily.

Two days after their release they successfully hunted an adult hartebeest.

Cheetahs are listed as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and therefore it is crucial for the growth of their population genetic diversity and importantly the protection of natural habitat for them to thrive.

We developed a multiscale imaging framework that comprehends acquisition pre-processing automated tracking segmentation with further feature extraction as well as visualization dedicated for 3D live imaging (Fig. 1a). In this work we applied our framework to live intestinal organoid light-sheet recordings performed with a dual-illumination inverted light-sheet6 microscope which utilizes a multi-positioning sample holder system (Fig. 1b). In order to image organoid development we followed previously published protocols6 FACS sorting single cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a) from mature organoids and mounting them as 5 uL mix drops with Matrigel on top of a ca. 50 um thick fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) foil which are then covered in medium (Fig. 1c left and Methods Section). To stabilize the imaging we patterned the FEP foil used for mounting in order to create small wells (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d Supplementary Note 1) allowing better control of the sample position within the holder while improving reproducibility of experiments by preventing drops from being washed away during medium change of fixation procedures. As previously demonstrated the microscope we utilized is capable of imaging live intestinal organoids for long periods of time68 as well as acquiring time-lapses of mouse embryonic and gastruloid development1819. However one important drawback of the system was that the alignment of the illumination beams is done only once prior to the experiment and irrespective of the position of the sample in the dish or holder. Although sufficient in certain situations (e.g. mouse embryo imaging) imaging of samples embedded and distributed inside a gel suffer from refractive index mismatch between water and Matrigel as well as from the presence of other obstacles in the light-path (other organoids or debris) and from the curved shape of the sample holder itself. Therefore to improve recording conditions in every individual sample we developed a position dependent illumination alignment step. This allows to fine tune the alignment of each of the illumination sheets in respect to the detection plane for every sample position so that best image quality possible can be achieved throughout (Fig. 1b right and Supplementary Note 1).

To minimize storage needs and improve SNR acquired images are cropped using a dedicated tool that automatically corrects for 3D sample drifting (Fig. 1d upper row). The cropped images may also be further pre-processed through denoising and deconvolution steps. Denoising is performed using the Noise2Void scheme20 with its output sent to a tensor-flow based image deconvolution21 (Fig. 1d lower row) using measured PSFs from beads (Supplementary Note 2 and Methods Section).

With these first modules at hand we imaged organoids expressing Histone 2B and mem9 membrane peptide tagged with mCherry and GFP respectively recording the growth and development of several organoids starting from single cells or 4-cell spheres (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Movie 1) every 10 min throughout the course of around 4 days. The collected data comprised of organoids that form both budding and enterocyst phenotypes: whereas budding organoids grow from single cells into mature organoids with both crypt and villus structures enterocysts comprised of terminally differentiated enterocytes do not have crypts as they do not develop Paneth cells required for the establishment of the stem cell niche a necessary step for crypt formation68.

For the analysis we initially performed single-cell partial semi-automatic tracking using the Fiji plugin Mastodon (https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon) on seven datasets. After that we extracted features based on organoid and single cell segmentation and plotted this data over time (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1). For example we noticed large variability in cell division synchronicity as in some datasets the nuclei number growth over time loses the typical staircase-like behavior already early during the first day of recording. Although epithelium volume growth curves follow that of nuclei number with the characteristic exponential behavior nuclei density slightly increases over time. Mean cell volume showed characteristic mitotic peaks with overall cell volume decrease over time matching the increase in nuclei density. Interestingly although initially cell to nuclei volume ratio vary all datasets converge to common steady state values where the cell volume is ca. 3–4 times larger than the nuclear volume. We also observed a consistent change in organoid volume due to medium change during the live recordings (Supplementary Fig. 2). As this initial assessment of our imaging data showed consistent and reproducible results and to handle larger dataset more rapidly and consistently we developed an integrated and automated approach to turn the imaging into digital organoids with a visualization tool.

Dedicated image processing workflow

To make the entire analysis and visualization tools directly accessible we incorporated all image processing and data analysis modules into a unified workflow named LSTree having most processing and training steps implemented using Luigi-based tasks and the rest as jupyter notebooks for cropping and segmentation evaluation. The workflow along with juypter notebook and two example datasets are provided as a documented Github repository with step-by-step guide (see Methods Section and Supplementary Notes 2–4 for more information).

In the first pre-processing step the user selects which organoid needs to be cropped. This automatically generates minimal bounding boxes per time-point as well as global bounding box (Fig. 2a). The workflow also has an interactive tool to review the crops and perform few manual corrections e.g. to account for large displacement between consecutive frames (Supplementary Fig. 3). Next if needed denoising and deconvolution of cropped and registered movies is performed as one combined step. Important to note that we chose to denoise and deconvolved our datasets as the image quality usually decays quite heavily at later timepoints. However this is not a requirement and the prediction models can also be trained based on good quality unprocessed datasets. More details on how to bypass the denoising and deconvolution steps are discussed through the example datasets provided in the GitHub documentation.

Fig. 2: Cropping segmentation and tree-prediction strategies underlying LSTree. a Cropping of datasets is done in a semi-automatic way: selected object of interest is fitted with an orange (best fit for each particular timepoint) and a global red bounding boxes which can be corrected in 3D. b Nuclei and cell segmentation strategies. Upper row: denoised and deconvolved input data together with seeds from respective tracking are used as input into the network to predict nuclei volume. The network is trained with both complete and partial annotations. Lower row: Cell volume prediction follows similar input as for nuclei. Main difference is that this second network is trained with supervision of complete manual annotations of lumen and organoid along with the previously done nuclei predictions themselves. c Strategy for prediction of lineage trees. Track predictions are done with each consecutive pair of frames. Each pair of frames enter the neural network and produce both the timepoint in question and a linking frame which is used to connect to the next timepoint via overlap match. Linking itself is done via joint segmentation. d Example of predicted and corrected tree from a budding organoid dataset with the recording starting from two cells (recording 006). Full size image

For the segmentation of organoids as well as their cells and nuclei we adopted different segmentation strategies all relying on existing convolutional neural networks (Fig. 2b). Our main initial motivation was to test whether we could incorporate the spatial information from the lineage trees spots for training segmentation models. To that end we decided to use the RDCNet instance segmentation network as a base22 taking advantage of its inherent recursive architecture. First nuclei are segmented in 3D following a deep learning model trained with a mix of complete and partial annotations. A small subset of the frames is fully annotated by manually expanding the labels to the full nuclei whereas partial annotations rely on the initial tracking performed with Mastodon by drawing spheres at the position of tracked nuclei. (Fig. 2b upper row). Jupyter notebooks for interactive visualization and correction of the predicted segmentation are also part of the framework and added onto the GitHub which allows improving the model accuracy with minimal annotating time. To check whether this approach was valid we compared the trained network output with randomly selected hand-annotated image volumes yielding very good results (see Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4a b).

Motivated by the initial results with nuclei segmentation based on sparse annotations we took a similar approach for cell segmentation. To this end organoid and cell segmentation also use RDCNet and leverages the pre-computed nuclei segmentation to avoid manual annotations of individual cells. At the same time we added a constraint based on lumen and epithelium segmentation to avoid that cell labels spread outside of the epithelial layer. To subdivide the epithelium mask into cells the previously segmented nuclei are used as partial cell annotations under the assumption that they are randomly distributed within the cell compartment (Fig. 2b lower row Supplementary Note 3). Finally in addition to the segmentation volumes and nuclei number (Fig. 1e) several different features are extracted such as nuclear distance to apical/basal membranes fluorescence intensity distance to parent node and number of neighbors per cell (For a complete list of features with short explanations see Supplementary Table 2).

Deep learning model for automated lineage tracing

Although suitable for estimating lineage trees for few datasets semi-automated tracking of many datasets with the Mastodon Fiji plugin can be time consuming as different datasets may require different setting parameters often break when cells are too packed or with low signal-to-noise. To significantly improve this process we trained and refined a deep learning model on the available tracked datasets aiming at automatic generation of candidate trees that only require minimal corrections (Fig. 2c d Supplementary Note 3). To avoid usage of tracing algorithms that enforce a complex set of rules232425 we developed a joint segmentation-tracking approach that simultaneously predicts matching nuclei labels on 2 consecutive frames. To this end we extended the RDCNet instance segmentation model to predict pseudo 4D labels (3D convolutional network with time axis as an additional image channels) mapping correspondences between nuclei in two consecutive frames (Fig. 2c). Predicting linked nuclei segmentations has the advantage to enforce constancy over the entire nuclear volume rather than relying on an ambiguous center as well as implicitly enforcing rules such as minimum cell distance or plausible nuclei volume constraints in a data-driven manner. This method keeps the number of manual hyper-parameters tuning to a minimum and can be improved over time as more validated and corrected datasets are incorporated in the training set. In a complementary manner this method can be used together with other deep learning strategies such as Elephant in a complementary and modular manner in which curated trees via Elephant can be used for training of more generalized tracking models based on RDCNet or even directly used for nuclei/cell segmentation training/prediction.

To assemble the predicted tree in the framework nuclei labels in each frame are connected to their parents in the previous frame by finding the linking label with the maximum overlap (Fig. 2c Supplementary Fig. 5 and evaluation for dataset 006 in Supplementary Table 3). The predicted tree is then saved with the structure of a MaMuT.xml track file which can be then imported into Mastodon for further correction if necessary (Fig. 2d). As a direct consequence of the joint segmentation additional information such as the nuclei volume can be overlaid on the predicted trees to aid in the curation process (Supplementary Fig. 5 Supplementary Note 3). For instance jumps in nuclear volume highlight positions where tracks should be merged or split. The manual curation time ranges from minutes to a couple hours on the most challenging datasets (e.g. low SNR images abnormal nuclei shape). In summary the here developed lineage tree-prediction approach allows high quality prediction of intestinal organoid lineage trees with long tracks spanning multiple division cycles (up to five generations in this work) enabling tracked data to cross spatiotemporal scales. To further challenge our tracking prediction strategy we have also tested it outside of our main focus on live imaging of intestinal organoid and used trained models to validate prediction accuracy on mouse embryo datasets from published work (Supplementary Fig. 4c e Supplementary Table 4 and discussions on Supplementary Note 5) also comparing it to output from trained Elephant Tracker models (all trained models can be found in the Supplementary Software).

Digital organoid viewer

With the lineage trees and the deep learning 4D segmentation of organoid lumen cells and nuclei at hand we developed a multiscale digital organoid viewer to explore and perform in-depth data mining. The viewer combines both lineage trees and segmented meshes facilitating the direct comparison of different features within a multiscale digital organoid framework. We have added it to our LSTree Github repository along with example data also including the possibility to overlay recorded images with the corresponding meshes allowing a direct inspection of the predicted segmentation (Fig. 3a Supplementary Movie 2). As can be seen through the example datasets present in the repository this interactive viewer allows associated features to be displayed selected nodes to be interactively highlighted on the meshes and color coding of both trees and meshes to be assigned independently. This way same or complementary features can be visualized at once (All currently extracted features are discussed in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 3)

Fig. 3: Digital Organoid Viewer. a Digital organoid viewer is a web-based tool that shows both lineage trees (left) and respective segmented nuclei and cell meshes (right) simultaneously. Color coding of of each data representation can be done in a combined or complementary manner. Here depicted is a color coding based on generation 2 with each of the four cells acquiring different colors being propagated further in time. b Overlay of the nuclei segmentation as predicted in onto the lineage tree. c Overlay of distance to basal membrane onto the lineage tree. d Visualization of the calculated meshes from nuclei and cell segmentations overlaying the corresponding values (with corresponding color map) of the features presented in (b and c).

As an example of the image-analysis and visualization tools presented in the framework nuclear volume quantifications can be evaluated directly onto the tree of a specific dataset (Fig. 3b). Using this approach it is possible to observe and quantify how much nuclei volumes change with each generation and over time with the smallest volumes observed right after division. Similarly we observe that the nuclear distance to the basal membrane (Fig. 3c) increases due to interkinetic nuclear migration toward the apical side. Combining the same visualization procedure with the segmented meshes we render the nuclei or cells in 3D using the same color-coding as for feature on the trees (Fig. 3d). Last but not least we also compare the extracted features against the general trend from all other datasets combined allowing us a direct evaluation of variability across experiments (Fig. 3e f) evaluating the increased distancing of nuclei from the apical membrane a known effect due to epithelial polarization (Fig. 3f).

In summary this is a broad set of tools embedded under the same workflow which allows not only multiscale segmentation of organoids along with lineage tree predictions but also the simultaneous visualization of both trees and segmented meshes into a unified web-viewer. All steps of the process are implemented to keep storage memory and manual tuning requirements to a minimum making this a powerful and yet easily accessible part of the light-sheet framework.

Functional imaging through fixation and backtracking

Next we analyzed functional information on the tracked cells and organoids contained in the lineage trees. Although our imaging framework allows the visualization and quantification of a large number of features at the cellular and organoid levels throughout organoid growth functional information remains dependent on fluorescent reporter organoid lines. The easiest way to theoretically approach this is to perform stable multicolor live imaging for long periods of time. However overlapping emission/excitation spectra limits the total number of fluorescent reporters and concerns regarding interference with the normal cell function signal-to-noise sensitivity for low abundant proteins photostability and general phototoxicity due to laser illumination limit the use of fluorescent reporters. To overcome this we fixed and added an immunolabelling steps at the end of the live recordings to assess the end state of the cells. Then we tracked the immunolabelled cells back through the lineage tree (Fig. 4a) using LSTree for further visualization and analysis.

Fig. 4: Fixation and backtracking after live-imaging. a Fixation and backtracking strategy for light-sheet imaging of organoid growth (shown recording 007). b After fixation a registration step may be needed to overlap the fixed nuclei with the nuclei as shown in the last timepoint of the timelapse. Left: midplane of raw data from last time-point H2B-mCherry recording (cyan) against same plane after fixation (red). Center: registration maps the fixed volume into the last time-point volume. Although overlap is not perfect it is sufficient to maps each nucleus back.

In details we fixed the sample at the end of the recording with 4% PFA to then perform the immunolabelling protocol (see Methods Section). The pre-patterning of the FEP foil holding the sample was crucial as without it the Matrigel drops were washed out. To account for organoid drifts we imaged the entire fixation procedure so that the organoids could be tracked during fixation leading to a recovery of more than 80% (for more detailed information please see Supplementary Note 6). To register the fixed organoids to the last time-point of the live recording we used similarity transformations implemented in ITK and available via Elastix2627 (used as a stand-alone tool as exemplified in Fig. 4b. For more information please refer to the Methods Section and Supplementary Note 6). To test this approach we imaged H2B-mCherry mem9-GFP organoids until day 3 (Supplementary Movie 3 left). It has been shown that between around day 1.5 intestinal organoids break symmetry through the appearance of the first differentiated cells of the secretory lineage (Paneth cells Lysozyme). Preceding the appearance of Paneth cells there is the local establishment of a Notch-Delta lateral inhibition event with future Paneth cells being typically Delta Like Ligand 1 positive (DLL1+)6. To analyze symmetry breaking we fixed the organoids at 56 h and stained for DLL1-Alexa488 and Lys-Alexa647 (Fig. 4c–e- Supplementary Movie 3 right). Intriguingly the two DLL1+ cells are two sister cells that were formed at the end of the division from generation 5 to generation 6 around 10 h before fixation.

To follow cellular dynamics and changes of features of these specific cells in their spatial environment we analyzed nuclei and cell volumes (extracted with LSTree) per generation of the backtracked cells from generation 5 and 6 and compared them to all the other cells during the same generations (Fig. 4f). Interestingly cellular and nuclear volumes of the backtracked cells do not seem to deviate relative to each other during generation 5. After cell division and entering generation 6 however the nuclei volumes of both DLL1+ sister cells show an increased relative difference to one another with the Lys+ cell having a slightly larger nucleus. Changes in nuclear volume related to appearance of DLL1+ signal was also observed in other datasets (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Next we evaluated the dynamics of neighbor exchange by cross-checking the closest cells to a backtracked cell(s) of interest at each time-point with LSTree. We examined if the progeny of these two sister cells had high level of mixing with other cells during cyst growth. From the visualization of the tracked neighbors on the lineage tree and segmented meshes (Fig. 4g) it is apparent that neighbor exchanges although distributed across the tree do not happen often nor with many different cells keeping an average of five cells.

The above results show that by combining our light-sheet framework with standard fixation and registration techniques we can broaden the level of functional information bridging it to the dynamical processes during live imaging. Consequently we were capable of dissecting some initial dynamical elements preceding the formation of DLL1+ and Paneth cells in the context of the entire organoid development analyzing the process of symmetry-breaking events across biological scales.

Nuclei merging events during organoid growth

From our backtracking example it became apparent that one cell undergoes multiple rounds of failed divisions with two daughter cells merging before a new division starts (Fig. 5a). Upon further inspection of the other lineage trees we realized that most of the datasets contained at least one merging event during early phase of organoid growth whereby two sister nuclei at the end of their cell cycle divided again into two instead of into four nuclei (Supplementary Fig. 7). To investigate whether a failed division during the previous mitotic cycle was causing these nuclei merging we examined the last step of the previous cell division. In all cases there was a problem during late cytokinesis with the two sister cells never fully separating (Fig. 5a b). Nuclear volume for all the daughters arising after the merging event is clearly increased and cell volume followed the same behavior roughly doubling in tetraploid cells (Fig. 5c d). To dismiss the possibility that these mitotic failures are caused by phototoxic effects of the imaging itself we performed a time-course experiment with wild-type organoids grown from single cells under same medium conditions as the live recordings. We fixed organoids at days 2 and 3 staining them for e-Cadherin and DAPI. Despite the lack of continuous illumination the resulting data showed many cysts with polynucleated cells as well as cells with enlarged nuclei (Fig. 5e).

Cyan arrows mark the position of a connecting region between the two nuclei until the following division occurs where cytokinesis is successful.

Using the framework we were able to follow the fate of the progeny of a cell that underwent cytokinesis failure and surprisingly we noticed that they can lead to cells that remain part of the epithelium until the end of the recordings without dying when we can observe fully budded organoids or mature enterocysts (end of day 4) (Fig. 5f g). Yet comparing to unaffected parts of the trees this binucleation progeny typically has higher probability to be extruded into the lumen (~46% for merged progeny against ~5% for other cells). Another intriguing observation is that the remaining 54% of the cells are never localized to the crypt but to the villus (Fig. 5f Supplementary Fig. 8). This is an interesting result as it suggests that the cells that undergo cytokinesis failure and might have chromosomal defect do not migrate or differentiate into niche cells (Stem cells and Paneth cells) but stay as villus cells that are shorter lived. This might mean that there are mechanisms to maintain cellular integrity in the stem cell niche avoiding damaged cells in the crypt.

Molecularly it is known that the Large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (Lats1) can influence cytokinesis failure via lack of inhibition of Lim kinase 1 (Limk1)282930. This poses an interesting hypothesis on the role of mitotic failure in intestinal regeneration as Lats1 and Yap1 are master regulators of regenerative response of the intestinal epithelium3132. Analysis of RNAseq from previous studies6 show decrease in Lats1 expression during initial days of organoid growth that mimic the regenerative response of the intestinal epithelium6. This regenerative response is achieved by downregulating Lats1 as a negative regulator of Yap1. We initially stained for Limk1 and could see cell-to-cell variability of its expression (Supplementary Fig. 9ab). To further analyze the role of Lats1 and Limk1 in the regulation of cytokinesis failure in the early days of organoid formation we perturbed Lats1 and Limk1 activity. Time-course imaging of Lats1 double knockouts6 showed several cysts with double nucleated cells that result from mitotic failures (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Moreover inhibition of Lats1 and Limk1 with chemical inhibitors (Truli and Damnacanthal see Methods Section and Supplementary Fig. 9) increased and decreased the number of bi-nucleated cells respectively (Fig. 5h i). Lats1 inhibition also display an increase of Yap1 activation. This shows that in intestinal organoids formation cytokinesis failure is regulated by Lats1 activity that in turn is a negative regulator of Limk1.

Taken together through the multiscale approach of 3D segmentation feature extraction and lineage tree analysis we were able to identify consistent polyploidy events during early intestinal organoid development and the fate of their progeny. Our framework allowed us to bridge the observed mitotic defects across scales toward the tissue scale showing the end fate of the merged cells progeny and spatially locating them onto the mature organoid morphology. This is shedding new light on the robustness of a regenerative YAP cellular state questioning the role of polyploidy in intestinal regeneration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbmVyZWouY29tL2JyZWFrdGhyb3VnaC1wcm9wcy1jb21tZW5jZXMtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLW9mLTQtc3Rvcnktb25lLWNhbmFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakthrough Props. commences construction of 4-story One Canal,"East Cambridge MA Breakthrough Properties a leading global developer of life sciences real estate backed by a joint venture of Tishman Speyer and Bellco Capital has commenced construction on the redevelopment of One Canal by Breakthrough a four-story lab and office building.

Jenny Rooke: Where we fit into the venture ecosystem and the world needs yet another early stage venture firm is an important question. Genoa is here to serve and support the companies that are innovating at that convergence of biology and technology and what we observed throughout our years of building and investing in such companies is that they tend to fall between the cracks in the traditional venture landscape or ecosystem. You have the world of life sciences investing; often those investors have come up through healthcare professions they're very focused on human healthcare on therapeutics and we know the venture model works there. And then you've got technology and deep technology investors who are generally very comfortable with building and operating companies and scaling but may not have any exposure to biology or healthcare. And so you get a company that is incredibly exciting because it is bigger than the sum of the parts by combining the latest innovations in life sciences and tech in terms of data science deep tech materials semiconductors optics just really looking across all these disciplines but the venture ecosystem is not particularly multidisciplinary it's very siloed. I love those companies my whole team loves those companies that's who we want to help achieve their full potential because we think they’re some of the most transformative companies and innovations out there and they're the most underserved at the earliest stages of venture where to underwrite those kinds of risks you need to have both the deep life sciences training to understand the science and technology being applied but also an appetite for building scalable businesses as opposed to assets moving through the clinic. So that's where we sit at that biology meets technology convergence being built really bottoms up to focus on those kinds of companies.

VN: The intersection of life sciences and technology can you give me some examples of what that means? What verticals are you investing in? How does that work exactly that intersection?

JR: We see the kinds of applications for those innovations in a few different themes. One is technology driving biology; this tends to be your tools and diagnostics type companies. How instruments consumables and now data science are applied to understanding the mysteries of living systems cracking that mystery of biology that we still have there's still lots to learn there. That can be in the lab it can be pure research or more an applied setting like in patient care picking a great therapeutic for example or monitoring disease.

Increasingly part of what really inspired me to do this work from a position of a new firm as opposed to trying to invest in tools and diagnostics like a traditional healthcare fund is we've got this other theme which is biology as a technology itself. We live in a post-CRISPR world where the ability to engineer molecules and even living systems is increasingly coming online. And so the ability to apply design and engineering principles to biology to solve problems is increasingly true. These kinds of companies that are either creating those tools or using those tools to make solutions is a really interesting category. And then the third category really overlays all of that for the theme which is applying all of this outside of healthcare; we see companies in the agrifood space and industrial bio even in consumer that are using these principles of technology and biology to solve problems that are not about patient care as important as that is but may be about putting the next putting food on people's tables or providing energy in a way that is more efficient or bringing consumer’s valuable products that they may not have otherwise. That was a gap in the marketplace to think of biology is something other than healthcare

VN: Do you do purely B2B do you do any B2C? It sounds like you also do B2B2C.

JR: We let the entrepreneurs tell us where they think the opportunity is and what the right business model is but you're quite right that in general it looks like either B2B or occasionally B2BC. So it's a company selling analytical instruments to pharma biotech for example or to research labs. It's companies selling diagnostics into the healthcare system; that's a complex sale across payers clinicians and patients so I suppose it's B2B2C2P. One of our Fund II investments is called Stemson and they are using stem cell technology so biology as technology to generate hair for the hair replacement space. That is definitely consumer oriented but it's not an on the shelf product.

VN: What about something like an Everlywell for example and at home diagnostics? We're seeing more companies like that pop up in the last few years. Is that something maybe you would invest in?

JR: I love how you're contesting the bounds of the thesis. Potentially is the answer; what we have found as a barrier to investing in direct to consumer or B2C solutions is so far in general the innovation there the real breakthrough tends not to be science-based. We are a science-based investor we're investing in translating scientific technology into products that's what we really understand as a team and a lot of what's happening in bringing interesting healthcare solutions to the consumer is more about channel and marketing and cost reduction and things like that which is exciting and I'm happy to be a customer of some of that but it doesn't really focus on this need that we're meeting in the marketplace and this set of skill that our team has which is really rooted in the science.

VN: How would you define the macro trend you’re betting on?

JR: Many people are talking about the “bio revolution” or the “century of biology.” If the 20th century was about semiconductors and computers the 21st is about biology. I mean that's the big trend that we think this is the century when just the explosive innovation in our ability to understand and engineer biology will transform everything. And that's again not limited to human healthcare.

An undercurrent in all of that is that is that crossover or interdisciplinary idea we were talking about which is practitioners and innovators and entrepreneurs from other walks of life getting excited about that bio revolution and bringing their frameworks mindsets perspectives and best practices from these other worlds. That's where we're getting such an exciting melting pot of innovation.

VN: I know that you just recently closed your second fund so what's the size of that fund? How many investments do you make in a typical year?

JR: Fund II is $84 million; that's a 2021 fund. We just announced it but it's a last year fund so we're about halfway through the investment period. We right size our funds to be able to lead or co-lead the first round so we're mostly investing in seed and A focusing on that science to product journey. Our bottom up portfolio construction means that with a fund of that size we will invest in about 15 companies writing first checks of $1 to $2 million for a seed $2 to $5 million for an A and then heavily reserving for the capital journeys; as we know these companies take a long time to get there. So in any given year we might invest in on average five companies in this fund.

VN: There's obviously a big difference between seed and series A in terms of where the company will be at that point. I'm assuming for the seed companies there really wouldn't be traction at that point; maybe there wouldn't be numbers that you're looking for. But maybe in Series A there would be. Is that accurate? And if so what do you want to see from those companies to want to invest?

JR: Actually the word “traction” typically does not enter into our vocabulary for the investments that we're making. These companies are pre-product and so at seed there is generally proof of concept for the underlying science and technology; at A there's often what we might call a prototype. We know what the product is but they're still in that stage of science and technology risk that needs to prove product market fit. The lines between seed and A have been blurring and particularly so for companies in this category; these are not B2B SaaS companies where you've got really clear definitions around what they need to be. A helpful metric that not many people know is the technology readiness level metric that the government uses when DARPA or NIH is funding technology development. So these are TRL 3 and beyond companies are not pure concepts there is data that supports the idea of what they want to do but they definitely don't have a product on the market. That's what Genoa is here to do to help them get that on market and prove that product market fit.

VN: It’s interesting that you said they’re pre-product even at A. Is that just because with life sciences especially it's just a longer life cycle? Because you have a consumer app and the expectation now is that even by seed you're going to have not just the product you're also gonna have customers and traction and all that stuff. But healthcare and life sciences especially just take longer it's just harder to get off the ground.

JR: That's right yeah. If you think about an instrument company like a next gen DNA sequencer for example the seed round might be just around some experiments to show that the chemistry works. The A round may be to build a prototype of the instrument and get some customer interaction usually in the form of beta testing and the B round might be to actually get to product launch and early traction.

VN: If there's not a product one of the other things that venture capitalists especially in the early stages will look at is the market. So how do you determine that there is a market for this product? How do you determine that it's a product that is going to have customers once it actually launches?

JR: It's a super important question for being so early and being so science-based. When we look across our 14 categories of risk we're almost always taking high risk on science and technology and the long term capital journey. And so we have a pretty high bar around market risk. Unlike in tech where you might say “well let's just build the thing and see if we can prove out a market” we don't do that we don't invest in technology and hope there's a market. I have seen newer investors to biotech take that approach misapply that approach from tech to this world and it's a great way to waste a lot of money over a long time period because as you observed these are long cycles. So you can spend tens of millions of dollars making a thing and then find out there's not a market for it and then you can't pivot you can't iterate because it does take so long. So we look for hyper clarity and conviction from the team and we look to get that conviction ourselves about the market opportunity in the specific market customer customers need value proposition that the company's looking to address.

VN: What's the diligence process there? How do you determine that?

JR: I should mention that on the general Genoa team there's 10 of us and all of us are scientists by training so we’re bringing that deep expertise. We're also operators so we've all been company builders in these various spaces. In some cases we know these markets very well; we've sold or failed to sell products into these markets and we know how they work and what buying cycles are like what price points are like value props and all of that good stuff where we have a lot of familiarity. In some cases in these more emerging spaces like agtech and industrial bio it's a little less clear; they're not as well trodden as other venture spaces and so it's very very important to do diligence with those customers to have partners who really know those areas. When we're investing in these other verticals we love to build syndicates whenever we invest and in those in particular we will look to co-invest with specialty funds who really know those markets and those customers.

VN: You briefly mentioned the team in your previous answer. When I first started doing this column I would ask the question “what's the most important thing?” and almost every single VC I spoke to said “the team.” Especially at the early stages and you're talking about pre-product the team is really really important for you at that point. So what are you looking for from that entrepreneur and team? What do you want to see that makes you want to invest in them?

JR: I want to talk about that but I also want to talk about the way this question gets asked. “What's the most important thing?” as if you could pick one thing and then let everything else slide up. That's not how we invest. It's like “do you have kids? What's more important that they have arms or legs? Are you buying a home? What's more important having bedrooms or bathrooms?” It has to have both to meet the need. So is team essential? Yes and we'll talk about what that means for us. The technology has to work the market has to be there the intellectual property situation has to be attractive there has to be a financing path. We have a list of criteria and it doesn't make sense to us to say one is more important than the other because they are all essential. We won't let one slide because another one is really strong.

VN: That makes a lot of sense. It’s all got to work together.

JR: Yeah that's right. When we're looking at a team you've heard all of the answers about what one looks for: about passion and conviction and all of the general things so let me focus on the specifics for what we do: we prioritize experience more than your typical early stage venture investor and there are several reasons for that. One is the complexity of building these sorts of companies that do have all of these elements of science and market and intellectual property and often regulatory; it is very hard to learn that on the fly. And so those who bring the wins and the scars from having operated in these spaces before can really cut through a lot of that. Early stage companies startups on a seed round have to get things done very quickly on very scarce resources so they don't really have time to figure it out as they go; they need to be really focused they need to be really efficient and they need to not really have any ego about it. And so we love mid-career professionals who know a market know a set of customers know what they need that thing we were talking about before the “how there's going to be a market?” They have an insight into that market based on their own experience and want to apply science and technology to it. That's a great blend we find.

VN: How important is it that they've started a company before? Will you invest in first time founders or do you want people who at least have somebody on that team who has that experience? Even if it's not the CEO just somebody in the founding team who has been through this before and knows what they're doing.

JR: Most of our founders are first time founders first time CEOs so we do really take bets on people. That being said they're usually not straight out of school either so they have spent five to 10 years could be in another startup could be in one of the leading companies in their space could be in multiple leading companies in their space where they've really seen what it takes to run a great business in the market they want to serve and they have an idea for how to do it better.

VN: Let's talk a bit about valuations. It's a really interesting question right now because digital health especially over the last couple of years we all saw the pandemic boom. Telemedicine and digital health and all that stuff really rose very very quickly because that was the only way people could really get access to care and that's really come down in the last six months especially for the companies on the public market. So I'm wondering if that's what you've seen also in your space? Was there that boom and has that come down? And how is that changing the way you invest?

JR: That's an important question and I do appreciate the distinction because we're not a digital health investor so we definitely didn't really have any exposure to that telehealth push. In parallel though and long before COVID the last eight or so years we have seen more and more investors and more and more entrepreneurs getting excited about this bio revolution. And so that's meant more companies more visibility and a lot more capital from other kinds of investors traditional tech and generalist investors later stage investors going earlier. So there has been quite a lot of upward pressure on valuations particularly mid and late stage when some of that early risk has been retired. As well as if you look at the rise of early stage emerging managers there's been a lot of seed capital as well people are quite rightly excited about these kinds of companies. So a lot of capital. And then if you combine that with the last few years of public market appetites for bio-based companies the M&A activity it's all just been very strong. And so yes lots of valuation pressure upward.

It tends to be like I said mid and later stage Series B and beyond; it has tended to be in very specific themes. So you mentioned digital health and telehealth and that’s one. Clean meat has been another one AI/ML based drug discovery though that's more like five years old now. Those are hype cycles that happen when the investor community gets excited about a theme but it neglects the much broader opportunity space. It's been a not bad time to be an early stage investor to be honest because here we are sitting at the very beginning trying to solve the problem of being an institutional quality lead at the earliest stages setting valuations in such a way that sets companies up for a successful journey keeping in mind historical valuations at each step of that journey. I think we’ve been though time will tell quite disciplined with our own valuation setting when we're leading and valuations we’ll sign up for when we're joining rounds to keep those historical numbers in mind and not so much the recent 18 months. As a concrete example in our returns model which we do for investments the set of comparables that we use for thinking about multiples we just have not added in data from the last 18 months. We have tried to not incorporate the very recent spike and correction into our early stage discipline approach.

VN: It sounds like what you're seeing is that life sciences and the space that you invest in were not really affected as much over the last couple of years. Am I understanding that correctly?

JR: Sorry I must have used too many words if I left you with that impression. No quite the opposite: if you look at a year ago what most people will call life sciences which is mostly therapeutics the number of preclinical companies that went public at extraordinary valuations was unprecedented. At the peak which was Q1 or Q2 of last year we passed on companies that we considered too early for us because they had insufficient proof of concept data around their science and they went public and got SPACed some of those. So we saw this huge discontinuity in later stage private and public markets being willing to take enormous science risk at very high valuations that we believe is not supported by historic risk evaluation trends. So absolutely it was affected and we tried not to let it get us all wound up. It was probably a much harder time to be a Series B investor where you're in the midst of all of that valuation discontinuity whereas here we are personally at the very beginning of all that watching it happen later.

VN: So what does that mean for the companies especially the ones that raised during that period where the valuations were really inflated? Now they're deflating and they've got to go raise their next round it might be a down round as a result. What do you think is going to happen? Is that already happening? Are you seeing that? And what do you think that's going to mean for them?

JR: We're already seeing that that's always challenging and it's a tough place to be as a company and as investors trying to support a company because you have the temptation the draw of taking that big valuation. That feels good it's good for numbers but again if you're thinking about the long term success of the company you have to take into account every stage of the capital journey and what's going to come next. In our own portfolio we really tried to resist that when we saw numbers that just do not make sense to us for some of our companies and fortunately we were able to partner with them to get good outcomes there. But yes we're definitely seeing both public companies that are now trading way below their IPO prices in life sciences as well as private companies that are going to have to figure out how they're going to catch up to some of those valuations.

VN: Let's talk about your differentiation as a firm starting with your LPs. What's your pitch to your limited partners when you go to them and you say ‘I'm a life sciences firm here's why I'm different from every other firm that you're looking at. Here's why I should deploy your capital”?

JR: One of the benefits of being formed to fill a gap in the venture landscape is what we are doing is unique and that is not my word that is what we've heard from our LPs pretty consistently. They've looked and no one is operating at this true convergence of biology and technology at the earliest stages leading those first rounds and bringing venture best practices including the valuation discipline you were just talking about. So we are different. We're different from those where life sciences firms and not a therapeutic experiment; we do no therapeutics investing. We are also different in how we do it: like I mentioned everybody on the investing team has an advanced degree in the sciences we also all have been operators and so we're really bringing a level of depth of expertise and empathy if not wisdom of experience to those first few steps of a startups journey. And that blend is pretty specialized in the marketplace.

So it's really clear LPs are excited about what's happening in this bio century and bio revolution they want exposure to that. Many LPS who have not invested in biotech in the past because of the binary risk associated with therapeutics because of the regulatory risk find what Genoa is doing is an interesting onramp in the world of bio because it is bio-based products. And so they are accustomed to what it means to invest in venture backed companies that are bringing products to market and trying to scale over time. It's a set of business models and dynamics and frankly metrics and milestones that are a little more comfortable than phase one phase two phase three FDA.

VN: What about your differentiation to entrepreneurs? Especially these days the best companies have a lot of different options for where they can take capital. What's your pitch to the founders to say “here's why I'm a good partner for you”?

JR: I’ll first point to that combination of science expertise and operator experience. And so when great science-based founding teams walk into the room they find people who relate to them and that they can relate to and that happens in a couple of ways. One they start talking about their science and they don't have to use metaphors they can just literally tell us what's happening what experiments they've done what data they've got and we get excited about that with them. And so getting excited about the innovation core of these companies is something we offer and that founders appreciate. And then that operator piece where we've walked the road we've been in their shoes we know we're not in their shoes; it's very important to know that it's not our company it's the management teams who are putting their lives on the line every day and are going to be living this journey. We're there to support them. We know how hard that is and so we hopefully can provide some hard won wisdom that helps them on the journey be more successful more efficient but also some empathy in the travails.

VN: I'm sure that they get very excited talking to somebody who understands what they're talking about and then having to dumb it down.

JR: There's often this moment where founders are pitching us and they've clearly done a lot of pitches by now and they're keeping it high level because that's what someone told them to do. And we ask some questions behind the science and they give the answer and we ask the next level down and we keep double clicking and there's a moment when they realize “they get it I can tell them I can draw it on the whiteboard” and their shoulders relax and their eyes light up and it's just really fun. That's a great moment for us all.

VN: Talk about some of those companies maybe two or three of them that you've invested in and tell me what it was about those companies when they initially pitched you that made you want to invest.

JR: One is called into Intabio it was a company that was bought now a couple of years ago by SCIEX. They are an analytical instruments company they make instruments that people in the lab can use to accelerate their development of new drugs and they do that by more rapidly getting more information about the biology into that drug developer's hands. It's a recurring theme for us we're looking for those tools again that help us crack the mysteries of biology. So that was the first thing that was appealing: a new approach to using things like microfluidics and data analysis to understand biology. We're constantly looking for those better microscopes. The founders were really compelling; they were both again experienced mid-career professionals that had worked together before. The founding CTO and innovator had been in customer-facing roles in one of the leading companies in the industry so knew what customers needed but also happened to be an engineer so we knew he could innovate toward what customers needed. Then his founding CEO partner had the business development skills to really focus the company around a business model and operating plan to bring that innovation into product and get it to market with customers in a very efficient way. So we loved the solution we loved the clarity about the market needs and we loved the focus of the business plan to really prove out the product market fit with pharma and biotech customers.

Another one that's also in that more classic biomedical world of life sciences is our company InterVenn which is applying the science of glycoproteomics to diagnostics discovery and development. We talked about tools and diagnostics it's still that same new technology used to understand the mysteries of biology but in this case translating that into the clinic and into patient care. We love the novel science component of it where we think there's going to be better information that's going to lead to precision medicine. We also love the team which brings skills from genomics from AI/ML from the tech world building businesses at scale and their ability to bring all those different pieces together to do something truly different with a novel take on biology. They're doing quite well there's a lot of visibility about them.

Then the story wouldn't be complete if we didn't mention something from these non-healthcare areas so I'll mention Meiogenix which is a company that operates in this post-CRISPR era to accelerate the development of new crops with better traits and more efficiency. The way they're doing that is if CRISPR lets us edit specific spots in the genome Meiogenix is allowing wholesale rearrangement of genomes to bring all of those edits together. So it's a little bit like getting to cut and paste from a bunch of different documents rather than going into just the one and editing so you can really put together a magnum opus in the form of a crop with better nutrition better growth characteristics more attractiveness to both consumers and farmers.

VN: Let's learn about you. Tell me a little bit about your story and your background. What was it that got you into VC? It sounds like you were an entrepreneur and working in startups so how did you make that transition to being a venture capitalist?

JR: I'm a scientist by training my undergraduate was in physics and software engineering then I fell in love with genetics my PhD is in genetics. Then I went through a process of figuring out where to apply that expertise. I moved into the business world and worked my way toward a startup in the Boston area that was developing new ways to look at the genome. That was perfect that very early stage 10 person how do we get products to market? And so that combination of business strategy but taking into account the underlying capabilities and limitations of whatever the technology was. I loved doing that raised over $100 million in capital for that company through both venture and non dilutive got it to about 100 people and products on market. I wanted to do it again and was looking for the next iteration of that and someone recommended that I consider venture capital. I didn't know what venture was despite having raised a fair bit of capital so I went and talked to our investors and asked them “what do you do every day when you're not funding our company and sitting in our boardroom?” What really appealed to me was the opportunity to learn through looking at hundreds and hundreds of companies what makes a great science-based startup. Rather than learning that in serial every five years doing a new company try to parallelize some of that learning almost like a case-based education in high growth science-based startups. So that was the real draw and then what kept me there and since brought me back there was some winding was my excitement about this category of companies which are again biology meets technology and super early not particularly well served by that more traditional life sciences based venture world.

VN: Since making that transition to being a venture capitalist what are some of the things that you've learned? Let's say that somebody was coming to you and they said like you did “I want to become a venture capitalist.” What's the advice that you would give them?

JR: One surprising lesson which cuts both ways is that venture capital is a finance job. So we are thrilled about the science honored to support founders and ultimately our job is very simple: through all of that it’s to with our LP’s money buy partial ownership in companies and ultimately sell that ownership for hopefully 10x more. That is our job. So what I tell people is if that doesn’t also interest you find some other way. Work with startups write about them there are great ways to be involved but to be a venture capitalist you have to care about that financial performance. It doesn't mean you have to know it is going in but you have to be curious and want to learn it and want to be excellent at it because you don't get to keep playing this game if you don't want to win it.

VN: What's the part of the job that you really love the most when you go to work every day? What motivates you to be a venture capitalist?

JR: There's three favorite moments: there's that period when we're meeting an extraordinary founder or founding team and they're explaining their underlying science and technology and we get to really dig in and understand it and the science just still excites me so much. Whether that's looking at the data reading published papers looking at their grant applications I just love digging into these innovations with the great minds that are driving them.

I love talking to customers love talking to the researchers in the lab who are going to get to use this instrument and are going to learn more about their biology the clinicians who are going to get an answer from a test and be able to deliver more patient care. That's really exciting to me that clarity of what problem we're solving and for whom.

Then the last part I love more and more is the team we have at Genoa: it's a really special group of people who are bringing their science their curiosity their respect for each other and for founders into the room. It makes for a really delightful day to day work experience and also makes me really proud in how we take our job as stewards of this ecosystem really seriously and try to bring that to every founder we interact with.

VN: Is there anything else that you want people to know about you or about Genoa or the space?

JR: You didn't ask about the name. So our philosophy of our role in the ecosystem is embedded in the name Genoa Ventures. The genoa is a type of sail that goes on a sailboat a larger version of the jib and the reason for that choice in naming it Genoa I wanted to be really clear about what I think venture’s role is in the ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship and company founding and building which is just a clarity that it's not our ship. We're not the captains we're very excited to support the incredible adventures that are the founders and innovators on their journey but we know it's their ship and their journey and we're here to help them get there faster. It's a little bit of extra power. The genoa is not for every sailor; it's a lot of power it's a lot of trouble to use. In most cases you can get there just fine without it so there's also some humility embedded in that as well. Most companies don't need and shouldn't raise venture capital. That's something we encourage people to really think about like “do you want to be on the journey with VCs? Because we can be terrible.” But if it's what you need to get where you want to go faster and with that extra skills involved then we'd love to be a part of the journey.

VN: That's fascinating. You really put a lot of thought into the name it seems like much more than other firms that I've spoken to. There's a lot of metaphors in that: the sails are your power but you also don't need it.

JR: I was investing a deal at a time solo before I founded Genoa for about four years I could have kept on doing that; certainly there's a lot of benefits to that it's very nimble. But I really wanted to build a firm that would be bigger than me that would address this need in the marketplace and would be the kind of partner that these founders deserve. That definitely takes a team and takes a firm and all of the tools in the toolkit of venture. And so in thinking about how to set that up I wanted to make sure we picked something that would outlast me. It was bigger than like “I love genetics.” There's other parts of biology I don't know as well that my partners do so it needed to be bigger than just what I was excited about but really about what we're here for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQzNzA1LTAyMi0wMDE0Ni160gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Particle-associated bacteria differentially influence the aggregation of the marine diatom Minutocellus polymorphus ...,"Our results support the hypothesis that the marine nano-diatom Minutocellus polymorphus forms fast-sinking (up to 485 m d−1) aggregates within a matrix of TEP. The sinking rates of these aggregates were comparable to those formed by bloom-forming diatom genera that aggregate readily in laboratory conditions and are associated with events of high POC flux such as Chaetoceros spp. Navicula spp. and Skeletonema spp. with sinking rates ranging between ca. 100 and 400 m d−1 (17 36 37). Our findings support that cell aggregation is the likely mechanism leading to the observations of nano- and pico-sized diatoms such as M. polymorphus in sediment traps deployed in the Sargasso Sea [5 10] and in the Mediterranean [8].

Despite the lower abundance of cells in roller tanks compared to other aggregation studies (103 in our lower cell abundance experiments vs. up to 106 cells mL−1; 20 363738) M. polymorphus formed visible sinking aggregates. As aggregation is highly dependent on the number of surrounding particles and the probability with which they adhere after collision (stickiness; α) [13] a likely explanation for the formation of aggregates despite relatively low particle numbers is the high α of M. polymorphus due to the production of TEP. Cell volume-normalized TEP concentrations in M. polymorphus cultures were two times higher than in cultures of other diatom species known to readily produce TEP and sticky particulate mucus [15] (Table S1). These diatoms are known to contribute appreciably to phytoplankton blooms and therefore contribute to events of high POC flux [39 40]. Likewise M. polymorphus bloom at cell abundances of up to 103 cells mL−1 and predominate in sediment trap material relative to the populations in the euphotic zone [5 10] the latter possibly being a result of the formation of TEP-rich yet fast-sinking aggregates as seen in our study. The sinking rates for M. polymorphus aggregates shown herein would allow for cells within aggregates to escape grazing and remineralization through the microbial loop in the water column contrary to the common assertion that they are entirely remineralized because of their small size and low sinking rates. In nature the formation of TEP-rich sticky aggregates by M. polymorphus would likely scavenge additional ballasting material such as biogenic or lithogenic minerals [41] further enhancing the sinking velocities of their aggregates.

We also found that the aggregation and TEP production of M. polymorphus is differentially enhanced by the species of bacteria present. V. thalassae and P. carrageenovora were pre-selected based on indicator species analyses [42 43] performed on 16S rRNA libraries of bacterial communities on sinking aggregates collected from the mesopelagic of the Sargasso Sea whereby Vibrio spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp. were specific to sinking particles [10]. A third species Marinobacter adhaerens HP15 [26 44] was selected based on their propensity to attach to and enhance the aggregation of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii [19]. When co-cultured with M. polymorphus M. adhaerens HP15 caused a significant increase in the formation of suspended micro-aggregates (5–60 µm; Table 2) and of sinking aggregates (Fig. 4; Tables 3 and 4) similar to its enhancement of aggregation in the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii found by Gärdes et al. [19]. However co-cultures with M. adhaerens did not produce more TEP than axenic treatments in contrast with the increase of TEP in co-cultures with T. weissflogii as reported by Gärdes et al. [45]. It is possible that TEP and/or its precursors were simultaneously being consumed and exuded by M. adhaerens—ultimately leading to a pool of bacteria-derived exopolymeric substances and/or TEP that are stickier than those derived from the diatoms [464748] and to the observed enhanced formation of suspended micro-aggregates without increased TEP concentrations (Fig. 1c d; Table 2). Elucidating the compositional differences of exopolymeric substances and investigating the production of other exopolymers that could also play a role in aggregation would help explain the mechanisms for the aggregation observed between M. polymorphus and M. adhaerens. Contrastingly the addition of P. carrageenovora (a member of the Gammaproteobacteria) did not lead to enhanced aggregation in roller tanks (Fig. 4; Table 3) but to an enhanced volume concentration of suspended micro-aggregates (Fig. 2d Table 2) along with lower cell-normalized TEP concentrations compared to axenic diatom cultures (Table 2). Members of the Gammaproteobacteria are able to hydrolyze complex polysaccharides [49]. Specifically Pseudoalteromonas spp. readily attach to [50] and degrade a wide-range of phytoplankton-derived polysaccharides including the relatively-recalcitrant fucose-containing sulphated polysaccharides [51 52] by utilizing many different carbohydrate-active enzymes [51]. Therefore M. polymorphus-derived TEP was likely being consumed by P. carrageenovora which is also supported by the decrease in TEP concentrations that occurred parallel to increases in P. carrageenovora cell abundances (Fig. 2b e). As known colonizers and degraders of marine particles and phytoplankton-derived organic matter [51 53 54] the greater volume concentration of suspended micro-aggregates in P. carrageenovora treatments during the stationary and decline phases of the co-cultured M. polymorphus (Table 2) may be a result of aggregation of P. carrageenovora cells around free TEP and/or around M. polymorphus aggregates in order to consume the diatom-derived TEP (Figs. 2d and 3h). Lastly no enhanced aggregation was observed with the addition of V. thalassae to M. polymorphus in roller tanks or cultures; however TEP was significantly higher coinciding with an increase in bacterial abundances. V. thalassae may have produced TEP or enhanced the production of TEP by M. polymorphus within co-cultures but the lack of increased suspended micro-aggregates indicates a decoupling with TEP production. This finding also suggests other mechanisms of bacteria-mediated aggregation besides influencing TEP production and/or modifying its precursors as was found with M. adhaerens. These results show that various TEP and aggregation-influencing interactions may occur within a natural bacterial community. In the environment these interactions would be more complex as a result of interactions between diverse bacterial and phytoplankton communities their grazers as well as the influence of nutrient availability and other environmental factors [45] on these interactions.

Cell biovolume-normalized TEP concentrations of M. polymorphus cultures were an order of magnitude lower than those of Synechococcus sp. as found by Cruz and Neuer [20] (Table S1). Despite these lower TEP concentrations M. polymorphus formed sinking aggregates in roller tanks in contrast to Synechococcus which do not form aggregates in axenic conditions unless lithogenic material is added [20]. One possible explanation for this is M. polymorphus’ larger effective size due to the formation of long chains in contrast to the unicellular lifestyle of Synechococcus. The presence of larger particles with higher excess densities within M. polymorphus roller tanks allow for greater collision rates and thus facilitate aggregation. The greater aggregation in M. polymorphus is also seen in cultures whereby suspended micro-aggregate volume concentrations were approximately five times higher (39 ± 19 × 106 µm3 mL−1 in axenic cultures during the exponential phase) than in Synechococcus [20] (7.6 ± 0.41 × 106 µm3 mL−1 in axenic cultures) likely due to the presence of aggregated diatom chains (Fig. 3). Additionally TEP produced by M. polymorphus may be stickier [47 48] than Synechococcus-derived TEP further increasing the chances of aggregation of M. polymorphus chains.

An alternative mechanism explaining the presence of M. polymorphus in 18S rRNA datasets from large size-fractionated seawater [9 55] and sediment trap samples [5 10] is their endosymbiotic affiliation with foraminifera (usually > 100 µm) [56]. Foraminifera are common components of sinking material collected within sediment traps and are therefore significant contributors to particle fluxes [57 58] as their large size and CaCO 3 -derived shells allow for high sinking rates. The assimilation of M. polymorphus as endosymbionts by foraminifera could serve as a mechanism transporting them to depth similar to the export of Phaeocystis spp. as endosymbionts of Acantharia [59] and the diazotrophic cyanobacteria Richelia spp. as endosymbionts of rhizosolenid diatoms [40]. Additionally it is possible that aggregation as seen in our study allows for M. polymorphus cells and chains to become readily available as prey for zooplankton with subsequent export in the form of fecal pellets [60 61]. Nevertheless our observations give further evidence to the underestimation of the contribution of these diatom genera to particle fluxes.

Our study is the first to show the potential for nano-sized eukaryotic phytoplankton to form sinking aggregates and produce TEP and provides evidence that this aggregation is differentially influenced by the ambient bacterial community. We also show that bacteria-mediated aggregation of phytoplankton is likely influenced by other exudates other than the TEP which calls for the investigation of other potential aggregation-enhancing organic compounds. Our results contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by which eukaryotic pico- and nanophytoplankton escape remineralization in the euphotic zone and are exported to the deep ocean.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzA5MDAwL3ZhbHVlLWJhc2VkLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtdG8tYXNzaXN0LXRoZS1pbnN1bGluLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRldmljZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Value-Based Healthcare To Assist The Insulin Delivery Device Market,"Value-Based Healthcare To Assist The Insulin Delivery Device Market

Warren Buffett at a press conference during the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders Meeting on April 30 2022. CNBC

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Friday received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum . Shares of Occidental jumped 10% on the news to close at $71.29 apiece pushing their 2022 gains to more than 145%. On July 11 Berkshire filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy more of the oil company's common stock in secondary market transactions. The conglomerate argued that a maximum 50% stake wouldn't hurt competition or diminish regulatory authority. Carlos Clay acting director of division of electric power regulation granted the permission Friday saying authorization was ""consistent with the public interest."" The conglomerate has already increased its Occidental stake drastically this year. Berkshire currently owns 188.5 million shares of Occidental equal to a 20.2% position. It surpassed a key threshold where Berkshire could record some of the oil company's earnings with its own potentially adding billions of dollars in profit.

Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion or $59.62 each. The warrants were obtained as part of the company's 2019 deal that helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko. The stake would rise to nearly 27% if Berkshire exercises those warrants. Acquiring the whole company? Friday's news fueled speculation that Buffett will be interested in acquiring the whole company eventually after ramping up his stake at low prices. ""He will likely continue to buy as much as he can get below $70 or $75. If you own 30% or 40% and would like to buy it out at $95 or $100 you saved a lot of money"" said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder.

Warren Buffett became one of the world's wealthiest people by transforming Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile mill into a massive conglomerate over the past 57 years. Jimmy McGill the fictional protagonist of ""Better Call Saul"" imagined getting rich by simply being one of Buffett's first shareholders during the television series' finale this week.

In a flashback McGill and another character are shown transporting $7 million through the desert and discussing whether they should take the money and run. McGill also known as Saul Goodman outlines what he would do with his share of the cash if he had a time machine.

""Heh it's easy"" he says. ""May 10 1965. That's the day Warren Buffett took over at Berkshire Hathaway. I figure got $1 million left from building the time machine so I'd take my half and just stick it into Berkshire and then I come back here and I'm a billionaire.""

Berkshire was worth about $19 a share in 1965 according to ""The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway"" by Adam Mead. If McGill invested his $500000 at that price he would receive around 26300 of Berkshire's Class A shares.

Those shares change hands at nearly $457000 each today valuing McGill's stake at $12 billion. A net worth of that size would put him in the top 160 on the Bloomberg Billionaires List between the financiers Steve Cohen and Robert Smith.

Berkshire's ""A"" shares have skyrocketed by about 2400000% since 1965 or a compound annual growth rate of around 19% - nearly double the S&P 500's return over the same period. In other words $1000 invested in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth $24 million today.

Buffett undoubtedly enjoyed his shout-out on ""Better Call Saul"" given it's a spin-off of one of his favorite series ""Breaking Bad.""

""When Vince Gilligan is in charge a show is a cinch to be five stars"" he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015 referring to the creator of both series.

The investor and his business partner Charlie Munger have filmed several skits with ""Breaking Bad"" protagonists Walter White and Jesse Pinkman which they've played for the crowds at Berkshire's annual meetings in recent years.

After buying Berkshire Buffett acquired scores of businesses including See's Candies and Geico and built huge stakes in public companies such as Apple and Coca-Cola creating a conglomerate valued at around $670 billion today. However the 91-year-old deeply regrets purchasing the original textile business.

""I would have been better off if I'd never heard of Berkshire Hathaway"" he told Alice Schroeder in an interview for ""The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life."" He compared the company to a ""soggy cigar butt"" he found on the street.

Still McGill would be fabulously wealthy today if he had owned a piece of Berkshire for nearly six decades. After all that's exactly how Buffett made his fortune.

(Published 2022),"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway on Friday received authorization from federal energy regulators to acquire up to 50 percent of Occidental Petroleum one of country’s largest oil and natural gas producers.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in its order authorizing the partial acquisition that Berkshire said in its July request that the share purchase “would not have an adverse effect” on utility rates and would not hurt competition.

This month Berkshire disclosed that it had already accumulated more than 20 percent of Occidental’s shares. Shares of the oil company which is based in Houston had already risen more than 100 percent this year and climbed an additional 9 percent after the commission released its order on Friday.

Eric Moses a spokesman for Occidental said the commission’s approval was needed because the oil company owns assets regulated by the commission. He declined to comment on Occidental’s and Berkshire’s plans and discussions."

“Technology is an integral part of any business and is especially relevant in sports” said Ann Miller a Twins spokesperson. “Teens who dream of a career in sports — or tech — will be introduced to a whole new avenue to realize these goals.”

The teens’ trip to the ballpark is part of an ongoing partnership between Best Buy and the Twins to engage the community and provide educational and career-preparedness opportunities to youth. The Best Buy Teen Tech Center program enables hands-on access to the latest technology in local afterschool spaces along with mentorship and opportunities for real-world experiences.

As part of the game-day visit to the ballpark the teens learned:

How the Twins’ Baseball Operations Department uses technology to measure and evaluate player performance.

How the Game Presentation group creates digital videoboard content to engage fans at Target Field.

How the Sales Department uses tech to interact with clients.

About the many other behind-the-scenes jobs that help create memorable game day experiences and enhances every part of the organization.

Most of those jobs didn’t exist even a decade ago. “The future in this field is limitless!” Ann said.

On and off the field

Jayden a member of the Best Buy Teen Tech Center at CLUES in St. Paul was impressed with the event. “I didn’t realize how much technology was in baseball but when it comes to scouting and judging players I thought it was cool to see how big of a role it plays” she said.

Before the game teens toured Target field participated in a panel discussion with Twins employees and got to meet TC Bear the mascot. The game began with one of the teens throwing out the first pitch and throughout the game teens spent time in the sound and videoboard control rooms and played music created by Teen Tech Center youth. They even led the seventh inning stretch.

Julieta also from CLUES was glad to hear that many people within the Twins didn’t have professional sports background. “I liked how they are open to bringing in a lot of people even high school students. They aren’t so much focused on your degree — they just want to bring in people who have a passion for programming and technology.”

Sumaya who goes to the Best Buy Teen Tech Center at Hope Community in Minneapolis was blown away by the whole experience especially pregame. “I was very excited and nervous to throw out the first pitch!” she said. “The program today was very inspirational and it was great to see how the Twins are opening up opportunities for all ages.”

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.

Though the weather outside is great for running sometimes you want to work out in the comfort of your own home. It can be pretty pricey to turn a room in your house into a gym luckily we found a way to do it for less. The Schwinn IC4 exercise bike is such a fantastic fitness tool and it's now available for an incredible discount at Best Buy.

As part of its Deals of the Day the tech retailer is offering this workout wonder for $699.99. Typically listed for $999.99 this souped-up cycler is now available for $300 off—that's a 30% discount! Not only do you get the bike a pair of three-pound dumbbells dual water bottle holders and an integrated media rack but you'll also get a one-year membership to the JRNY fitness app (typically $149) totally free.

We named the Schwinn IC4 our best ""basic"" bike in our tests on exercise bikes which basically just means its ""compromise"" is a small LCD screen instead of a built-in tablet. Other connected bikes like Peloton feature tablets. Still the Schwinn IC4 is hardly bare-bones. It has a solid sturdy build (you can pay extra to have it assembled but it is easy enough to put it together) and it comes with a wearable Bluetooth-enabled heart-rate monitor. Its handlebars and seat are adjustable and the frame is suitable for anyone weighing up to 330 pounds. The pedals are dual-sided—you can slide into cages on one side or clip in with SPD-cleat cycle shoes.

The Bluetooth-enabled bike also has a rack to hold a smartphone or tablet so many Schwinn IC4 riders use it as a Peloton dupe. You don't see as many stats or get to participate in Peloton's famed leaderboard but you can download the Peloton app and connect it with the bike to see your cadence appear on the app's screen. This allows you to take part in the Peloton experience at a much lower price—the standalone app costs just $12.99 a month not $39.99 like the version that accompanies Peloton equipment. And if you aren't a Peloton person you're certainly not limited to that particular riding method. The Schwinn IC4 also works with Aaptiv Apple Fitness Zwift and more.

All told this bike is a great value on any day so this bargain price is a bonus. If you're looking to pedal at home without shelling out a ton of cash it doesn't get much better than the Schwinn IC4—so make sure to snag it now before it goes back to full price.

With the recent price hike meaning the 128GB version now starts at $399.99 instead of $299.99 finding VR headset deals on the Meta Quest 2 has become a little tougher… but not impossible.

Thankfully Best Buy has a very solid option that’ll net you the device for $349.99 – if you don’t mind purchasing a “renewed” (refurbished) product.

Meta Quest 2 - was $399.99 now $349.99 at Best Buy Get the Meta Quest 2 renewed for $349.99 and get three months of YouTube Premium thrown in too.

For the price you get arguably the most comprehensive VR headset in terms of ecosystem as well as a pair of Quest controllers. Despite the price hike we'd still rank the Quest 2 as one of the best VR headsets out there.

The Meta Quest 2 is an all-in-one VR system meaning you don’t need to connect it to a games console as with PlayStation VR or a PC like you do with the Valve Index. Instead users can fill up the 128GB onboard storage with apps and games purchased directly on the headset and there are some iconic titles available like the excellent Beat Saber.

Setup is simple but if you do happen to have a PC you can even hook the Quest 2 up for even more demanding titles like Half-Life: Alyx.

Sweetening the deal further is the addition of three months of YouTube Premium. For the uninitiated this $9.99 per month subscription allows for ad-free YouTube binging downloading videos to watch away from a Wi-Fi or cellular connection and ad-free YouTube Music Premium access. It works anywhere you can watch YouTube including on the Meta Quest 2’s own YouTube app.

We should preface this guide by saying that the best investment car to buy is the one you want to own: most successful collectors of anything – art wine watches cars – say the wisest object to buy is one you love: that way if its value goes down rather than up you will have enjoyed owning something regardless of its financial performance.

We should also caveat this piece by saying that there is absolutely no guarantee any or all of the cars in this list won’t lose money over time: the car market as seen recently can be unpredictable and the jury is very much out on what the forthcoming ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars will do to the used sector.

With all that said here are 10 cars that have the potential to make a good investment particularly if you buy them because you love them.

Lotus Elise S1 BMW M3 E92 Audi R8Mk1 Mercedes SL R129 Renault Avantime Toyota GR Yaris Alpine A110 Porsche 911 997 Vauxhall Monaro Honda Integra Type R

1. Lotus Elise S1 (1996-2001)

1.8-litre four-cylinder petrol 120hp

0-60mph 6.1 seconds

Top speed 126mph

One of the best-handling cars ever made the original Lotus Elise featured a pioneering extruded and bonded aluminium structure that both kept its weight well below 800kg and taught the rest of the car industry how to build cars from aluminium.

The Elise offered a near-telepathic connection to the road while also being a masterclass in packaging and ergonomics – don’t think just because you’re tall you won’t fit in either.

Prices start at around £16000 but consider getting any potential purchase inspected by a specialist as that aluminium tub can be very difficult to repair following damage.

2. BMW M3 E92 (2007-2013)

4.0-litre V8 420hp

0-62mph 4.6 seconds

Top speed 155mph

There are six generations of BMW M3 to pick from so why the one model without BMW’s famed straight-six engine? Well being the only V8 M3 marks the E92 out as something a bit different while prices remain on the right side of reasonable for now and you can choose between coupe convertible or saloon formats.

High-mileage examples start at around £15000 but the M3 needs fastidious maintenance; budget more than this and get a car with full service history either from BMW itself or a respected M car specialist. Plus make sure all fluids and service items have been attended to at the correct time.

3. Audi R8 Mk1 (2006-2014)

4.2 V8 420hp

0-62mph 4.6 seconds

Top speed 187mph

The original Audi R8 was that rare thing: a genuine supercar you could use every day. Power came from a 4.2-litre V8 and later a 5.0-litre V10 while there was also a Spyder convertible (which is tight for taller drivers).

We’d opt for the original iteration which means a 4.2-litre coupe with a manual gearbox – not only because it’s relative rarity compared to automatics but also because the gated manual shifter is a joy to use and adds to the R8’s character.

You’ll need £36000 plus to get behind the wheel of a manual V8 R8 and as with any performance car be ruthless when interrogating its condition and history and consider an independent inspection.

4. Mercedes SL R129 (1989-2000)

5.0-litre V8 320hp

0-62mph 6.5 seconds

Top speed 155mph

The R129 Mercedes SL is the archetypal overengineered Mercedes from the late 20th century and remains modern enough to be driven every day with no hardship and a great deal of comfort.

A soft-top grand tourer in the classic form engines range from a 2.8-litre straight six to the extremely rare 7.3-litre V12 of the SL 73 AMG but the 5.0-litre V8 SL 500 is arguably the pick of the bunch. The detachable metal hardtop and optional rear seats are extras worth looking out for while decent-condition reasonable mileage SL500s start at around £20000.

5. Renault Avantime (2001-2003)

3.0-litre V6 210hp

0-60mph 9.2 seconds

Top speed 134mph

The Avantime was a huge sales disappointment for Renault but this luxury coupe based on the Espace people carrier offers character and rarity in spades. Fewer than 9000 Avantimes were produced worldwide yet Avantime enthusiasts are a dedicated bunch so there’s likely to always be a market for the cars.

There are two engines to pick but the 3.0-litre V6 with an automatic gearbox arguably suits the Avantime’s character better than the 2.0-litre turbocharged four cylinder. So sit back in the captain’s chair style driving seat hit the single button that opens all four windows and the panoramic sunroof and bask in the sheer unusualness of it all.

Prices are hard to gauge as Avantimes are such rare cars (we found only two for sale) but £6500 seems to be the starting point for reasonable examples. Do consult dedicated buyers’ guides though as there are a few issues to look out for.

6. Toyota GR Yaris

1.6-litre three-cylinder 261hp

0-62mph 5.5 seconds

Top speed 142mph

To say reviews of the Toyota GR Yaris were rave is an understatement: this four-wheel-drive rally-bred hot hatch blew testers away with its grip engagement and sheer capability.

And while the GR Yaris shares its name with the sensible hybrid supermini don’t think the two cars have much in common besides that: the GR features two fewer doors and is built on a different mechanical platform. Used values remain stable starting at around £32000 for the desirable (and popular) Circuit Pack model.

7. Alpine A110

1.8-litre four-cylinder 252hp

0-62mph 4.5 seconds

Top speed 155mph

The Alpine A110 is arguably the spiritual successor to the Lotus Elise: aluminium bodied incredibly light at 1102kg despite meeting modern safety standards (a Porsche Cayman is around 300kg heavier) and with just the right amount of power to be feasibly used on the road.

The A110 also offers superlative handling while its relatively attainable price only adds to the appeal. Early 2018 cars start at around £46000 just £4000 or so less than a brand-new model is available for.

8. Porsche 911 997 Carrera S

3.8-litre flat six 355hp

0-62mph 4.8 seconds

Top speed 182mph

There are so many different versions of Porsche 911 to choose from that any selection is fraught with bewildering choice but the 997 version both resolves the divisive ‘runny egg’ headlights of the earlier 996 while also being relatively attainable.

The 355hp Carrera 2 should provide all the performance you need with a 186mph top speed and 0-62mph taking just 4.8 seconds. Rarer models are clearly more desirable but with a 2005 65000-mile Carrera 2 coming in at around £27000 that’s relatively little outlay for a potentially appreciating Porsche.

9. Vauxhall Monaro

5.-7litre V8 354hp

0-60mph 6 seconds

Top speed 160mph

The Vauxhall Monaro is a car full of surprises. First it’s a Vauxhall with a whopping 5.7-litre V8 under the bonnet and second while its high CO2 emissions make it pretty expensive to tax it actually complies with London’s ULEZ and other emission zones.

But such a sensible credential is no reason to buy the Monaro. No instead consider the appeal of a traditional old-fashioned V8 muscle car with the added bonus of rear seats. The Monaro is rare and prices have been climbing slowly for some time now but you can pick up a 60000-mile 2006 example for around £13500 at time of writing.

10. Honda Integra Type R DC2

1.8-litre four-cylinder 190hp

0-60mph 6.2 second

Top speed 145mph

Generally considered one of the best-handling front-wheel-drive cars of all time the Integra Type R is also renowned for its rev-hungry 1.8-litre engine which features variable valve timing that comes into the fray at 6000rpm before peak power at 8000 rpm on its way to the 9000rpm red line.

Such a high-revving engine gives enormous character to the DC2 but the precision of the handling the high levels of grip and the sheer engineering pedigree also shine through. Prices have been on the rise for a while but you can still pick up a 70000-mile Type R for £16000 or so.

For example an advertiser using Best Buy’s retail media network gets access to the information Best Buy has on me like what I’ve searched for on its site pages I’ve viewed carts I’ve abandoned reviews I’ve written emails I’ve opened service appointments I’ve scheduled and purchases I’ve made. As the company puts it “these inputs create a rich profile of audiences’ objectives interests and intent”. There might be other inputs besides the above that are up for sale too.

Retail media networks are advertising platforms owned by a retailer with first party relationships with customers. Here retailers can sell their customers’ data to advertisers for targeting ads on the channels that the retailer owns. (And in some cases on other channels all across the web.)

Last week I called Best Buy to check if it had the printer ink I needed in stock. The first question the associate asked before I could even say what I was calling about was for my name phone number and email address. Best Buy doesn’t need any of that to tell me if there’s ink on the shelves – but it’s sure valuable for it to have. That’s because Best Buy is one of a whole slew of consumer-facing businesses that has recently established a retail media network.

Some companies like Visa and Mastercard sell their customer’s data in the existing data broker and auction market. But others are taking a different approach – aided by the near-absolute saturation of online commerce in all parts of retail many companies are blending the role of retailer data broker and advertising platform all in one by establishing what’s called retail media networks.

Just because you have a direct relationship with these companies however doesn’t mean they’re keeping your info to themselves. Thanks in part to Google’s killing off third party tracking cookies demand for first party data has risen  and companies with direct relationships with customers have realized they’re sitting on valuable troves of information. The result: a lot of companies that sell goods & services to customers are getting into the business of selling their customers’ data.

First party data is what a company gathers on its customers directly. Swipe your MasterCard and MasterCard has data on you. Place an order on the McDonald’s app and McDonald’s has data on you. Stream on Disney+ and Disney has data on you. This is all first party data.

One thing has started to become clear for AdTech’s future: data harvesting by companies you’ve never heard of is out and data harvesting by companies you know is in. Enter the age of first party data.

This AdTech model is changing in response to the passage and implementation of new regulations in Europe and California and a public becoming more unnerved by being watched so closely with no power to stop it. Eyeing new targeted advertising models of their own Apple and Google have shaken up the field for other AdTech companies. Apple released a new iOS feature in 2021 to cut down on the harvesting of user data on iPhones and Google has announced it will phase third party tracking cookies out of Chrome by a date that keeps getting pushed back but most recently was set for late 2024 .

The Internet we’ve all come to know has essentially one business model: offer a useful or entertaining service through a website or phone app and collect users’ data as payment that many don’t even realize is owed. While we use many of our favorite sites & apps third party companies like data brokers install tracking technology on our devices  gathering info about us they can package into profiles detailing where we work & live who our friends & family are what we spend our time doing and what personality traits & behavioral patterns we exhibit. These dossiers compiled on each of us are sold to the highest bidder in invisible auctions happening behind every page we load. Hundreds of companies we’ve never heard of know every site we’ve visited search we’ve conducted app we’ve opened and what makes us most likely to do what companies want us to do: buy stuff they show us in targeted ads  and stare at our screens longer so they can show us as many targeted ads as possible.

The targeted advertising industry also known as AdTech is tussling with itself over its future. One of the significant emerging trends is the entry of a new kind of broker in the marketplace for people’s data: the retail businesses you’ve been shopping at all along.

The online targeted advertising industry is currently mid-evolution. After five years of new regulations rising consumer concern and significant backend changes at some Big Tech companies the broader ad technology industry is scrambling for new ways to carry out its business model. Understanding the trajectories of this industry built on harvesting and commodifying our personal data is important – both for decision makers looking to regulate it and for anyone hoping to control the information collected about us by companies intending to make money off it.

Of course in many cases the customer data sold through retail media networks isn’t limited to targeting ads on a retailer’s channels. A retailer partnering with existing AdTech companies like Criteo for example can offer advertisers the chance to use its customer’s data to target ads all across the web. In this way some retail media networks are largely a new incarnation of the old system.

Best Buy is far from the only retailer entering the AdTech business. It joins Target Walmart Lowe’s Kohl’s Kroger Dollar Tree Marriott CVS Macy’s Albertson’s and Walgreens all getting into the data and online advertising business themselves.

The data harvesters toolbox: rewards programs memberships logins and subscriptions

Not all data is created equal – the most valuable is info that’s linked to a specific customer allowing advertisers to target an individual based on past current and predicted future behavior. There are lots of ways companies collecting first party data can incentivize us to give up as much data as possible.

Loyalty programs collect your data

Loyalty programs are not only good for rewarding customers – they’re good for tracking them too. The airlines in the 80s were the first to figure this out using frequent flier programs to both incentivize customers and build some of the earliest corporate databases of customer identities and activities.

Doling out perks via a physical punch card is one thing but when rewards programs are mediated digitally – as they often are today – they have the capacity to become a vehicle for extensive and detailed data collection.

Today many loyalty programs are administered through apps giving customers the ability to place orders in advance or pay with a scan of a phone. For customers it’s about convenience and accumulating rewards. For companies they get data on our consumption habits they can commodify in a number of ways including selling it to outside parties like advertisers.

And of course getting you to download a smartphone app only increases the amount of extraneous data collection that’s possible. Earlier this year the Tim Hortons app for example was found to be constantly collecting users’ location even when the app was closed.

Memberships collect your data

Like loyalty programs memberships are a way to encourage customers to continually identify themselves allowing companies to record all of their interactions with you in a running log. In order to shop at Sam’s Club for example you have to be a registered member and provide your member info every time you check out.

Incidentally Sam’s Club announced the establishment of its own retail media network last month. The company has long had access to heaps of data such as who exactly shops at its stores at which locations and at what times of day and crucially every single item every single one of its customers has ever bought. As a Sam’s Club VP put it in a blog post announcing their new advertising venture: “As a membership organization we have an incredible amount of insight on our members. Not only do we have 100% visibility into their purchases but we also know their search behaviors.”

Logins can collect your data

Logins are another way to force otherwise anonymous users to identify themselves. You’ve probably noticed every time you go to create an account with a new site or app Google and Facebook ask if you’d rather use your existing account with them. Letting them serve as an intermediary allows both them and the site you’re creating an account with to share data associating what you do across sites & apps and across time to you specifically with as little uncertainty about your identity as possible.

As third party tracking cookies continue to deteriorate it’s likely the use of login gates for online sites will rise. Akin to paywalls login gates keep web content out of view until you make an account with your email or phone number and login every visit making whatever data they collect first party data. Not every company and site will rush to this model but it’s likely a number of them will and it’s similar to what some publishers like news outlets are already doing.

Logins are already a familiar feature for most particularly thanks to the digital subscriptions that are central to a consumer’s life today. Which are also tools for data harvesters.

Subscriptions can collect your data

Services that use the monthly subscription model rely on logins to ensure that the only person accessing a digital service is the one who’s paying for it. The biggest example is the streaming services – and because everyone has to be logged in to stream streaming is of course becoming a big player in the future AdTech model.

NBCUniversal was one of the earlier companies to start offering its user data up to advertisers airing ads on the platform. Clients of NBCUniversal can match their first party data with that of NBCUniversal’s as well as supplement with third-party data through NBCUniversal’s AdTech service to figure out as much about a consumer’s behavior as possible including how they respond to ads. With the pandemic the increase in the number of people spending more and more time streaming on their TVs has led others like Disney+ to expand AdTech capabilities. Netflix’s recent downturn in subscribers has led the company to make plans for an ad-tier subscription and it recently announced a partnership with Microsoft’s new AdTech arm to do it.

The future is first party

The old AdTech model isn’t dead yet – lots of free and cheap sites & apps are still serving as fronts for data harvesting operations. But increasingly retail businesses are becoming AdTech companies themselves and the broader AdTech industry is hoping this will earn consumers’ trust back by making the data broker a company that customers have at least heard of. But there’s plenty about this new first party data model that may not be very trustworthy in the end.

For one how clear these businesses will be with customers about the use of their data remains to be seen. So is how they’ll go about gathering a consumer’s consent and more importantly if people will have real choice or control about what happens to their data; if agreeing to data sales is obligatory to being able to shop at a retailer or use a streaming platform it’s closer to consumer coercion than it is to getting consent.

This all raises a question: how is it that companies can collect whatever data about us they want and sell it to whomever they want and use it in ways that have nothing to do with the service we’re expecting to get when we shop at their store or download their app or become a subscriber?

We’re currently barreling towards a future where the only way to control your data is to not participate in society at all. You could argue we’ve arrived there already. It’s possible however to change this trajectory with meaningful new rules that understand both how the web-enabled economy works today and where it’s headed tomorrow. Without forward-looking action we risk finding ourselves up for sale in more and more ways facing consequences we have yet to discover."

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces transient systemic innate immune responses in vivo which include the activation of TLR RIG-I and other inflammatory signaling pathways providing potential latency reversal stimuli252627. We therefore first assessed whether the exposure of ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or purified CD4+ T-cells from ART-suppressed donors (Supplementary Table 1) would release HIV RNA if exposed to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines ex vivo. PBMC samples were from SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals with most cryopreserved prior to 2020. Cells from an initial participant were used to establish a dose-response curve which showed peak HIV RNA release after stimulation with either the Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines at 1–5% of the culture volume – with the former showing greater induction (Fig. 1A). This approach was extended to 5 additional donors testing the 1% and 5% doses of both mRNA vaccines alongside 2% volume/volume of FluzoneTM quadrivalent inactivated-virus influenza vaccine as well as previously established optimal concentrations of the latency-reversing agents Bryostatin-1 and romidepsin and the mitogen phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA). We observed significant reactivation across this cohort following 1% BNT162b2 treatment (Fig. 1B) with a lesser degree of overall reactivation with 5% BNT162b2 treatment (p < 0.05 by paired t-test) and less consistent reactivation with 1% mRNA-1273 treatment (p = 0.12 by paired t-test). Treatment with influenza vaccine did not induce detectable release of HIV RNA in this ex vivo system.

Established latency-reversing agents (LRAs) performed relatively poorly in this assay which we attribute to cell-free RNA being a particularly rigorous measure of latency reversal (ex. romidepsin has previously been shown to induce detectable cell-associated but not cell-free RNA28). Though induction of HIV release was marginal in response to bryostatin-1 and PHA flow cytometric analysis of CD69 expression confirmed the very high levels of T-cell activation expected with these agents28 (Fig. 1C). Influenza vaccine treatment was also associated with appreciable CD4+ T-cell activation despite a lack of viral RNA release. Interestingly neither of the SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induced T-cell activation by this measure (Fig. 1C). SARS CoV-2 vaccines also did not appreciably impact cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 1). Using cell pellets corresponding to the supernatants assessed in Fig. 1B we further observed that 1% BNT162b2 treatment increased levels of cell-associated HIV RNA (Fig. 1D) – corroborating LRA activity. Thus in this ex vivo experimental system the SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 induced HIV latency reversal without the T-cell activation typically observed with most potent latency-reversing agents.

To probe the mechanisms underlying mRNA vaccine-induced latency reversal we purified CD4+ T-cells from three of the samples studied in Fig. 1B C and subjected these to bulk mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) along with corresponding influenza vaccine (FluzoneTM) treated samples. The majority of variance between samples could be attributed to treatment effects though with the 1% BNT162b2 samples showing relatively little divergence from untreated (No Treatment) samples (Fig. 1E). Correspondingly treatment with the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines yielded relatively few numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to untreated samples: 71 DEGs for 1% BNT162b2 and 193 DEGs for Moderna’s mRNA-1273 (adj. p value < 0.05). The FluzoneTM influenza vaccine had a substantially greater impact on the host transcriptional profile with 3424 DEGs.

Despite limited overall transcriptional perturbations gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) implicated biologically relevant signaling pathways that largely overlapped between the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 treatments (Fig. 1F). Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors are the primary innate immune receptors of viral RNA which when stimulated induce type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines29. The results implicated both the pathway itself and the downstream IFN response in these mRNA vaccine treatments. BNT162b2 further implicated toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. TLR-7 and TLR-8 comprise additional innate immune sensors of foreign ssRNA. They are predominately expressed by myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) where signaling results in the release of type I IFN as well as TNF. TLR-7 agonists including GS-9620 have been established as HIV LRAs. We have previously shown that these act predominately by driving the release of TNF which induces NFκb activation and resulting proviral transcriptional initiation in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells30. The observed activation of TNF signaling via the NFκb pathway implies an analogous mode of action for BNT162b2 (Fig. 1F G). Of note these ex vivo transcriptional perturbations are in agreement with those observed in the days following in vivo vaccination with BNT162b2 - where RIG-I like receptor signaling TLR and inflammatory signaling and the type I IFN response feature prominently31.

mRNA vaccination drives selective increases in HIV-Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell responses

To assess if HIV reactivation occurred in vivo following first and second vaccine doses we queried HIV-specific T-cell responses for evidence of antigenic stimulation using activation-induced marker (AIM) assays (assessing co-induction of CD69 and CD137) at baseline (Visit 1 V1) and ∼2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose 1 (Visit 2 V2; median range: 17 14-24 days) and dose 2 (Visit 3 V3; median range: 16 14–24 days) in a cohort of 13 antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated adults with plasma HIV RNA below the limits of detection by a standard clinical assay (Table 1). Timelines for all clinical cohorts in this study are depicted in Fig. 2. As an aside we first note that direct virologic assessments of HIV expression following initial vaccination would have been valuable – but would require sample timepoints from the days following vaccination which were not collected. We did collect these early timepoints following mRNA vaccine boosters (third dose) where we observed significant increases in cell-associated HIV RNA (Supplementary Table 2 Supplementary Fig. 2). We did not detect cell-free HIV RNA in the plasma from these timepoints (a higher threshold for latency reversal) using the same assay as in Fig. 1A B. These results are consistent with a moderate degree of HIV reactivation not leading to appreciable viremia. Returning to T-cell responses following initial vaccine doses we observed the expected inductions of SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses following vaccine dose 1 (V2) which were further enhanced following dose 2 (V3) from means of CD8 – 0.03% AIM + (V1) to 0.08% AIM + (V2) and 0.11% AIM + (V3); and CD4 − 0.04% AIM + (V1) to 0.07% AIM + (V2) and 0.13% AIM + (Fig. 3A–C). Corresponding with this SARS-CoV-2 anti-S serology tests showed reactivity in 2/13 individuals at V1 10/12 at V2 and 13/13 at V3. In contrast no significant changes were observed in HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T-cells HIV-Nef-specific CD4+ T-cell responses nor cytomegalovirus (CMV)-pp65-specific responses (included as an irrelevant control) (Fig. 3B C) nor in anti-HIV gp120 antibody levels (Supplementary Fig. 3). However we did observe trends towards increases in HIV-Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell responses following first vaccine dose from a mean of 0.06% AIM + (V1) to 0.09% AIM + (V2) – p = 0.06 (Fig. 3B).

We took two approaches to further assess this increase in Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell responses following the first vaccine dose given that it was on the margin of statistical significance: i) We performed these same AIM assays on an independent cohort (n = 15) and ii) We re-assessed T-cell responses in this original cohort by gzm-B ELISPOT a more selective readout of cells that have recently encountered antigen in vivo163233. Our independent validation cohort was based in Vancouver Canada and had samples from baseline (pre-vaccine V1) and ∼4 weeks after both SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose 1 (V2; median 31 range 28–37 days) and dose 2 (V3; median 30 range 27–32) (Table 1 & Fig. 3)34. Due to Canada’s decision to delay second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses due to limited initial vaccine supply the time between first and second vaccine doses was significantly longer for the Vancouver (median 54 range 49–61 days) compared to the New York cohort (median 27 range 21–57 days). As such the V3 results are not directly comparable. For the Vancouver cohort we observed a significant increase in HIV-Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell responses following the first vaccine dose from a mean of 0.05% AIM + (V1) to 0.09% AIM + (V2) – p = 0.03 (Fig. 3D). No such increases were observed for HIV-Gag or CMV-pp65 while SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were induced as expected (Fig. 3D). Thus AIM results from the validation cohort further support our hypothesis by showing unique boosting of HIV-Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell responses following the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Both effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells readily produce IFN-γ in vitro in response to their cognate antigens evidencing either past or ongoing antigen exposure. Granzyme-B (gzm-B) production following short-term in vitro stimulation however is a distinguishing feature of virus-specific effector CD8+ T-cells that have recently encountered antigen in vivo through either infection or vaccination (with induction from memory CD8+ T-cells requiring >24 h of in vitro stimulation)161718. To further test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination can reactivate HIV expression we assessed gzm-B and IFN-γ responses in parallel by ELISPOT using peptide pools spanning each of: HIV-Gag HIV-Env HIV-Pol HIV-Nef HIV-Tat HIV-Rev HIV-Vif/Vpr/Vpu (combined pool) CMV-pp65 and SARS-CoV-2-Spike1135. Amongst the HIV-specific responses increases were uniquely observed in gzm-B-producing responses to the early gene products Nef and Rev – spiking between V1 (baseline) and V2 (vaccine dose 1) from means of 71 and 50 spot forming units (SFU)/106 PBMC to 220 and 129 SFU/106 PBMCs respectively (Nef – 3.1-fold increase p = 0.002 Rev – 2.6-fold increase p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A B). No inductions of Nef- or Gag-specific T-cell responses were observed following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in a cohort of HIV-negative individuals ruling out HIV- SARS-CoV-2-Spike cross-reactivity as a driver of these increases (Supplementary Fig. 4A B). As expected we observed inductions of SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific T-cell responses as measured by either gzm-B (means: V1 − 42 SFU/106 PBMCs V2 − 51 SFU/106 PBMCs V3 − 71 SFU/106 PBMCs) or IFN-γ (means: V1 – 13 SFU/106 PBMCs V2 − 47 SFU/106 PBMCs V3 − 114 SFU/106 PBMCs) and a lack of significant changes in CMV-pp65-specific responses (Fig. 4). Note that the somewhat weak gzm-B character of the SARS-CoV-2 responses is likely attributable to their predominant CD4 component (Fig. 3C). Correlations between HIV-specific T-cell responses as measured by AIM or by ELISPOT are given in Supplementary Fig. 5 and show a strong positive correlation between Nef-specific T-cell responses at V2 as measured by gzm-B ELISPOT versus AIM (CD8) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.93 p < 0.0001). These findings support the hypothesis that the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine induces HIV reactivation that is preferentially sensed by early-gene-product specific T-cells driving an effector functional profile.

Although only Nef and to a lesser extent Rev specific T-cell responses showed significant changes across the cohort by gzm-B ELISPOT we did observe some fluctuations in other responses in individual donors. For example PIDs 9 and 15 showed modest increases in CMV-pp65 responses between V1 and V2. This may have been attributable to bystander activation following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination or to natural dynamics in responses. Since we are not aware of any study that has monitored variation in gzm-B-specific responses over ∼2 week intervals we assessed this by collecting samples from a cohort of PWH that did not receive a vaccine and measured responses at similar intervals to our vaccine cohorts (V1 – V2 = 21 16-25 days and V2 – V3 = 18 13–25 days) (Supplementary Table 3). Gzm-B-producing CMV-pp65-specific responses also exhibited considerable dynamics in this control cohort with one individual showing an increase of 1153 SFU/106 PBMCs and another showing a decrease of 742 SFU/106 PBMCs between V1 and V3 (Supplementary Fig. 6). We conclude that the sporadic changes in gzm-B-producing CMV-pp65-specific in our vaccine cohort cannot be attributed to the vaccine. Future studies may ask whether gzm-B-producing CMV-pp65-specific response dynamics reflect CMV reactivation events. Levels of CD69 expression on total CD4+ T-cells also did not change across study visits (Supplementary Fig. 7) indicating a lack of substantial bystander activation. Together these data confirm that – while numerous events may cause fluctuation in gzm-B-producing responses – increases in HIV early gene product responses are unique in being attributable to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination as evidenced by consistent and significant increases across the cohort (Nef > Rev).

HIV RNA decreases in association with post-vaccine Nef-specific T-cell responses

The in vivo sensing of reactivated HIV by gzm-B-releasing Nef and/or Rev-specific T-cells may result in the elimination of some HIV-infected cells specifically those that were poised for vaccine-induced reactivation. This could also explain the lack of a clear boosting effect on Nef/Rev-specific T-cell responses following second vaccine doses (Figs. 3 and 4). Alternatively activated HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses may suppress HIV transcription through incompletely understood mechanisms36. To approach the potential impact of T-cell engagement on HIV-infected cells we first measured changes in residual cell-associated HIV RNA from baseline following each vaccination. Levels of polyadenylated HIV RNA decreased significantly over the course of the study (V1 to V3) as measured by two different sets of primers and probes targeting either the 5’ or 3’ region of the HIV genome. The target of the 5’ primers/probes is only present in unspliced HIV RNA whereas that of the 3’ primers/probes is present in all splicing isoforms (Fig. 5A). 5’ HIV RNA decreased from a mean of 2027 copies/106 CD4 cells at V1 to 1257 copies/106 CD4 cells at V3 (1.6-fold decrease p = 0.03); 3’ HIV RNA decreased from a mean of 541 copies/106 CD4 cells at V1 to 351 copies/106 CD4 cells at V3 (1.5-fold decrease p < 0.05) (Fig. 5B).

Interestingly for 3’ HIV RNA these changes showed a strong inverse correlation with Nef-specific gzm-B-producing T-cell responses at V2 (r = −0.73 p = 0.006) and trends towards inverse correlations with Nef- or Rev-specific gzm-B-producing T-cell responses at V3 (Fig. 5C and E Supplementary Table 4). Changes in 5’ HIV RNA showed evidence of a similar pattern with the relationship with Nef-specific gzm-B-producing responses at V2 near the threshold of significance. This fits with the expected observations of killing of cells transcribing HIV RNA by Nef-specific gzm-B-producing T-cells given that only the 3’ primer/probes directly detect Nef-encoding spliced transcripts whereas the 5’ primer/probes would also detect transcripts from cells where unspliced HIV RNA predominates. No correlations were observed between gzm-B-specific responses to late gene products (Gag Pol or Env) nor IFN-γ-producing responses to any gene product and either HIV RNA measure (Fig. 5C Supplementary Table 4). AIM assay results showed agreement with the gzm-B ELISPOT results with Nef-specific CD8+ (r = −0.76 p = 0.006) and – to a lesser extent – CD4+ T-cell responses (r = 0.66 p = 0.02) correlating inversely with changes in 3’ HIV mRNA (Fig. 5D E Supplementary Table 5). Thus each of the HIV-specific T-cell responses shown to be significantly increased following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose 1 (Figs. 3 and 4) were in turn correlated with reductions in HIV RNA. This supports a model whereby the induced T-cell responses either suppressed viral transcription36 and/or eliminated some of the transcriptionally competent HIV-infected cells with the demonstrated cytotoxic functionality (gzm-B) perhaps suggesting the latter37. Although we have limited ability to draw kinetic inferences from our data we propose that the associations between T-cell responses at V2 with changes in HIV RNA that manifest at V3 reflect the time it takes for these responses to expand and exert antiviral activity.

No measurable changes in HIV reservoir size following vaccinations

Measurable reductions in the frequencies of cells harboring HIV DNA would comprise more direct evidence that some infected cells had been selectively eliminated but existing assays have important limitations. Total levels of HIV DNA provide a poor representation of the ‘HIV reservoir’ (defined as infected cells with the potential to reseed viremia) due to the fact that the large majority of integrated viral genomes are defective (e.g. large deletions)38. A recently developed duplex digital-droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay termed the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) substantially improves upon this and provides a reasonable upper estimate of genomically intact proviruses39. However a further complexity is that the vast majority of these proviruses do not reactivate to produce infectious virus even after maximal in vitro stimulation39 and some may be limited by chromosomal context from ever reactivating404142. In applying the IPDA to quantify intact proviruses as well as the defective proviruses that yielded only packaging signal (Ψ) or rev response element (RRE) amplification we observed a lack of significant changes in any measure across the three visits for the 11 participants that produced valid results (Fig. 6A–C) (2 individuals showed characteristic detection failures likely attributable to HIV sequence diversity in the primer or probe binding sites43).

We selected four individuals on the bases of clear inductions of Nef-specific gzm-B releasing responses (Fig. 4) and of sample availability to measure the HIV reservoir using an alternative method – the Tat/rev Induced Limiting Dilution Assay (TILDA)44. This assay quantifies the frequencies of cells that can be induced by PMA/ionomycin to express tat or rev transcripts. Samples from two study participants (PIDs 9 and 17) showed inducible cells trending higher across visits while this measure was unchanged in PID 15 and undetectable in PID 7. Although overall interpretation is limited by the small ‘n’ available for this assay it is notable that PID 9 had the greatest magnitude increase in Nef-specific gzm-B responses in this study (Fig. 4) as well as one of the more marked drops in cell-associated HIV RNA in Fig. 5. Thus these results suggest that – despite evidence for CD8+ T-cell engagement – reductions in cells that could be induced by PMA/ionomycin to produce transcripts were not achieved following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE4MTgwODc2MjIwMDA3NjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small extracellular vesicles encapsulating lefty1 mRNA inhibit hepatic fibrosis,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1818087622000769 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE4MTgwODc2MjIwMDA3NjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRydWd0YXJnZXRyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvMTA0NjE5L3VucmF2ZWxsaW5nLWNlbGwtYmlvbG9neS10aHJvdWdoLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unravelling cell biology through artificial intelligence,"Unravelling cell biology through artificial intelligence

The AI algorithm was able to predict the presence and the location of nuclei in more than 8000 cells.

Scientists from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University Singapore have used artificial intelligence (AI) to demonstrate a correlation between cytoskeleton organisation and nuclear position. The study was recently published in PLOS.

To ensure that the study’s parameters would not be limited by human conceptualisation they developed a unique generative algorithm to interpret the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells using qualitative data without telling the system what it was observing and how to measure it.

“We separated the information related to the nucleus and the fibres in independent databases of images ensuring that there was not any information about the nucleus found in the images of the fibres so that the system could not cheat. Then we trained the system to find the location of the nucleus using only information specific to fibres. To do so the system had to take the qualitative data and figure out on its own if there was a relation between the organisation of the fibres and the position of the nucleus. This forced the programme to find the parameters defining the system free from human interpretation and predefined concepts” Associate Professor Javier G. Fernandez explained.

The algorithm was able to successfully predict the presence and the location of the nuclei in more than 8000 cells with almost half of those predictions resulting in a deviation of less than 1 μm from their exact position. This demonstrated with astounding significance the hypothesis of a deterministic relation between the arrangements of the actin filaments and the position of the nucleus one of the most basic relations in cell biology which the researchers argue that this has also resulted in an epistemological outcome.

In this analysis we included 431 previously uninfected and vaccine-naïve SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals selected as a random age-stratified sample of all SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals reported to the Department of Health of the Canton of Zurich between the 06th of August 2020 and the 19th of January 2021. During this time nearly all COVID-19 cases were due to infection with the Wildtype virus45 and vaccines were not yet available. Peripheral blood samples were collected for analysis at two weeks one month three months and six months after diagnosis (Fig. 1a). The median age of participants was 52 years (interquartile range (IQR) 35–68 years) and 212 (49%) were female (Supplementary Table 1). Fifty-nine (14%) of the participants were smokers and 131 (30%) had at least one comorbidity; most commonly hypertension (16%) and respiratory diseases (7%). Most participants (83%) were symptomatic with 163 (38%) reporting between one and five symptoms and 192 (45%) reporting six or more symptoms during acute infection. Within two weeks of diagnosis 18 (4%) participants required hospitalization for reasons related to COVID-19 among which two participants were admitted to an intensive care unit. At six months after diagnosis three participants (0.7%) reported a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and 80 (19%) had received at least one vaccine dose (all with mRNA vaccines).

We selected a subsample of 64 individuals for a detailed characterization of immune responses for which we performed additional anti-N IgG antibody testing neutralization assays as well as M N S1 and S2 domain-specific ELISpot and flow cytometric analyses of virus-specific T cells. The subsample was selected to cover the spectrum of disease severity (i.e. asymptomatic to hospitalized) and antibody responses (i.e. low to high anti-S IgA and IgG antibody responses) while balanced for age and sex (Fig. 1b). The median age of subsample participants was 53.5 (IQR 33.5–68 years) and 56% were female (Supplementary Table 1). 69% of subsample participants had symptoms of COVID-19 with 27% reporting between one and five symptoms and 42% reporting six or more symptoms. Eleven (17%) participants were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and one participant required admission to an intensive care unit.

Kinetics of S-specific IgA and IgG and N-specific IgG responses

Using a highly sensitive Luminex-based assay46 we first assessed levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgA and IgG or N-specific IgG in blood plasma over time. Within the full study population (total n = 431) we found that 83% (95% confidence interval (CI) 79–86%) of individuals were anti-S IgA seropositive at two weeks post-diagnosis decreasing to 70% (65–75%) at six months (Supplementary Fig. 1a Supplementary Table 2). Median anti-S IgA titers were highest at two weeks post-diagnosis and declined steadily up to six months (Fig. 2a Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Similarly anti-S IgG seropositivity was 82% (78–86%) at two weeks but remained stable at 81% (77–85%) at six months of follow-up (Supplementary Fig. 1a Supplementary Table 2). Median anti-S IgG titers peaked later at one-month post-diagnosis persisted until three months and then waned slightly until the six-month follow-up (Fig. 2b). Overall 85% of the population was positive for either anti-S IgA or IgG at three months (81–88%) and six months (81–88%) post-diagnosis. Of note only ten participants (2.3%) were initially seropositive (either anti-S IgA or IgG) but became seronegative within six months. Estimates were similar when adjusting for the age group-stratified sampling approach (Supplementary Table 4).

Within the subsample (total n = 64) we found that 54% (42–66%) were seropositive for anti-N IgG at two weeks which declined to 41% (29–54%) at 6 months (Supplementary Fig. 1b Supplementary Table 3). N-specific responses followed a similar initial kinetic to that of anti-S IgG (peaking at one month) but with a more pronounced decline over time (Fig. 2c). Seropositivity for anti-S IgA and anti-S IgG among subsample participants was 59% at two weeks and 61% and 66% at six months respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1b Supplementary Table 3). These lower proportions of seropositivity in the subsample were expected as we aimed to specifically include individuals with low antibody responses in our assessment of T cell responses. To confirm our findings we further tested these samples using two commercially available assays which detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-specific or N-specific total Ig (Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2) respectively. With both additional assays we observed a high percent agreement (98.7% for anti-S Ig and 91.2% for anti-N Ig seropositivity; Supplementary Fig. 1c d) and correlation with the corresponding Luminex-based tests (Spearman r = 0.89 for anti-S Ig Spearman r = 0.86 for anti-N Ig; Supplementary Fig. 1e f) supporting our initial results.

Rapid loss of neutralizing activity against variants of concern

To better understand the potential duration of antibody-mediated protection in the light of emerging variants of concern we evaluated neutralizing activity against Wildtype SARS-CoV-2 and Delta and Omicron variants in the subsample using a cell-free and virus-free surrogate neutralization assay47. Less than half (45% 95% CI 33–58%) of subsample participants (68% of those that were seropositive for at least one evaluated Ig isotype) developed neutralizing responses against Wildtype SARS-CoV-2. These responses peaked at one month post-diagnosis followed by a rapid decline continuing up to six months (Fig. 2d–f Supplementary Fig. 2a b Supplementary Table 3). Importantly only 15% (8–26%) of subsample participants (23% of seropositives) developed neutralizing responses against the Delta variant and only one participant (2% 0–9%; 3% of seropositives) developed neutralizing responses against the Omicron variant suggesting only limited protection. Interestingly neutralizing activity was markedly higher among older participants (Fig. 2d–f).

Slower anti-S IgG decay vs. anti-S IgA N IgG neutralizing activity

From these data we next estimated the half-life of each antibody subtype as well as neutralizing antibody activity based on a linear decay model. In the overall study population we estimated the half-life to be 71 days (95% CI 66–76 days; Fig. 3a Supplementary Table 5) for anti-S IgA and 145 days (135–156 days; Fig. 3b) for anti-S IgG. In the subsample we estimated the half-life of anti-N IgG to be 86 days (76–99 days; Fig. 3c) with half-lives for anti-S IgA and IgG being similar to the overall study population (Supplementary Table 5). For neutralizing antibody responses we estimated half-lives to be 70 days (55–94 days; Fig. 3d) for anti-Wildtype and 46 days (33–77 days; Fig. 3e) for anti-Delta neutralizing antibodies (anti-Omicron was not estimable). Taken together these findings suggest that S-specific IgG responses are more robust than S-specific IgA or N-specific IgG responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition neutralizing activity declines more rapidly than overall antibody levels and neutralizing activity against Delta and Omicron variants is low to non-existent after a single Wildtype SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Sustained anti-N anti-S2 and CD8+ T cell responses

We next evaluated virus-specific T cell populations in the subsample first using an interferon-gamma ELISpot assay to assess responses to four overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire SARS-CoV-2 M or N proteins the S1 domain of the S protein (which contains the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD)) or a mix of other predicted immunodominant epitopes within the S protein containing the majority of the S2 domain (which we refer to here as S2 for simplicity). We found that 84% (95% CI 72–91%) of individuals had detectable T cell responses to at least one or more of the four tested peptide pools at two weeks post-diagnosis dropping to 71% (58–81%) at six months (Fig. 4a Supplementary Fig. 2c Supplementary Table 3). For the pooled T cell response (summed responses to M N S1 or S2) we estimated a half-life of 161 days (95% CI 83–2810 days; Supplementary Fig. 2d Supplementary Table 5).

The proportion of participants positive to individual peptide pools ranged from 71% (95% CI 59–82%; S2) to 80% (68–89%; M) at two weeks to 46% (33–59%; S1) to 51% (38–64%; N) at six months (Fig. 4a Supplementary Fig. 2c Supplementary Table 3). The number of detectable M-specific and S1-specific T cells declined significantly over time (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03 Kruskal–Wallis test; p = 0.04 and p = 0.14 Friedman test; Fig. 4a) while numbers of detectable N-specific and S2-specific T cells were more stable. Assessing the summed response to all four peptide pools we found that at two weeks M-specific and S1-specific T cells made up 33% and 29% respectively of the total detectable T cell response compared to 26% for each individual antigen at six months (Fig. 4b). In contrast at two weeks N-specific and S2-specific T cells made up 21% and 16% of the T cell response whereas they comprised 27% and 21% of the total response at six months. We further found the half-life of M-specific and S1-specific T cells to be substantially shorter (138 and 137 days respectively) compared to that of N-specific and S2-specific T cells (251 days and 382 days respectively) suggesting that the latter may provide more durable responses following infection (Supplementary Fig. 2e–h).

We then assessed virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in the subsample using a flow cytometry-based Activation-Induced Marker (AIM) assay. Using the markers CD137 (4-1BB) and CD134 (OX-40) for CD4+ T cells or CD69 and CD137 for CD8+ T cells we determined frequencies of activated cells following in vitro stimulation with a single combined megapool of M N S1 and S2 peptides (Fig. 4c). We found similar frequencies of total peripheral blood AIM+CD4+ or AIM+CD8+ T cells (approximately 0.2–0.3% of CD4+ or CD8+) at two weeks post-diagnosis. For CD4+ T cells this was 0.1% at six months though this decline did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.11 Kruskal–Wallis test; p = 0.14 Friedman test; Fig. 4d). In contrast for CD8+ T cells frequencies of AIM+ cells remained at 0.2% up to six months post-diagnosis. In assessing the phenotype of AIM+ T cells in the blood AIM+CD4+ T cells were predominantly central memory T cells (TCM) while AIM+CD8+ T cells were predominantly T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA; Fig. 4e). Taken together our results suggest that anti-S IgG along with N-specific and S2-specific T cells may act as more long-lasting components of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity following infection and that circulating virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells tend to provide protection through more TCM-like and TEMRA-like functions respectively.

Moderate concordance between antibody and T cell responses

Using the data obtained from our analyses of the subsample we next sought to better understand the relationship within and between antibody and T cell responses over time. Within the overall antibody response (anti-S IgA anti-S IgG anti-N IgG) we observed a strong positive correlation in the magnitude (assessed as MFI ratios) of responses among different subtypes at each timepoint post-diagnosis (Fig. 5a). Similarly within the overall T cell response we observed a strong positive correlation in the magnitude (assessed as SFU/1e6 PBMCs) of responses among the four different peptide pools (M N S1 S2) at each timepoint (Fig. 5a).

In comparing antibody and T cell responses the correlation was less robust though still present. At two weeks post-diagnosis we observed a weak to moderate positive correlation between the magnitude of each antibody subtype evaluated and pooled T cell (summed M N S1 or S2) responses (anti-S IgA Spearman r = 0.38; anti-S IgG Spearman r = 0.37; anti-N IgG Spearman r = 0.47; Fig. 5a). This correlation decreased over time and was weak or no longer observed by six months of follow-up (anti-S IgA Spearman r = 0.16; anti-S IgG Spearman r = 0.25; anti-N IgG Spearman r = 0.24). These findings indicate that antibody and T cell responses tend to behave similarly (in terms of magnitude) early in the immune response but not necessarily in the longer term. Furthermore they suggest that the magnitude of the response by one antibody subtype is better predicted by the response to other antibody subtypes than by T cell responses and vice versa.

We also evaluated the proportion of individuals that were tested positive (presence of detectable responses) or negative (absence of detectable responses) for antibody and T cell responses at each time point comparing anti-S IgA anti-S IgG or anti-N IgG (MFI ratio above the limit of detection) to overall T cell responses (detectable SFU to one or more peptide pools; Fig. 5b) or to specific individual peptide pools (Supplementary Fig. 3a). At two weeks post-diagnosis approximately 55–60% of subsample participants were both antibody positive and overall T cell positive while approximately 10-15% were both antibody negative and overall T cell negative (Fig. 5b). Thus the percent concordance between antibody responses and overall T cell responses was ~70% and was similar for anti-S IgA anti-S IgG and anti-N IgG. By six months concordance between antibody and overall T cell responses dropped to 55–60% (depending on antibody subtype). For both anti-S IgA and anti-S IgG this appeared to be primarily due to an increased fraction of participants becoming overall T cell negative. For anti-N IgG this drop appeared to be additionally driven by an increasing fraction of anti-N IgG negative participants. Patterns of antibody subtype and T cell concordance were also similar between T cells specific to individual peptide pools and analogous trends were observed when evaluating test agreement using Cohen’s Kappa (Supplementary Fig. 3a b). Together these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses correlate early after infection but that this correlation decreases with increasing time after infection.

Cluster analysis identifies five distinct joint immune trajectories

We subsequently explored whether distinct patterns of joint antibody and T cell responses could be observed using a non-parametric longitudinal clustering algorithm48. We identified five distinct joint trajectories of antibody subtype and peptide pool-specific T cell responses within the subsample (Fig. 6a b). Clusters of participants were primarily defined by the presence (clusters 1-4) or absence (cluster 5) of antibody responses as well as distinct T cell trajectories. When present antibody trajectories generally followed the decay patterns observed in the overall study population characterized by waning anti-S IgA and anti-N IgG and persistent anti-S IgG though to differing levels. Meanwhile T cell trajectories between clusters were more heterogenous. We additionally examined neutralization and flow cytometry data which did not influence clustering to assess independent differences in immune phenotypes between clusters.

Participants in the first cluster (14% of the subsample n = 9) had the highest initial antibody (anti-S IgA anti-S IgG anti-N IgG) and T cell (M N S1 S2) responses which remained high across all evaluated timepoints (Fig. 6a b Supplementary Fig. 4a). Compared to other clusters we further found that individuals in this cluster had the most robust neutralizing activity against Wildtype SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant and along with cluster 2 the greatest frequencies of AIM+CD4+ and AIM+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6c). We noted that participants belonging to the first cluster were mostly older than 65 years (89%) male (56%) and 22% were smokers (Fig. 6d). The majority (78%) had more than six COVID-19 symptoms and 44% were hospitalized within two weeks of diagnosis indicating more severe disease. Thus cluster 1 tended to represent older individuals with more severe disease and robust antibody and T cell immune responses.

The second cluster (12% of the subsample n = 8) contained individuals with persistently high anti-S IgA and IgG responses who also demonstrated a steep increase in virus-specific T cells from two weeks to one month post-diagnosis (Fig. 6a b). T cell positivity subsequently declined to nearly non-detectable levels by six months post-diagnosis with N-specific T cells being the dominant remaining subset present in 63% of participants (Fig. 6b Supplementary Fig. 4a). Unlike cluster 1 median neutralizing activity was only above the detection limit for Wildtype SARS-CoV-2 but not the Delta variant. Similar to cluster 1 frequencies of AIM+CD4+ and AIM+CD8+ T cells were higher than in other clusters (Fig. 6c) and most (63%) participants had six or more symptoms and 25% were hospitalized (Fig. 6d). Participants in this cluster were mostly younger than 65 years (63%) female (63%) and non-smokers or ex-smokers (75%). Thus cluster 2 was composed mostly of younger females with more severe disease robust antibody responses with limited neutralizing activity and T cell responses which peaked somewhat later and were mostly undetectable by six months.

For individuals in the third cluster (19% of the subsample n = 12) peak antibody responses were observed at two weeks and then declined sharply. Median anti-N IgG responses were below the detection limit by six months while anti-S IgA and IgG were still detectable in most participants (Fig. 6a b Supplementary Fig. 4a). Neutralizing responses to both Wildtype and Delta SARS-CoV-2 were generally below the limit of detection (Fig. 6c). T cell responses initially waned between two weeks and one month and then increased again for all peptide pools by three and six months post-diagnosis at which point 92% of participants had detectable N-specific and S2-specific T cells (Fig. 6a b Supplementary Fig. 4a). This pattern was also observed with AIM+CD8+ (but not AIM+CD4+) T cells (Fig. 6c). The characteristics of the participants in this cluster were similar to those in the second cluster but with only 8% requiring hospitalization during acute infection (Fig. 6d). Together cluster 3 contains individuals with more mild disease and more moderate less-well-sustained antibody responses but with T cell responses which increase over time.

The fourth cluster (16% of the subsample n = 10) was characterized by the presence of antibodies and a rapid decline of T cells specific to all peptide pools between the two week and one month follow-up visits. By six months post-diagnosis median T cell responses for all peptide pools were below the limit of detection by ELISpot assay though AIM+CD8+ T cells could be detected in several participants (Fig. 6b c Supplementary Fig. 4a) possibly indicating a T cell differentiation stage with limited interferon-gamma production. This cluster was characterized by participants who were predominantly male (80%) younger than 65 years (70%) and non-smokers or ex-smokers (100%; Fig. 6d). About 40% reported having six symptoms or more and 40% were hospitalized in the acute phase. Together cluster 4 appears to be comprised of young males with moderate to severe disease but who also have less-well-sustained antibody and T cell responses.

Participants in the fifth cluster (39% of the subsample n = 25) demonstrated persistently low and primarily negative antibody responses with variable T cell responses. Half of the participants had detectable M-specific and N-specific T cells across all assessments (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In general however median T cells responses tended to be lower than for other clusters by ELISpot and by AIM assay. Most individuals within this cluster were younger than 65 years (80%) and female (68%). Most participants also had mild disease as reflected by the low reported symptom count with none of the individuals requiring hospitalization (Fig. 6d). That individuals in cluster 5 experience relatively mild disease in the absence of substantial antibody responses suggests compensatory protection through cellular immune responses possibly in addition to the monitored T cell responses including T cells localized to tissues or specific to viral proteins not captured by the assays used in this study.

Overall our findings highlight the substantial heterogeneity in antibody and circulating T cell responses between individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection while also demonstrating the presence of distinct joint immune trajectories within which individuals share similar patterns of immune phenotypes as well as demographic and clinical characteristics.

Demographic and clinical factors associated with immune responses

Lastly we evaluated whether individual demographic and clinical factors described within the clusters were associated with immune responses in the overall study population using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression analyses. Consistent with other reports61619262728293149 we found that older age (≥65 years; p < 0.001 t-test based on mixed-effects linear regression model using Satterthwaite’s method50) male sex (p = 0.011 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method) higher symptom severity including one to five (p < 0.001 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method) or more than six COVID-19 symptoms (p < 0.001 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method) as well as hospitalization (p = 0.006 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method) were all independently associated with higher anti-S IgG MFI ratios over time (Fig. 7a Supplementary Table 6). Conversely being a current smoker was associated with lower responses (p = 0.010 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method). Results for anti-S IgA MFI ratios in the overall population were comparable (Fig. 7b Supplementary Table 7) and similar trends were identified for anti-N IgG MFI ratios within the subsample (Fig. 7c). For T cell responses we found that older age (≥65 years; p < 0.001 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method) and having more than six symptoms (p < 0.001 t-test via Satterthwaite’s method) during acute infection were each independently associated with higher T cell numbers over time within the subsample (Fig. 7d Supplementary Table 8). Sensitivity analyses for antibody or overall T cell positivity at two weeks and six months after diagnosis using logistic regression models showed comparable results (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Therefore the severity of disease age and smoking status are all independently associated with the magnitude of immune responses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMTA4MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in brown adipose tissue of obesity-prone and obesity-resistant mice,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222010811 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMTA4MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Eisai is bringing about 800 employees with it to the new head office. The 332800-square-foot facility is located on the ON3 Campus in Nutley New Jersey an old Roche site.

But back when the company announced the move two years ago it said the plan was to transfer up to 1200 U.S. corporate and R&D functions to the new site.

“It’s only always been 800” an Eisai spokesperson told Fierce Pharma. The company had less than 800 staffers at the old Woodcliff Lake site and Eisai is now also bringing together people in the metropolitan New Jersey area the spokesperson added. The site has capacity to house 1300 staffers.

Eisai has been increasing its headcount in North America in the past few years. As of the end of March the company recorded 1982 employees in North America up from 1820 a year ago and 1682 in 2020.

But the company did recently unveil plans to shut down its H3 Biomedicine oncology R&D wing in Massachusetts laying off 88 people stationed there. Besides the corporate headquarters and H3 Eisai also operates a dementia discovery center in Cambridge Massachusetts plus an Exton Pennsylvania facility which holds a biologics plant and a cancer and neurodegenerative disease biologics discovery center.

The relocation comes as Eisai is gearing up for an all-important FDA decision on Biogen-partnered Alzheimer’s candidate lecanemab. The beta-amyloid antibody a follow-up to the pair’s ill-fated Aduhelm is under FDA priority review for a decision by Jan. 6 2023.

After a negative Medicare coverage decision that basically nixed Aduhelm’s commercial prospects at least for the next few years Eisai in March handed its partial stake in Aduhelm to Biogen to focus on lecanemab on which the Japanese pharma is taking the lead.

In preparation for lecanemab’s potential rollout Eisai recently brought on former Eli Lilly exec Thomas Fagan Jr. to the new role of vice president U.S. Alzheimer’s disease commercial. It’s not immediately clear how big an Alzheimer’s commercial team Eisai is building.

While Eisai is anticipating an accelerated approval based on biomarker data the 1795-subject phase 3 Clarity AD trial is expected to read out how lecanemab could slow dementia symptoms in this September. If successful the results could support a full approval.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) only covers beta-amyloid antibodies cleared under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway when they are used in a clinical trial setting. Eisai has already started discussions with the CMS about using data from Clarity AD to enable fast reconsideration for broader access for lecanemab once a full approval comes through Ivan Cheung Eisai’s U.S. head and global neurology business chief said during an investor call two weeks ago.

“Foundational to our launch preparation for lecanemab is building trust with the public about lecanemab’s clinical data and value” Cheung said during the call.

Aiming to avoid some of the mistakes Biogen made with Aduhelm Eisai will publish lecanemab clinical data in a peer-reviewed journal in a timely manner according to Cheung. Biogen was criticized for its delay in disclosing full Aduhelm data from two phase 3 trials and when it finally did in March—nine months after the FDA nod—it chose a small journal.

Without giving Eisai’s final pricing strategy Cheung pointed to an early evaluation of lecanemab’s value suggesting it could potentially be priced up to $38000 a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

No matter how good of a time you have on your trip you tend to remember the not-so-great moments like if your check-in was delayed by two hours forcing you to haul your heavy bags around town or if your room was dirty once you finally arrived at it. While any hotel is bound to have a hiccup or two here and there (it happens) they’re sure to be way fewer and farther between at the best hotels in Chicago. These top-notch accommodations have it all from VIP-level service that will have you feeling like the second coming of Mariah Carey to dining options from Top Chef-worthy restaurants (really though Stephanie Izard is the executive chef at The Hoxton’s Cabra). They also boast the kind of amenities that will have your jaw on the floor (have you seen the Four Seasons' pool?).

According to a press release from Nammo during the June 28 test at the Andoya Test Center in Norway a Boeing Ramjet 155 projectile was fired out of a cannon and its ramjet engine ignited successfully. It demonstrated flight stability with a well-controlled engine combustion process.

“We believe the Boeing Ramjet 155 with continued technology maturation and testing can help the U.S. Army meet its long-range precision fires modernization priorities” said Steve Nordlund Boeing Phantom Works vice president and general manager. “This successful test is evidence that we are making great progress.”

“This is a historic moment for Nammo” said Nammo Chief Executive Officer Morten Brandtzæg. “The test results demonstrate that ramjets are viable and can fundamentally change the future of artillery.

“We have great confidence in the ramjet concept” Brandtzæg added. “The test – with all aspects from cannon firing to the projectile body fins and trajectory all functioning perfectly – represents a real technological breakthrough in artillery and a major success for Boeing Nammo and the U.S. Army.”

The long-range test at Andøya follows years of research development and testing by Boeing and Nammo of ramjet technology including more than 450 static or short-range tests.

Boeing Phantom Works and Nammo have been working together under a strategic partnership to jointly develop and produce the next generation of boosted artillery projectiles. In July 2019 the Boeing-Nammo team was awarded a contract under the U.S. Army’s XM1155 program to develop and mature the Ramjet 155 projectile. In May 2021 the team was awarded a Phase II technology development contract.

Ramjet 155 uses an engine in which the air drawn in for combustion is compressed solely by the forward motion of the projectile at supersonic speeds. Considered a hybrid between guided artillery and missiles the program has an objective of a common round design that can be used in L39 and L58 cannons.

This company which is in the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20.83%.

For the most recent quarter Brown-Forman B was expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share but it reported $0.31 per share instead representing a surprise of 29.17%. For the previous quarter the consensus estimate was $0.48 per share while it actually produced $0.54 per share a surprise of 12.50%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Brown-Forman B estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Brown-Forman B currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.03% which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 31 2022.

Investors should note however that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

From American Express and Capital One to various U.S. airlines and unique Priority Pass options this airport is chock-full of great choices that range from standard airport lounges to private napping suites and even a video game room.

So if you find yourself on a layover with time to spare in Dallas you're in luck. Depending on your lounge access credentials (many popular rewards credit cards can get you in) you could spend an entire afternoon lounge hopping. But maybe you need to just pick the best lounge for your situation and set up shop.

Either way TPG has you covered. Four TPG staffers flew through Dallas on various trips and collectively sampled 13 different DFW lounges thanks to access provided by their credit cards or elite status.

Here we break down the experience in each lounge in an effort to help you find which is best for your next trip.

Capital One Lounge (near D22)

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

The Capital One Lounge in DFW — near Gate D22 and in the same part of the concourse as the American Airlines Flagship Lounge — opened in late 2021. It offers great hot and grab-and-go food a full bar and ample seating. If that sounds idyllic for an airport lounge it pretty much is.

On the day TPG's Summer Hull visited in early December 2021 there was a small event going on to allow some airport staff to experience the lounge. But even with that event the space wasn't overcrowded or the food picked over in any way.

There are multiple different sitting areas in a horseshoe around the center of the lounge where the individual small plates are located. The Capital One Lounge also offers a Peloton room a relaxation room and a shower suite.

While the physical space is quite nice it's the food and beverages that make the Capital One Lounge incredibly tough for its competitors to beat — or even meet.

From macaroni and cheese with bacon to bibimbap a beet salad brownies and a chicken pot pie there were ample selections for in-lounge culinary enjoyment.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 10 Food available at the Capital One lounge at DFW. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

If you need to just grab something to eat on the go you can do that too. There's an assortment of sandwiches salads yogurts beverages and more available near the entrance.

How to get access to the Capital One Lounge

Anyone can pay $65 for a lounge visit. But better yet the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card or Capital One Spark Miles for Business will get you two complimentary lounge visits per calendar year. Additional visits can be purchased for $45 apiece if you have one of those cards and have used up your two included annual visits.

If you want to be a frequent Capital One Lounge visitor however you'll probably want the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card which gets you and up to two guests per visit unlimited access.

Finally note that several airlines partner with the Capital One Lounge to offer lounge access to select premium cabin and elite passengers.

American Airlines Admirals Club (near D24)

(Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy)

From small to huge American Airlines Admirals Clubs tend to offer consistency. And American has an Admirals Club in every DFW terminal. Near the end of 2021 TPG's Katie Genter visited the Admirals Club near Gate D24 to check out this lounge's offerings.

There is ample seating including typical lounge seating bar seating desk seating with office chairs table seating and a TV room. There is also a small children's room.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 10 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Like all Admirals Clubs this location offers complimentary snacks and drinks and a full-service bar.

During her visit afternoon snacks were offered including soups a mezze selection spinach and artichoke dip naan bread salads cheese cubes snack mixes and a selection of desserts. There was also more substantial food and higher-quality drinks available for purchase from a menu.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

This lounge also offers complimentary Wi-Fi. During her visit the Wi-Fi tested at 9.94 Mbps download and 10.07 Mbps upload speeds. And Katie reports there were an adequate number of toilet stalls and sinks in the women's restroom.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

However Katie only stayed in the Admirals Club for about an hour before heading to the nearby Capital One Lounge. She likes the Capital One Lounge due to its meal-worthy complimentary dining options and smaller crowds (at least for now).

How to get access to the Admirals Club

You can access all Admirals Clubs with the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® (see rates and fees) as long as you're flying American that same day. Plus you can bring up to two guests if they are also flying American.

Alternatively you can buy a single-visit pass for $79 or 7900 miles. Or if you plan to visit Admirals Clubs frequently you can buy an Admirals Club membership. Annual membership rates vary based on your current AAdvantage elite status and whether you are a new member or a renewing member. But rates start at $700 for an individual membership and $1500 for a household membership.

Finally Oneworld elite members and passengers in premium cabins may get access when flying on qualifying itineraries. See this page on American's website for more details.

American Airlines Admirals Club (between C19 and C20)

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

TPG's Clint Henderson took a tour of the Admirals Club in Terminal C and called it ""a full throwback to the 1990s."" Henderson said ""The Terminal C space looks like the lounges from the '90s movie 'Up in the Air.'""

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 14 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

The lounge is massive and didn't feel too crowded but Clint said he felt a bit ripped off paying $59 for a one-day pass. That's because the food offerings were pretty grim. You'll find reheated soups cheese cubes carrots celery a spinach dip and some prepackaged side salads. There are also apples and oranges wrapped in cellophane.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 22 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

The one thing the food offerings do have going for them is the trays of cookies. Honorable mention goes to the chef bar where you can get guacamole and chips during certain hours of the day though this wasn't available when Clint visited.

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

The other thing people like about this lounge is the bar which is always bustling. In fact there are complaints the lines at the bar can be exceedingly long though that wasn't the case when Clint was there.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1

Service wasn't especially friendly but the agents at the check-in counter were nice. If you like space this is the lounge for you with multiple seating areas and styles of seats (no lie-flat couches though).

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Wi-Fi is lightning fast clocking in at 19.5 Mbps for downloads and 19.3 Mbps for uploads.

(Screenshot from speedtest.net)

There is also a large business center with private booths for working and even a printer with a fax machine (I love the '90s!). We do love the Eames-style lounge chairs though the rest of the furniture is pretty dated.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Clint said ""I'd skip this lounge next time and head instead to the one in Terminal D – American's premium lounge offering and a nicer experience overall.""

American Airlines Admirals Club (between B3 and B4)

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

Katie visited the Admirals Club in Terminal B between gates B3 and B4 in June 2022. This lounge is near where the walkway from Terminal D reaches Terminal B. If you're looking for tucked-away quiet cubicles to work in the Terminal B Admirals Club may provide just what you need.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

The rest of the seating is in one large room with a raised ceiling. But the seating feels packed in and the space is rather dark.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

There's a bar at the end of the large room. The drink options are similar to what you'd find in most Admirals Clubs — plenty of house drinks to choose from as well as some premium options that carry a surcharge.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

Just before you get to the bar there's a selection of snacks in a corner. There are the same snacks Clint and Katie reported above when they visited other DFW Admirals Clubs in late 2021. There was also a make-your-own taco bar with tortillas ground beef beans cheese lettuce pico de gallo and sour cream at this lounge when Katie visited in June 2022.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 7 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

There is Wi-Fi in the lounge. When Katie did a speed test in the business center she found 9.90 Mbps download and 9.91 Mbps upload speeds. There are also several conference rooms you can rent and spacious bathrooms. However you should know that there's no kids room.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Like Clint and the Terminal C Admirals Club Katie would recommend skipping the Terminal B Admirals Club in favor of the one in Terminal D (or the Centurion Lounge American Flagship Lounge or Capital One Lounge if you have access to any of these).

American Airlines Flagship Lounge (between D21 and D22)

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

The American Airlines Flagship Lounge in Dallas reopened in March 2022 after closing during the coronavirus pandemic. This lounge is located in Terminal D between gates D21 and D22 adjacent to the Capital One Lounge.

The lounge is huge with many different types of seating. Near the entrance you'll find the buffet and a variety of tables and counters appropriate for eating or working. Katie says she particularly enjoys the counters by the window which offer views of the tarmac.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

Speaking of the buffet American's Flagship Lounges offer a buffet of similar quality to Amex Centurion lounges but with a much wider variety. You'll find sushi before the flights to Asia depart and Katie loved the housemade chips. The buffet is designed for travelers to have a meal not just a snack.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 American Airlines Flagship Lounge in Dallas. KATIE GENTER/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3 4

There's also a huge drink selection — and it's all self-serve (besides the Champagne station as you enter the lounge which is usually staffed). Whether you want to drink coffee sparkling water wine Champagne or a mixed drink it's all available here.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Walking farther into the lounge you'll find quads of chairs by the windows the Flagship First Dining room a counter of workstations with dividers between the seats a staffed customer service desk shower rooms bathrooms a snack bar a video room and a quiet room.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 13 KATIE GENTER/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

Whether you want to take a nap relax or work you'll likely find a spot that works well for you. And best of all there are power outlets at almost every seat in the lounge. Katie tested the Wi-Fi during her June 2020 visit and found 9.97 Mbps download and 9.89 Mbps upload speeds.

Katie says she has trouble choosing between the Capital One Lounge and American's Flagship Lounge when flying through Dallas and has access to both. She gives a slight edge to the Flagship Lounge since it has better working space self-serve drinks and a wider variety of food. But it's much more feasible for most travelers to access the Capital One Lounge than the Flagship Lounge.

How to get access to the American Airlines Flagship Lounge

Unlike the other lounges discussed in this story there's no way to get American Airlines Flagship Lounge access as a credit card benefit.

But you can purchase access for $150 or 15000 AAdvantage miles per person at open Flagship Lounge locations if space permits. You can only purchase a single-visit pass if you are 21 years of age or older and are traveling the same day on a flight marketed or operated by American or marketed and operated by any Oneworld airline.

You may also have access when flying on select first- or business-class tickets. American Airlines AAdvantage and Alaska MileagePlan elite members have access when traveling on select itineraries while other Oneworld Sapphire and Emerald members get access before and after any same-day flight marketed and operated by American or a Oneworld airline. The Flagship Lounge access policies are nuanced so check out all the specifics on American's website.

Finally note that Flagship First Dining is an even more exclusive perk than Flagship Lounge access. So don't get these two exclusive perks confused.

Minute Suites (near D23)

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Minutes Suites aren't a traditional airport lounge but one is an option in DFW if you need a quiet private place away from the gate to take a nap make a call nurse a baby or just stream something on your device without distractions.

Food and beverages aren't included here but basic pre-packaged beverages chips granola bars and similar are available for purchase with prices ranging from $2 to $4 for most selections. You can access items either at the front desk or via the minibar in your private room.

During Summer's late-2021 visit there was no wait to get in and the internet speed was 79.3 Mbps download and 7.72 Mbps upload.

Summer found the Minute Suites delivered on the promise of some quiet private space. But the space felt a little dark dated and not somewhere you'd want to hang out for hours on end unless you need a nap or privacy away from the crowds.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

How to get access to Minute Suites

You can pay $48 for one hour of quiet in the Minute Suites with additional 15-minute periods costing $12 each. Nursing and pumping mothers can get a free 30-minute visit.

However anyone with a Priority Pass card — available with many premium credit cards — can enjoy an hour at Minute Suites for no extra charge with additional hours available at a discounted rate of $34. Up to three guests can enjoy the same suite as the Priority Pass member at no charge.

The Club DFW (near D27)

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

The Club DFW is a Priority Pass option in Terminal D. It's a small lounge with three seating areas: a bar/buffet area a quiet room and an ""outdoor"" area that has a view of the terminal. The bar area was very crowded during my midday visit in December 2021 while the quiet room had plenty of open seating.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

As for food options there was a buffet area near the check-in counter with a variety of breakfast options as well as coffee juice and soft drinks. The buffet wasn't self-serve when I visited so travelers needed to ask a buffet attendant to make a plate for them. Unfortunately there were no to-go options.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

There is a bar too which has a variety of beer wine and liquor options.

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

My only major issue with The Club was the check-in time. It took over five minutes for an attendant to greet the growing line of patrons waiting to enter with Priority Pass cards. I chalked this up to the lounge being short-staffed as my visit was around the same time the omicron wave started.

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

How to get access to The Club DFW

You can access The Club with a Priority Pass membership or pay a daily rate for access. When I visited access was offered for $33 per day which was advertised as a 25% discount on the standard daily rate. However The Club DFW is now selling single visits online for $48.71.

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

Finally note The Club DFW only allows access at most three hours before your flight's scheduled departure.

American Express Centurion Lounge (near D12)

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

The American Express Centurion Lounge at DFW is located in Terminal D and is one of the larger Amex lounges around having benefited from a space upgrade a few years ago. As is true with many Amex lounges there was a long line to get into the lounge when I stopped by although luckily I didn't have to join a waitlist.

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

Seating is plentiful around the lounge although seats fill up quickly during peak periods. You'll find couches tables and high-tops scattered around the lounge. While there are no tarmac views you do get a sweeping view of the inside of the terminal.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 7 (Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Everything in the lounge was what you'd expect from an Amex Centurion Lounge if you've been to one in the past. There was a large buffet which included favorites like scrambled eggs pancakes and granola for breakfast. There were also self-serve espresso and water machines around the lounge. There were no takeaway food options when I visited.

Effective February 1 2025: Eligible Platinum Card Members will receive 10 Visits per Eligible Platinum Card per year to the Delta Sky Club or to Grab and Go when traveling on a same-day Delta-operated flight.

Be Relax Spa (near B28)

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

There is a Be Relax Spa in Terminal B near Gate B28 that you can access with Priority Pass memberships that aren't a perk of American Express cards.

Similar to the Gameway location discussed later in this story the Be Relax Spa isn't a typical lounge. Instead it's a location where you get a spa service and then leave. The Priority Pass website states that you can get one of the following complimentary treatments during your visit:

Be Back 30-minute massage.

Be Back 15-minute massage plus aromatherapy and oxygen.

Head Up on lounger 10-minute massage plus aromatherapy and oxygen.

Be Feet on lounger 10-minute massage plus aromatherapy and oxygen.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

When Katie visited in June 2022 the spa staff originally told her that only the massage chairs were available through Priority Pass. But when she specifically asked about the foot and head massages mentioned on the Priority Pass website the staff member said the location wasn't offering foot massages because the chair was broken. And it would be a two-hour wait for a head massage.

Katie said the wait wasn't an issue so the staff asked her to write her name desired treatment flight boarding time and phone number on a sheet of paper. About 90 minutes later she got a call asking if she'd still like to get a treatment with her Priority Pass benefit.

(Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy)

Once at the Be Relax Spa the staff swiped her Priority Pass card led her to a massage chair and asked her to remove her shoes. The staff member warned her that some people find the massage chair too rough saying to speak up if she wanted him to turn off the chair. Then the staff member turned on the massage chair and gave Katie a 10-minute head massage.

The head massage was relaxing. And unlike other massage chairs she'd tried this one didn't leave her feeling bruised. After experiencing the massage chair she'd be more likely to try the 30-minute massage chair session on a subsequent visit instead of waiting for a head or foot massage.

Before you visit check the hours on the Be Relax Spa website as they may be shorter in reality than the Priority Pass website or app would lead you to believe. For example when Katie visited in June 2022 the spa closed at 6 p.m. even though the Priority Pass website said the spa would be open until 9 p.m. Finally although there is also a Be Relax Spa in DFW Terminal D that location doesn't participate in Priority Pass.

How to get access to the Be Relax Spa

You can pay for spa services at the Be Relax Spa based on the stated menu of prices. But if you have a Priority Pass membership that isn't from an Amex card — since Priority Passes from American Express cards only cover typical lounge visits — you can choose from a selection of complimentary offerings as a benefit of your Priority Pass visit.

United Club (between E6 and E7)

Terminal D has the widest array of lounge options at DFW. But if you find yourself in Terminal E you still have choices.

One option is the United Club which rings in at the smaller and more basic level of United Clubs. However there are a few different seating areas a bar and a couple of small private rooms to take calls or work.

The day Summer visited this lounge it got pretty busy for the available space. And the food options — such as vegetable soup and a platter of corn dog nuggets — were not the most appetizing especially after she'd seen what was on offer at the Capital One Lounge.

The complimentary WiFi clocked in at 109.7 Mbps download and 126.6 Mbps upload.

As long as you come in with tempered expectations for the offerings and amenities the United Club can do the trick if you are looking for a lounge option in this terminal.

How to get access to the United Club

The United Club Infinite Card includes unlimited United Club visits when you're flying with United or other Star Alliance partners. Other United cobranded credit cards like the United Business Card include two United Club one-time passes per year which you can use when flying on a United-operated flight.

Premium-cabin passengers Star Alliance Gold members active U.S. military personnel Air Canada Maple Leaf Club members and Virgin Australia Velocity Frequent Flyer members may also have access when flying on select itineraries. See this page on United's website for more details.

Gameway (near E16)

Another option in Terminal E that isn't quite a lounge but is still an entertaining way to pass the time between flights is Gameway.

This Gameway location offers almost two dozen stations each with a PlayStation 4 Pro that's loaded with a variety of games for you to pick from. There are also snacks candy and bottled beverages available.

How to get access to Gameway

You can pay $16 for an hour at Gameway or you can get in ""for free.""

The Priority Pass membership you may already have available to you via credit cards such as the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card Chase Sapphire Reserve® and Citi Prestige® Card (no longer open for new applicants) provides not only two hours of gaming but also one beverage and two included snacks.

The information for the Citi Prestige has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Note that just like how the Priority Pass memberships available through American Express cards aren't eligible for restaurant use — even when those issued by other banks are — the same is true for options like Gameway. So be sure to produce a Priority Pass membership from the right credit card.

Delta Sky Club (between E10 and E11)

Also in the E gates is the Delta Sky Club. The lounge is surprisingly large for a Sky Club at a non-Delta hub with a bar buffet area and two seating areas. You'll find one seating area right behind the bar with sweeping tarmac views that make for great planespotting.

There are also plenty of chairs toward the front of the lounge although this area is a bit dark especially in the early morning.

There are a wide variety of seating options including large comfy chairs to lounge tables and chairs to work and high-top seating ideal for enjoying a pre-flight beverage. The morning I visited this lounge it was relatively busy but there were plenty of open seats to relax.

Food and beverage offerings were standard for a Delta SkyClub — snacks and light eats like packaged sandwiches (for takeaway) fruit salad and chips. You can grab a drink at the bar or enjoy coffee and espresso beverages from the automatic espresso machine at the front of the lounge.

How to get access to the Delta Sky Club

One popular way to access the Delta Sky Club is using The Platinum Card from American Express or The Business Platinum Card from American Express. Both cards offer Sky Club access for cardholders with a same-day Delta boarding pass (limited to six annual visits from Feb. 1 2025).

The Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card and Delta SkyMiles® Reserve Business American Express Card both provide Sky Club memberships. Effective 2/1/25 Reserve Card Members will receive 15 Visits per year to the Delta Sky Club; to earn an unlimited number of Visits each year starting on 2/1/25 the total eligible purchases on the Card must equal $75000 or more between 1/1/24 and 12/31/24 and each calendar year thereafter.

Plaza Premium Lounge (near E31)

(Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy)

The Plaza Premium Lounge is located in Terminal E near Gate E31. Katie visited this lounge in June 2022 shortly after Capital One added Plaza Premium lounge access for select cardmembers.

The lounge itself is very small consisting of just one room the size of a small airport restaurant. The lounge was relatively full when Katie visited so she opted to sit at the bar and work on her laptop.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

The complimentary house drink menu is relatively extensive. There are two beers on tap (Coors Light and Lone Star) so Katie went with a Lone Star in memory of when she lived in Texas.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The food on the other hand is lacking compared with other Plaza Premium lounges Katie has visited (and with the Capital One and Centurion lounges at DFW). There's a self-serve snack area with oranges bagged pretzels cookies and apples on one side of the bar. And there are some self-serve cold foods on the other side of the bar as well as a hot meal of the day and soup that the bartender can serve you. During Katie's visit the hot meal of the day was slow-cooked roast beef and smashed red potatoes.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

There's no bathroom or kids room in the lounge. There is Wi-Fi but you'll need to get an activation code on a receipt from the reception agent. A test during Katie's visit showed 5.51 Mbps download and 5.48 Mbps upload speeds. Only about a fourth of the seating in the lounge offered access to power outlets.

Katie overheard another guest saying ""I'm heading to the Centurion Lounge -- I was expecting a bit more here."" And she agrees noting she'd likely only visit again if she could do so for free using a card benefit and she was departing from Terminal E on a short layover.

How to get access to the Plaza Premium Lounge

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy) 0 1

You can pay $25 for a ""limited access"" one-hour pass or $50 for a full-access three-hour pass (the electronic board outside the lounge also advertised a $45 three-hour pass). But unless you're very hungry or thirsty I wouldn't recommend paying these rates.

Luckily now select Capital One cardholders can access Plaza Premium lounges free of charge. However if you have a Capital One card that only allows a set number of lounge visits per year — such as the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card — you may not want to burn your visits at this Plaza Premium Lounge.

Amex Platinum and Centurion cardholders including those with The Platinum Card from American Express or The Business Platinum Card from American Express get complimentary access to this Plaza Premium Lounge.

Bottom line

This isn't an exhaustive list of DFW lounge options. For example we didn't visit the Gameway in Terminal B the Minutes Suites in Terminal B or the Admirals Clubs in Terminal A or Terminal E as these are all lounge types we visited in other DFW terminals.

In short DFW has a lot of lounges that you can access most simply by having select premium travel rewards cards.

If you want to stay close to your gate or have Flagship Lounge access the lounge for your respective airline might be your best bet. But if you're near the D gates — or have a long layover and can hop over — you can enjoy higher-end food and drink at lounges offered by credit card companies like American Express and Capital One.

We found that the Capital One Lounge currently offers the best overall experience with less crowding and more high-quality dining options to either eat in or take to go. However the right lounge for your specific visit will depend on your priorities what cards are in your wallet what elite statuses you hold and the demand for lounge space on that day.

Craving lounge access? Check out our article on the best cards for airport lounges including The Platinum Card from American Express and the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card.

That way on that next (normally dreaded) layover you can live it up playing video games planespotting from the bar or taking a nap -- all at no additional cost to you.

In 2019 government lawyers in Oklahoma called Johnson & Johnson the “kingpin” of the opioid crisis likening the pharmaceutical giant to a Mexican drug cartel.

In 2021 New York’s top law enforcement figure declared that opioids “wreaked havoc on countless communities” and that Johnson & Johnson “helped fuel this fire.”

But Illinois politicians keep taking campaign money from Johnson & Johnson and other companies paying $26 billion to settle lawsuits that accused them of fueling the opioid crisis campaign-finance records show.

Illinois Senate President Don Harmon D-Oak Park is the most prominent among them. Harmon has accepted these campaign contributions tied to the companies that have been painted by government lawyers across the nation as corporate bad guys in the opioid crisis:



$2000 last September from a Johnson & Johnson political action committee.

$2000 in 2020 from a Johnson & Johnson fund.

$2000 in December from Fidelity Consulting Group LLC a Rosemont lobbying firm that lobbies for Johnson & Johnson.

$7500 over the past two years from firms that lobby on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America a Washington D.C. trade group to which Johnson & Johnson and other opioid sellers belong.

Harmon won’t talk about taking campaign contributions from companies linked to the opioid crisis.

Opioid cash won’t ‘compromise his values’

Asked about why he keeps taking that money a spokesman for the Illinois Democrat rather than answering questions says: “Over two decades in office President Harmon has tirelessly fought for progressive policies that make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share lower health care costs for working families and protect consumers from abuse. No donation from any source will ever compromise his values.”

Asked about its political contributions a Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman points to a statement on the company’s website that says: “We do not expect candidates who receive contributions from our employee political action committee or our company to agree with our positions on all or any specific policy issues. Rather we seek to support candidates who recognize the importance of medical innovation in improving lives and that a fair market-based system provides the best environment for continued innovation. We also seek to support candidates who recognize the importance of broad access to quality affordable health care.”

Earlier this year Johnson & Johnson was among four companies that agreed to pay $26 billion to settle lawsuits that accused them of making money off the highly addictive painkillers while ignoring the health and well-being of users.

Hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths nationwide have been reported in recent years including according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 75000 opioid-related deaths from mid-2020 to mid-2021.

In Cook County more than 10000 deaths since 2016 have been linked to opioid overdoses. Statewide the number is nearly 23000 from 2008 through 2021.

Opioid payout coming to Illinois

State governments are among those that stand to get a piece of the $26 billion settlement — with an estimated $760 million destined for Illinois — to put toward drug-abuse treatment and prevention.

At a news conference last month Harmon’s fellow Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker talked about how that money will be handled and called the opioid crisis “one of the most disturbing examples of corporate greed and medical mismanagement in human history.”

Among those involved in the settlement Johnson & Johnson manufactured opioids and Cardinal Health McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen distributed the narcotic painkillers.

Under the settlement each of those companies will pay out billions of dollars. Johnson & Johnson — which like the others who settled rather than face trial hasn’t acknowledged any wrongdoing — also agreed to stop selling opioids in the United States.

Harmon who was elected Senate president in 2020 got a $2000 campaign contribution from McKesson in 2021.

The same year the company also gave $750 to state Rep. Barbara Hernandez D-Aurora. Hernandez who didn’t respond to calls or emails seeking comment was appointed to the Legislature in 2019 when Pritzker tapped her predecessor to head the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

Harmon who’s been in the General Assembly since 2003 accepted $250 from Cardinal Health in 2004 according to Illinois State Board of Elections records that show he’s gotten a total of about $150000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career.

Welch among pols taking opioid-tied money

Campaign-finance records also show:



Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch who assumed that top legislative post in January 2021 accepted a $2000 campaign contribution from Johnson & Johnson in November $1500 in 2020 and $500 in 2019. Welch also got $750 in 2020 from McKesson. Welch and his aides would not answer questions about those contributions.

Altogether since 1994 Illinois politicians’ campaign funds collectively have gotten about $450000 from the four companies involved in the opioid settlement including about $360000 from Johnson & Johnson.

The pharmaceutical research and manufacturers group gave more than $300000 over the past two decades to Illinois politicians including nearly $140000 to campaign funds that were controlled by Welch’s predecessor former House Speaker Michael Madigan. Sarah Sutton a spokeswoman for the trade group says: “We engage with policymakers from both sides of the aisle who have a wide array of health care opinions and priorities.”

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul whose office is overseeing litigation in Illinois against the pharmaceutical industry took a $1000 campaign contribution from the pharma trade group in 2006 and $500 from Johnson & Johnson in 2015 both while he was in the General Assembly. Elected to his current post in 2018 he took contributions during that campaign from pharmaceutical firms including $500 from AbbVie.

AbbVie also gave pols money

Last month AbbVie which is based in North Chicago agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits over how its Allergan unit which it bought in 2020 marketed opioids.

Teva Pharmaceuticals which bought part of Allergan in 2016 announced a settlement agreement last month that could see it pay more than $4 billion to settle claims over opioids.

Harmon has gotten $25000 in campaign contributions from AbbVie since 2013 including $5000 in June and $15000 in 2021 records show.

AbbVie has given Welch $21500 including $5000 in June and $15000 in 2021 records show.

AbbVie which like Teva is a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America the trade group that has given heavily to Illinois politicians gave $1000 to then-state Rep. Christian Mitchell in 2018. After Pritzker took office in early 2019 he named Mitchell as one of his deputy governors.

Mitchell also got a $500 campaign contribution in 2015 from Fidelity Consulting Group. Neither of the lobbyists who run the company returned calls or emails.

Asked about the contributions Mitchell’s response was “Let me talk to my team see if it’s appropriate” to discuss this issue “and get back to you.” He didn’t.

Fidelity gave $1000 in 2021 to state Rep. Robyn Gabel D-Evanston who also got $500 from Johnson & Johnson in December.

Gabel also took $500 in 2016 from Purdue Pharma. The company long run by members of the billionaire Sackler family pleaded guilty in 2007 and 2020 to criminal charges stemming from marketing practices that “downplayed” the addiction risks of the opioid OxyContin.

Gabel has worked in public health for years.

“I’ve worked with pharmaceutical companies around immunization issues for many years for children’s immunizations” Gabel says. “So they throw me a little bit of money once in a while.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5oYnIuY29tL25oLW90aGVyLXN0YXRlcy1yZWFjaC00NTBtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1hbm90aGVyLW9waW9pZC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NH other states reach $450m settlement with another opioid manufacturer,"New Hampshire is one of 34 states that has reached a $450 million settlement with Endo an Ireland-based drugmaker over its marketing and promotion efforts related to opioids.

In the agreement Endo International plc which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday night in the Southern District of New York resolves allegations that it used deceptive marketing of Opana ER and downplayed the risk of addiction and overstated the benefits.

The states along with the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands allege that Endo falsely promoted the benefits of Opana ER’s so-called abuse-deterrent formulation which they said did nothing to deter oral abuse and led to deadly outbreaks of hepatitis and HIV due to its widespread abuse via injection. Opana ER was withdrawn from the market in 2017.

The agreement requires payment of $450 million in cash over 10 years to participating states and subdivisions. It also requires the company to turn over its opioid-related documents for publication online in a public document archive and pay $2.75 million for archival expenses. Finally it bans the marketing of Endo’s opioids forever.

New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said “The states allege that Endo falsely promoted the benefits of Opana ER’s so-called abuse-deterrent formulation which did nothing to deter oral abuse and led to deadly outbreaks of Hepatitis and HIV due to its widespread abuse via injection.”

Formella added that the newest settlement “continues our efforts over many years to hold opioid manufacturers distributors and dispensers responsible for their role in fueling the opioid crisis in New Hampshire.”

The state has filed several complaints related to the ongoing opioid crisis. The most recent came in July when the AG’s office filed a complaint against the nation’s three largest pharmacy chains CVS Walgreens and Rite Aid over their opioid related distribution and dispensing practices.

New Hampshire previously filed complaints against opioid manufacturers Purdue Pharma and Mallinckrodt. Both also filed for bankruptcy protection. The Mallinckrodt bankruptcy plan under which New Hampshire will receive payments has been confirmed by the court. The Purdue bankruptcy plan is awaiting court confirmation.

The state also filed complaints against national opioid distributors McKesson Corp Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen. Those cases were resolved when participating states reached a settlement with the companies that will provide the state with some $115 million over 18 years. And a case filed against opioid manufacturer Johnson & Johnson is scheduled for trial in early September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZHJ1Z3N0b3JlbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi1uYWNkcy10b3RhbC1zdG9yZS1leHBvLXByb2R1Y3Qtc2hvd2Nhc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 NACDS Total Store Expo product showcase,"Liquid I.V.

But Soca & Associates is seemingly no more Misfit has pulled out and Branches is missing its first ever Carnival since the event started 49 years ago. At the heart of many of the absences is the long-running strife between bandleaders and the Caribbean American Carnival Association of Boston (CACAB) which presents Boston Carnival billed as the largest BIPOC celebration in Massachusetts. The conflict comes down to the leadership of CACAB’s president Shirley Shillingford. Shillingford who has been at the helm of CACAB almost continuously since 1990 has weathered her share of controversies fending off everything from lawsuits by disgruntled board members seeking financial records to complaints that she and her daughter were pictured on billboards advertising Boston Carnival.

Detractors bemoan her management and communication style and say under her watch Carnival has failed to be transparent or live up to its potential as a major tourist draw. Supporters say the politically-connected Shillingford a one-time aide to former Boston Mayor Kevin White and the manager of a Boston Public Health Commission food pantry in Mattapan has the fundraising and permitting know-how required for such a large undertaking. The CACAB’s advisory committee includes Rep. Ayanna Pressley and former state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson who is seeking to regain the seat she lost after a 2010 bribery conviction.

Danielle ""Ms. Hot Sauce'' Johnson the morning show host and owner of digital radio station SparkFM put up an online petition calling for new Carnival leadership that has garnered over 700 signatures and says many bands are boycotting the 2022 parades. “There have been debates and conflicts for such a long time. Carnival hasn’t evolved in the last 20 years” says Johnson who grew up with Carnival when her uncles were part of the Tempo International Rhythm Section and helps lead the Sauce J'ouvert band. Johnson says neither Tempo nor Sauce will be on the road and that other beloved groups like LaBoue aka Mudd Band will also be missing. She says CACAB is creating confusion by listing some of the boycotting bands in its Carnival promotion.

Johnson says she attempted to organize an alternative to the CACAB parade but was told no permits would be granted for another event in the area that weekend. If there aren’t changes at the CACAB Johnson says she’ll try to convince local officials to give her group a chance to show “what Carnival can be if we work intergenerationally.”

Carl Smith who leads Branches and has been part of the steel band since 1978 says his organization supports the boycott. Smith is a former CACAB vice president and was on the board until last year when he and Shillingford exchanged harshly worded letters each accusing the other of misconduct during meetings.

“If she goes we’ll be back at Carnival. If she stays we won’t be” says Smith. Branches is a Boston institution that has taught generations of youth the steel pan tradition. Smith says the group is staying busy with appearances at venues like Faneuil Hall and its annual picnic on Sept. 18. Of Shillingford Smith says “she thinks the Carnival belongs to her but it doesn’t. It belongs to the community.”

Even some of the bands that are participating in the 2022 festivities say they want to see a change. “Honestly the only reason I’m on the road is that I already have so much money invested” says Andrea Mercury the bandleader of Boston Socaholics one of the last of the pretty mas bands whose elaborate feathered and jeweled costumes were once synonymous with Carnival.

“This was supposed to be a spectacular year we were all excited to get back out and then everything fell apart” bemoans Mercury. Carnival mas bands typically rely on individual revelers to pay to register for a spot in the band’s procession with registrants given the band’s costume or T-shirt. Mercury says that registrations are a fraction of what they normally would be this close to Carnival and with inflation the costs of everything from the rhinestones that make the costumes glitter to the flatbed trucks that roll down Blue Hill Avenue have skyrocketed.

“I’ve reached out to the Carnival committee on several occasions pleading my cause and asking for support and each time I get rejected by them” says Mercury who says she isn’t sure if the lower registration rate is the result of post-COVID economics declining interest CACAB politics “or a combination of all of those things.”

E-mails and calls to Shillingford weren’t returned but CACAB public relations officer Ruth Georges spoke to WBUR on behalf of the board. Georges says the board tasked with raising the six-figure sum needed to mount the parades has never been in the business of subsidizing bands. “We are responsible for getting permits for making all of the events of the Carnival happen for the police detail and getting money to pay for those things.”

Georges says that CACAB is now helping Socaholics with cash and a costume giveaway contest. Asked about the number of Boston mas bands that are no longer on the road she points to the absence this year of Soca & Associates. “Their leadership decided not to continue the band and that had nothing to do with Boston Carnival. If a band doesn’t continue often it’s not because the band is not doing well but because in small organizations and businesses unless you have a legacy and a transition plan the organization can fall by the wayside.”

Georges says the Junior Carnival happening Sunday Aug. 21 is being expanded to include a youth DJ contest as part of efforts to make the events more appealing to the next generation. She points to the 7000 online registrants for a Carnival kickoff event at Carson Beach and says plans are underway for expanded events to mark next year’s 50th anniversary.

One of the most constant themes in the criticisms of Shillingford and the CACAB board comes down to tone and respect. “There’s a new generation of band leaders and there might be some contexts that the bands are not aware of and they project their frustration to the board” says Georges.

While Boston Carnival may seem like an unstoppable tradition so did Boston’s Pride Parade. But the board that ran Boston Pride dissolved amidst criticism — much of it leveled by younger members of the LGBTQ community — in 2021 and no large-scale parade was held this year.

One thing that all sides in the Carnival debate agree on is that the event is vital to Boston’s Caribbean American community. “I live for Carnival” says Mercury. “I just hope and pray that everything goes well and we can get back to doing what we do for the culture.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvY3J1aXNlcy8yMDIyLzA4LzE4L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1zZWNvbmQtcm9sbGVyLWNvYXN0ZXItc2VhLzc4MzI3NjcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise prepares a second roller coaster at sea for passengers,"Calling all adrenaline junkies: Carnival Cruise Line is readying its second BOLT: Ultimate Sea Coaster ride for passengers with test runs taking place this week the cruise line said.

The line will unveil the attraction on its new Carnival Celebration ship which is set to debut this fall after construction is finished at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland. The original BOLT the first roller coaster at sea is on Celebration's sister ship Mardi Gras.

""The recognition this incredible attraction has received since its debut on our flagship last year highlights the tremendous work that went into making it a reality but the most important thing about BOLT is simply it’s fun"" Carnival president Christine Duffy said in a news release. ""It embodies the great lengths we’ll go to for our guests’ good time and I’m eager to see this next coaster in service when Carnival Celebration begins sailing.""

What is BOLT?

On the electric roller coaster guests can ride in a two-person car that speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The attraction boasts 800 feet of winding track – complete with drops – more than 180 feet over the water.

The ride's second iteration was originally put together at Maurer Rides in Munich where early testing was done. The ride was later assembled again in Finland on top of the ship.

""At Maurer we build and deliver excitement and we will deliver just that when BOLT debuts on Carnival Celebration"" Maurer Rides project manager Marco Hartwig said in the release. ""We can’t wait to present this breathtaking ride to Carnival’s guests.""

What can guests expect from Carnival Celebration?

Celebration is the cruise line's second Excel-class ship. Starting with its inaugural sailing on Nov. 21 the vessel will feature seven-day Caribbean voyages all year. The ship will have 17 passenger decks and a ""normal guest occupancy"" of 5282 based on double occupancy Carnival spokesperson Matt Lupoli told USA TODAY in an email.

Celebration will also be powered by cleaner-burning liquefied natural gas.

The shipyard uses a process called the block construction method where the vessel is put together using different blocks of steel. These form huge parts of the vessel including the bridge which was fitted on Friday.

Also the huge engine room block arrived in the shipyard from Rostock Germany this week and will be fitted as soon as another Excel-class ship P&O Cruises’ Arvia moves to the next stage of her build.

Carnival Jubilee Engine Room to Be Fitted This Week

The modern manner in which ships are being built is certainly something that surprises at times. This week the construction of Carnival Jubilee received a number of updates pushing the build time along with German precision.

Carnival Jubilee is being constructed at the Meyer Werft in Papenburg Germany and while the cutting of the first steel and the laying of the keel is only a few weeks ago the vessel is already looking like a cruise ship. The bridge wings were installed earlier today and at the same time the FERU unit arrived in the shipyard.

The FERU unit or Floating Engine Room Unit is equally as important as the bridge section of the vessel. It houses the power units that will propel the 180000 gross tons cruise ship forward. The unit was constructed at the Neptun shipyard in Rostock Germany and towed to the Meyer Werft some 400 kilometers away.

In the near future the FERU unit will be joined to the Carnival Jubilee structure. However before that happens the P&O Arvia a sister ship to Carnival Jubilee which is also currently under construction will be moving to the outfitting stage of construction.

Although the images already make her look as striking as her sisters Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration construction on Carnival Jubilee will take another year at least.

The Ninth and Last Excellence-Class Cruise Ship

Carnival Jubilee will be the ninth and last of the Excel-class cruise ships when she sets sail. The groundbreaking class of ships has been a game-changer in the cruise industry both in terms of low environmental impact due to them being LNG-powered as well as facilities and features such as the BOLT roller coaster.

Besides Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration there are excellence-class ships sailing for Costa Cruises Costa Smeralda and Costa Toscana; P&O Cruises Iona and Arvia; and AIDA AIDAnova and AIDAcosma.

Originally scheduled to sail for AIDA Cruises last year Carnival Corporation decided to transfer the Carnival Jubilee to Carnival Cruise Line. Given the huge success Carnival Cruise Line had with Mardi Gras and the excitement that is building over Carnival Celebration this came as no surprise.

Jubilee is the first Excel-class ship for Carnival being built in Germany; her sisterships were both constructed at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland. Carnival Jubilee is scheduled for her first cruise in November of next year from Galveston Texas.

Christine Duffy Carnival Cruise Line’s President: “Our plans for Texas are as big as the state itself and we’re looking forward to bringing guests aboard our third Excel-class ship that will be just as magnificent as her sister ships Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration.

Biden went on to castigate shipping companies for hiking prices and promised to take an action aimed at reducing the cost of inflation.

Biden was only the latest in a growing number of critics citing the staggering profits of the large shipping companies over the past two years. With companies such as Maersk reporting the largest profit ever in 2021 for any Danish company the focus on profits has continued. While most of the focus was on how the companies were making staggering profits as long-term contracts and spot freight rates jumped to exorbitant levels some commentators started to focus on the taxes paid by the shipping companies.

For a long time shipping companies have enjoyed favorable tax terms. The carriers are taxed based on their tonnage referred to as tonnage tax which is different from the normal corporate tax system.

Thus in most instances many shipping carriers pay no corporate income tax. But even in situations where the corporate is charged it is still way below that of other sectors. For example the average corporate income tax of bulk carriers is 6 percent and just 3 percent for the tanker sector which if contrasted with the 27 percent charged to freight forwarders appears outrageous.

However since the pandemic began the shipping industry has become lucrative. The ocean carriers are now moving massive volumes of cargo while at the same time posting eye-watering profits. Estimates for 2021 set the profits for the industry anywhere between a low of $110 billion to $150 billion or even $200 billion.

As a result the discourse to reappraise the carriers’ tax regime is growing. Taking note of the matter Sea-Intelligence in its weekly report said the present tonnage tax system creates a risk for big shipping players.

“The problem for the carriers right now is that the disparity between their present profits and their low tax rates has become extreme” wrote the analysts at Sea-Intelligence. “Add into the mix that the carriers are politically seen as being part of driving inflation even though not to the degree that some might believe. Add on top of that the very real emotional impact…that in the middle of a continuing supply chain crisis the providers of exceedingly unreliable services are seen to profit like never before.”

With Maersk posting a profit of $8.6 billion and Hapag Lloyd $4.4 billion for Q2 2022 Sea-Intelligence goes further to predict that the political headwind against the carriers is poised to increase.

In the case of Maersk they are going to pay $164 million in taxes for the second quarter of 2022. This is a rate of 1.8 percent. Hapag Lloyd is going to pay $20.9 million meaning an effective tax rate of 0.5 percent.

Confronted by a sagging economy and soaring inflation rates some French politicians were the first to take on the issue proposing a 25 percent windfall tax on the “super profits” earned by the domestic carrier CMA CGM along with other French giants including TotalEnergies and Engie. According to the lawmakers the windfall tax money would have helped to fund measures aimed at protecting consumers’ purchasing power.

CMA CGM’s CEO Rodolphe Saade argued with the politicians saying they needed to look at the company’s competition and the financial disadvantage they would be placed under with the windfall tax. In the end CMA CGM and Total both agreed to reduce prices for French customers to avoid the tax.

Globally politicians in the developed world have pushed for the first global minimum tax on multinational corporations. While some analysts agree that there is a need for a global minimum corporate tax especially applicable to the big ocean carriers some caution that a wrong political answer to the tax question could have a devastating outcome.

Unlike other industries ocean carriers’ business model is quite volatile and depends on a range of factors spread across the world. Further there is global pressure on the shipping industry to invest large sums to address emissions and achieve decarbonization of a sector that many considered one of the most difficult to decarbonize. There are already reports showing the shipping market may start to contract in 2023 meaning the revenues might fall before a consensus on the tax issue is reached.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpdHNhcHN1bi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzE5L25hdnktd29udC1zY3JhcC1mb3JtZXItZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJyaWVyLXB1Z2V0LXNvdW5kLzc4NDU1MTIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navy won't scrap former Enterprise aircraft carrier in Puget Sound,"BREMERTON — The Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is too busy maintaining the active Navy fleet to scrap the former Enterprise aircraft carrier Navy officials announced Friday.

Instead the ""Big E"" the Navy's first nuclear-powered flattop will head for a private scrapyard somewhere in the American South for disposal under plans outlined in a draft environmental impact statement.

More:The Navy wants to demolish Puget Sound Naval Shipyard's iconic shipyard crane. Here's why.

It's a decision that pivots hundreds of millions of dollars of work away from the Pacific Northwest. But the Navy's rationale is that Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is stretched too thin to take on the Enterprise job.

""Leveraging options to perform ex-Enterprise disposal at commercial facilities is advantageous to the Navy and allows (the shipyard) to prioritize the limited public shipyard infrastructure and workforce for active fleet maintenance"" the Navy wrote in the document released Friday.

In recent years the Navy's submarine and aircraft carrier fleets have been pushed by Navy leaders in the face of global conflict from the War on Terror to disputes in the South China Sea over a rising Chinese Navy presence. Add to that shortages of skilled workers have led to delayed maintenance.

The Navy is ""under tremendous pressure to execute their primary mission of maintaining the operational fleet"" officials said.

""This is just a case of capacity"" said Brad Martin a retired Navy captain who now heads the Institute for Supply Chain Security at the RAND Corporation. ""There's no shortage of work at the public shipyards right now.""

Puget Sound is the biggest of the Navy's four public yards with more than 15000 employees. The other shipyards are located in Pearl Harbor Hawaii; Norfolk Virginia; and Kittery Maine.

More:Talk grows of billions for revamp of Puget Sound nation's shipyards

Rep. Derek Kilmer D-Gig Harbor had previously lobbied for the Enterprise work to come to Bremerton. But he said Friday that the Navy's investments in Puget Sound show a commitment here that will remain unchanged by wherever the Enterprise is recycled. Billions of dollars in federal money will optimize the shipyard in coming years including the construction of a more than $1 billion state-of-the-art dry dock capable of working on the newest Virginia-class attack submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers.

""The Navy’s perspective – and it’s a reasonable perspective – is that maintenance of the active fleet is more important to our national security and a better use of the extraordinary talents of workers at PSNS than recycling work for retired vessels"" Kilmer said.

A 2018 Government Accountability Report found the cost to dismantle Enterprise will likely be between $750 million and $1.55 billion.

Completing the job in Puget Sound would also take longer and cost more money Navy officials acknowledged. Bremerton's shipyard would likely have to wait to perform the work until between 2030 and 2040.

Alan Beam a board member of the Bremerton-Olympic Peninsula Council Navy League said he was disappointed but not surprised by the news. Beam agreed that Puget Sound Naval Shipyard has to be focused on active ships. But he'd hoped the work could still occur locally giving an opportunity for apprentices and younger workers to gain experience on former vessels before transitioning to the operational fleet.

""We could train on them before they begin working on the active duty fleet"" said Beam a retired Navy captain who commanded the USS Bremerton fast-attack submarine.

The Enterprise was inactivated in Virginia at Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding division following 51 years and more than a million miles traveled at sea. The ship deployed in response to threats ranging from the Cuban Missile Crisis to Operation Enduring Freedom in the Persian Gulf. It was inactivated in 2012.

Newport News Shipbuilding this year won an $11 million contract to store the vessel until September 2024.

It's a peculiar ship. Nothing like Enterprise had been built before and likely nothing will again. It was outfitted with eight nuclear reactors unlike the modern Nimitz class whose ships each possess two.

Those reactors have been defueled but they still have to be packaged and disposed of. The work could go to Brownsville Texas where International Shipbreaking recently took apart the USS Constellation USS Ranger USS Kitty Hawk and USS Independence. But those flattops were conventionally powered. Shipbreakers in the Hampton Roads Metropolitan Area of Virginia and Mobile Alabama will also be considered.

The Navy's environmental impact statement is only a draft and public comment will continue through October. No final decision on Enterprise has yet been made; doing the work at a private shipbreaker is officially now the Navy's ""preferred alternative.""

The shipyard has for decades served as the Navy's go-to installation to recycle nuclear Navy vessels including submarines and cruisers. More than 130 reactor compartments have been packaged floated out of Puget Sound and shipped up the Columbia River to the Hanford site. There they'll sit in a ditch for the next 1000 years or so.

The Enterprise is among a long line of vessels bearing the storied name; the Navy will soon build another of the same name as a Gerald Ford-class aircraft carrier.

Transported to the Hanford site is a packaged reactor compartment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmNhcmdvbmV3cy5uZXQvYWlybGluZXMvdG9wLTI1LWFpci1jYXJnby1jYXJyaWVycy1mb3ItMjAyMS1yZXZlYWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[AIR] Top 25 air cargo carriers for 2021 revealed,"B777F. Copyright: FedEx

IATA World Air Transport Statistics (WATS) data for 2021 showed the top 25 cargo airlines last year had strong volume growth following a tough first pandemic year (full chart at end of article).

Overall traffic in scheduled cargo tonne km (CTK) terms increased by 18.7% year on year in 2021 a drastic improvement on 2020’s decline of 10.6%.

Demand was also up 6.9% on the pre-Covid year of 2019.

Performance at the top 25 airlines was roughly in line with the overall market as those leading carriers saw cargo volumes increase by 18.8% year on year.

Federal Express (FedEx) retained its position as the top cargo airline in 2021 albeit with a lower growth level than many of the other top-performing airlines.

The US express giant saw its volumes increase by 5.1% year on year to 20.7bn CTK.

However volume growth weakened compared to 2020 when the company recorded a 12.3% year-on-year increase over 2019.

FedEx benefitted from strong demand for e-commerce Covid vaccines PPE and related supplies plus international export and US domestic package volume growth.

Pandemic-related cargo charters and the resumption of passenger operations helped Qatar Airways move into second place in 2021 with a volume increase of 17.2% year on year to 16.1bn CTK.

The carrier also took delivery of three new B777 freighters at the start of last year.

United Parcel Service (UPS) saw growth of 8.1% to 15.5bn CTK last year but the express operator dropped one place to third position.

UPS’s large fleet enabled it to make the most of demand but like FedEx it wasn’t as able to capitalise on demand from freight forwarders and shippers for dedicated operations unlike others in the top 25.

The company added that growth in e-commerce growth slowed as the year progressed as covid restrictions were lifted and access to retail stores became easier.

Emirates benefited from the return of passenger operations to retain fourth place but Cathay Pacific Airways’ capacity suffered due to quarantine requirements for Hong Kong-based pilots and cabin crew.

Meanwhile cargo airline and aircraft lessor Atlas Air picked up both market growth and additional charter demand and All Nippon Airways (ANA) also prospered with demand for e-commerce and electronics serving it well while it added larger aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMDk5NjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electrified ammonia production as a commodity and energy storage medium to connect the food energy and trade ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222009968 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI1ODkwMDQyMjIwMDk5NjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRvLXZhcmlnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happened To Brazilian Carrier Varig?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRvLXZhcmlnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B7F9E5F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRvLXZhcmlnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

It is like the world’s biggest game of sand box Tonka trucks and like in the sand box sometimes things happen. In this case an operator rolled a Caterpillar D11 bulldozer down an embankment leaving it in a weird and tough spot to rescue it from. As you will see the thing was also sitting upside down so just dragging it out with other machines was not really an option. Enter the mighty dragline.

The dragline is the biggest machine in the mining arsenal. The size of a building on tracks and supporting a boom that is hundreds and hundreds of feet long these machines work day and nice pulling a massive bucket along to remove material that is then loaded into trucks for processing. It is nearly impossible to understand the size of these machines until you see one with a quarter million pound bulldozer hanging from it like a Hot Wheels car.

Yes a Caterpillar D11 as configured here comes in at around 220-230000lbs and yes this thing grabbed it and put it down again like a load of bread. The ROPS and the soft nature of its landing spot seems to have spared the dozer from any massive damage and we hope the operator was OK.

Behold the mightiness and size of the dragline. Just look at the photo of the bucker next to the overturned dozer and you know exactly what you are dealing with here. Monstrous!

Check out these photos and remember that the D11 weighs a quarter million pounds!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcXVpcG1lbnR3b3JsZC5jb20vY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWVxdWlwbWVudC9oZWF2eS1lcXVpcG1lbnQvZXhjYXZhdG9ycy9hcnRpY2xlLzE1Mjk1NzM4L2NhdC11bnZlaWxzLXVwZGF0ZWQtMzUwLWV4Y2F2YXRvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cat unveils updated 350 excavator,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcXVpcG1lbnR3b3JsZC5jb20vY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWVxdWlwbWVudC9oZWF2eS1lcXVpcG1lbnQvZXhjYXZhdG9ycy9hcnRpY2xlLzE1Mjk1NzM4L2NhdC11bnZlaWxzLXVwZGF0ZWQtMzUwLWV4Y2F2YXRvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B981A320>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcXVpcG1lbnR3b3JsZC5jb20vY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWVxdWlwbWVudC9oZWF2eS1lcXVpcG1lbnQvZXhjYXZhdG9ycy9hcnRpY2xlLzE1Mjk1NzM4L2NhdC11bnZlaWxzLXVwZGF0ZWQtMzUwLWV4Y2F2YXRvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaGFlZmZlcnNyZXNlYXJjaC5jb20vY29udGVudC9hbmFseXNpcy8yMDIyLzA4LzE4L2NhdGVycGlsbGFyLXN0b2NrLWlzLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1qdXN0LWEtZGl2aWRlbmQtcGxhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar Stock is More Than Just a Dividend Play,"Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) started off the month with a post-earnings bear gap even despite the company's top-line beat. Three weeks later has the technical setup for the blue-chip changed?

Caterpillar stock is up 10% this quarter alone but the round-number $200 level has served as a ceiling this summer. The shares descending 80-day moving average is also keeping the rally in check.

Still CAT provides a fair valuation at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.80 and a price-sales ratio of 1.98. Caterpillar stock also offers a decent dividend yield of 2.43% at a forward dividend of $4.80 having paid a cash dividend every year since 1933. Moreover CAT has paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 28 consecutive years and is recognized as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index making Caterpillar stock a safe option for long-term and dividend investors.

The construction and mining equipment company is expected to complete fiscal 2022 with 12.8% revenue growth and 15.9% earnings growth. CAT is also estimated to continue growing in fiscal 2023 with 5.4% revenue growth and 10.6% earnings growth setting up Caterpillar stock as a solid play for the coming years."

My dad worked on Wall Street for 60 years. When I was 17 he got me a job on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In those days that was very cool.

How so? As a teenager to walk onto the trading floor with 2000 people running around yelling and handling large monetary transactions was exciting. Every morning the trading bell would ring and you were off to the races.

Your proudest moment? Taking the CBOE public in 2010. It took years of litigation because the Chicago Board of Trade had a stranglehold on it for decades. Electronic trading was gaining momentum and the floor members were afraid they would lose their jobs. Winning that battle was the hardest and most satisfying accomplishment of my career.

Your favorite charities? I was on the board of Northwestern Hospital for 25 years including as chairman and I’ve been chairman of Navy Pier for 10 years since it became a nonprofit.

Favorite free time pursuits? My wife and I have a beautiful property near Lake Geneva. Since COVID we have been spending three nights a week there. I like to ride our ATV and snowmobile go fishing and boating and the scenery is great for Zoom meetings.

Any collections? I have roughly 200 photos and prints of financial exchanges from around the world dating back to the Dutch in 1600s including Karachi London and St. Petersburg before communism.

Something you can’t part with? My 1967 Cadillac El Dorado which I bought 50 years ago. I had a guy fixing it up pre-internet buying parts one at a time. Finally I just bought another car and he stripped it for parts. It was cheaper.",,,,,,,,,

NAKAGAWA: We announced a strategic partnership with AWS for the world's first academic medical center to host the Cloud Innovation Center. The thematic focus of that is digital health equity and open innovation. The CIC embodies our vision for how academic medical centers can partner with industry to drive thought leadership and innovation.

Industry has always partnered with academic medical centers but I think some of the overhead and bureaucracy has to do with intellectual property. What if we didn't have to worry about IP and just focused on solving those big hairy problems in healthcare? The CIC is a platform for any organization any health system any patient or clinician to be able to post problems that they see in health equity. From there we work with them to brainstorm and prototype solutions free from IP or budget constraints since those are often the barriers that can hinder innovation and collaboration.

We have so many patients and clinicians who have amazing ideas but they don't know who to go to or how to create technical specifications for an app or prototype. How do we remove those barriers so people can just bring their expertise and ideas and we can handle the rest? That type of model can drive a lot of untapped potential in healthcare to solve big problems.

Ultimately we’re exploring how we can create new models of innovation within healthcare. We see opportunities to break the mold around how to innovate and collaborate more fluidly.

HEALTHTECH: What does human-centered design mean for your organization? How do you define it?

NAKAGAWA: We define human-centered design as the practice of reframing the narrative around the person and experience instead of the technology. We prioritize understanding the problem or experience as deeply as possible. Curiosity is the guiding force; listening is the primary tool. But there’s the definition and there’s the practice and the true test is whether you can truly practice that philosophy. How do we think about innovation as human-first and experience-driven with technology as just an enabler?

In medicine this type of practice is especially difficult because we rely on expertise passed down through generations of training to make sure our patients get the best care possible. But for the practice of innovation we want to take the opposite approach — we want to remove ourselves from our own expertise and challenge our unconscious biases or at least be able to recognize that no matter what we do we bring a certain amount of bias. If we can be more self-aware of our biases we will naturally want to include other people in the equation. Ultimately we try to approach everything with a beginner’s mind which allows us to tackle every problem with extreme curiosity respect and humility.

EXPLORE: The future of healthcare in the public cloud.

HEALTHTECH: How do concepts of DEI fit into this conversation? What are the structures in place to combat implicit biases?

NAKAGAWA: Diversity of thought experience background and opinion are central to our success. But we do need to have better structures in place to ensure that we’re bringing that diversity to every problem we’re tackling. We can’t just completely rely on our individual commitments to combating implicit bias. At UC Davis Health we’re creating those structures and processes by engaging with the community at every stage of the design and innovation process. How do we incorporate people in our communities into the design and innovation processes from day one?

With the CIC for example we are being very intentional about making sure that we’re getting challenges sourced from underserved communities. We see them as key partners in our effort to drive more equitable innovations. We need to make sure they’re involved from the very beginning and at every stage of the innovation process. That’s some of the structure we are putting in place to ensure that we are combating implicit biases and unlocking new ideas.

HEALTHTECH: What successes or failures have you noticed when structures to ensure DEI are applied to a project or when they haven’t been applied?

NAKAGAWA: Unfortunately I can't give you good examples of success stories yet but we’re very cognizant of two key fail points at the design and testing stages.

In the design stage I don't think we invest enough in understanding the problem. When it comes to innovation we jump too quickly to figuring out what the solution is. But how do we create a groundbreaking solution without investing enough in understanding the problem? When we look at reducing health disparities a lot of time is required to unpack the root causes of those disparities. Being able to step back and recognize that this is not going to be a quick exercise — even just saying that out loud to the team at the beginning — is important. If we can study each problem deeply the solutions will organically reveal themselves in the process. In medicine we often need to respond quickly to situations especially in the ICU or emergency department.

CHARLOTTE N.C. — Centene is canceling its Charlotte headquarters plan Charlotte City Council Member Dimple Ajmera confirmed Thursday.

Ajmera said she shares the ""community's disappointment about Centene's decision not to establish an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte"" but says Centene will still do business in Charlotte.

The government health insurance provider announced in 2020 it would build an East Coast campus in Charlotte.The project was expected to create roughly 3200 jobs in the next 10 years.

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper praised the plan as the state's largest single jobs announcement in nearly two decades.

The facility is already under construction -- the company broke ground on the facility in the summer of 2020. Ajmera said Centene is building the planned facility to sell which she hopes will result in private investment.

Macie Kelly/Houston Public Media

Houston drivers will want to pay attention to the radar Thursday afternoon with strong thunderstorms expected to roll into the region.

The National Weather Service is expecting isolated showers all afternoon thanks to a cold front arriving in northern counties around Greater Houston.

Those storms are expected to move towards Houston Metro possibly impacting rush hour traffic and throughout the evening.

""If the timing ends up being where we think it’ll be the roads are probably going to become wet. There could be some strong storms maybe some gusty winds with stronger activity. But the main threat will be just rainfall everywhere"" says Joshua Lichter NOAA Weather Radio.

Some areas will get between 1-2 inches of rain which Lichter says could cause flooding.

The chances of the system producing a tornado or hail is low but the possibility is not being ruled out. Winds could gust in between 30-45 miles an hour.

The downpours are expected to last up until around 9 p.m. with a weak frontal boundary coming in and the sea breeze moving in from the south.

""Pay attention to maybe before you leave work or hit school to pick up children. Check the radar out; you might want to leave a little earlier depending on where the storms are. But we’re expecting them to move in from the north"" Lichter says.

Rainy conditions are expected for the Houston area on Friday and throughout the weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8wOC8xOC90ZXNsYS10c2xhLWNvbmZpcm1zLWxhdW5jaC1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1yZXRhaWwtYnVzaW5lc3MtdGV4YXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla (TSLA) confirms plan to launch electricity retail business in Texas,"Tesla has confirmed its plan to launch a new electricity retail business in Texas through a new job posting for a role overseeing the new business unit.

Last year Tesla created a new business unit called Tesla Energy Ventures and applied with the Public Utility Commission of Texas to sell electricity on the retail market.

The plans haven’t been clear but Tesla has since launched a virtual power plant demonstration with Powerwall owners in Texas and the goal is to demonstrate the value to ERCOT Texas’s electric utility regulating body in order to operate a virtual power plant in the state – as it does in California.

Tesla could be looking to get deeper into the Texas energy market and become a dull electricity retailer which is what the company now confirms through a new job posting found by Electrek. The automaker is looking for a “Product Operations Manager Retail Electricity” based in Austin.

In the description Tesla said that the role will oversee “the launch and growth of a new electricity retailer in the Texas market.”

This Product Operations Manager will be central to the success of Tesla’s emerging Electricity Retail business. This person will support the launch and growth of a new electricity retailer in the Texas market. This person will be responsible for managing retail electricity products administering the customer portfolio coordinating customer support and tracking financial performance.

The company added that it would prefer someone with experience “in residential electricity retail preferably with a retail electricity provider in ERCOT.”

Tesla has been expanding its solar and storage business rapidly in Texas. The automaker is currently building what will likely become the largest rooftop solar installation in the world at Gigafactory Texas and it is also planning a large battery system with a planned output of 250 MW.

The move into electricity retail in Texas appears to be part of Musk’s vision for Tesla Energy to become a distributed global utility. The CEO also said that he believes Tesla’s energy business could outgrow its automotive business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndldnYuY29tL25ld3MvYml0cy1ieXRlcy1kZWxpLWNsb3NpbmctdGhlaXItZG9vcnMtYWZ0ZXItMzYteWVhcnMvYXJ0aWNsZV9kZGQ3NTVlMC0xZjUxLTExZWQtOWMwNy1hZjIwZmUyYTdjZWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bits & Bytes Deli closing their doors after 36 years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndldnYuY29tL25ld3MvYml0cy1ieXRlcy1kZWxpLWNsb3NpbmctdGhlaXItZG9vcnMtYWZ0ZXItMzYteWVhcnMvYXJ0aWNsZV9kZGQ3NTVlMC0xZjUxLTExZWQtOWMwNy1hZjIwZmUyYTdjZWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BA87F3D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndldnYuY29tL25ld3MvYml0cy1ieXRlcy1kZWxpLWNsb3NpbmctdGhlaXItZG9vcnMtYWZ0ZXItMzYteWVhcnMvYXJ0aWNsZV9kZGQ3NTVlMC0xZjUxLTExZWQtOWMwNy1hZjIwZmUyYTdjZWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

C.H. Robinson Project Cargo Network (PCN) Members from Canada recently completed a series of shipments from a plant closure in New York to locations across the globe. Most of the equipment had been sold off but five machine lines were being sent to other plants including Colombia Peru and Morocco.

The customer had never taken on such a large project before so they looked to C.H. Robinson’s logistics experts to work as an extension of their team. To start a C.H. Robinson project logistics expert visited the plant to survey the equipment and determine the scope of the project.

The team had a short timeline to move the equipment since the building was going to be sold in four weeks. To prepare C.H. Robinson’s project logistics team - including their solution design engineers - and the customer worked to develop an all-inclusive solution for the project including pickup storage crating and container service to the destination ports.

Once the day arrived for tear-down C.H. Robinson worked with their contract carriers to arrange pick up storage and crating for all the equipment. Due to equipment shortages the team originally planned on moving the over-length cargo via RO/RO but after working with the container lines they were able to secure a 45’ container which allowed the equipment to move together.

In total 262 pieces of equipment measuring 1377 cubic meters and weighing 310 metric tons were transported. The project utilized C.H. Robinson’s global suite of services including trucking warehousing crating container loading blocking bracing drayage ocean export and insurance.

Over the course of 5 sailings they helped transport one 20-foot and four 40-foot out of gauge flatracks one 20-foot standard container thirty-three 40-foot-high cube containers and one 45-foot-high cube container.

""Overall C.H. Robinson’s careful planning proactive communication throughout the life of the project and information advantage drove better outcomes for their customer.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
CRL,Charles River Laboratories,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb3Byb2Nlc3NpbnRsLmNvbS9zcG9uc29yZWQtY29udGVudC9hLWJpb3RlY2gtcmV2b2x1dGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,: Single-Use Systems Have Changed CDMO Focus,"To celebrate the 20th anniversary of BioProcess International Tony Hitchcock (technical director at Charles River Laboratories) participated in a supplier survey on important bioprocess innovations technologies and advancements over the past two decades. He has over 38 years of experience in the biotechnology industry specifically in production of critical starting materials and complex biologics for clinical trials.

What is the most important bioprocessing innovation in the past 20 years? The emergence and adoption of single-use production systems has been important both for contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and the sector overall. Although cross-contamination risk is a factor in the manufacturing of all biopharmaceutical products that risk is especially significant for

multiproduct facilities that manufacture materials for clinical trials and have limited data available that relate to product safety and dose level as well as limited assay validation to demonstrate product clearance

facilities processing gene-based medicines (because such products have the potential for long-term expression of therapeutic genes within patients).

Establishing reliable cleaning procedures for removing plasmid DNA (pDNA) and viral vectors is difficult because of the sensitivity of assays based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine residual product levels. The bioprocess industry also lacks established acceptable levels of product carry-over by regulators or quality groups to ensure patient safety.

About 20 years ago biomanufacturers producing clinical-trial materials often resorted to regarding stainless-steel equipment as “single use” when product changeover was required. Such was the case for equipment for downstream processing where product concentrations can be high and contamination removal can be difficult (e.g. in tangential-flow filtration (TFF) and chromatography flow paths). That approach was unsustainable and expensive because it sometimes required that all product-contacting parts be replaced (e.g. flow paths vessels and elastomers).

When single-use equipment became available manufacturers such as Cobra Biologics (now integrated into Charles River) adopted those components initially with bioprocessing bags and membrane systems and then with complex systems such as single-use fermentors and TFF systems. The adoption of single-use systems had profound effects on the operation of CDMO businesses because it reduced or eliminated the burden of cleaning and testing equipment and eliminated the risk of cross-contamination.

The implementation of single-use systems also changed approaches to process design and manufacturing scale. Those changes enabled process development for novel therapies including advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs). Traditionally such development required engagement with process engineers as well as significant capital investment (e.g. in equipment cleaning systems) and in sterilization infrastructure. The use of single-use systems enabled process development and operations personnel to design and configure processes without those requirements. Timelines and costs for development also were reduced enabling new processes or the updating of existing processes.

Thus small CDMOs have become engaged in the production of pDNA and viral vectors for clinical trials with low levels of capital investment in facilities and equipment supporting the establishment of multiproduct facilities to manufacture both clinical-study and commercial materials. Such advancements are important to facilities that manufacture clinical-trial materials because often only one or two batches are required. The use of single-use technologies also means that suppliers processing commercial materials of drug substances and/or drug products can perform rapid turnarounds between products. In turn facility designs site layouts and build approaches changed. Simple facilities (in terms of capital equipment) were constructed but they had significantly complex logistical requirements because of the number of consumables components required (>1000 per batch).

CDMO capabilities have expanded in the bioprocessing space. Before single-use adoption most CDMOs were established manufacturing facilities seeking to use unused capacity. Single-use platforms have enabled capacities to be established rapidly in purpose-built facilities for both antibodies and ATMPs. Single-use technologies have supported manufacturing platforms for new clinical entities (e.g. for pDNA viral vectors cell therapies and exosomes). Although some large-scale commercial products will continue to be made in sites supported by stainless-steel equipment single-use systems also will be a critical part of producing existing and future clinical entities.

What has been the regulatory development that has shaped the growth of your company? Introduction of the European Clinical Trials Directive (2001) has had a profound impact for European manufacturers. It has been a double-edged sword in placing significant costs onto manufacturers including the need to be regularly inspected and licensed by member states national regulators. For small and start-up companies or academic centers establishing manufacturing capabilities it is especially burdensome because there has been an increase in regulatory expectation around facility design and quality management systems. For product developers however it has created a level platform for the quality systems applied to the production of clinical trial materials and has meant that product manufactured under these regulations can be used for global clinical studies which is important for developers wanting to access multiple clinical trials centers and global expertise.

What has been the most important development in bioprocess business strategy? An increasing number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the sector has influenced the relationships between suppliers and producers significantly. Suppliers have grown through acquisitions of stand-alone single-use vendors and through investments based on the adoption of single-use systems for commercial and clinical production. Companies have become not only equipment or consumable suppliers but also whole-process “solution providers” for antibodies vaccines and ATMPs. In turn the bioprocess industry has increased its dependency on a few key suppliers and some biomanufacturers are relying on a single supplier for much of their production equipment and consumables. That dependency has lead to both biomanufacturers and CDMOs facing delays caused by supply-chain issues.

The CDMO sector has experienced M&A activity to expand core capabilities for both established and new therapies. Although many CDMOs have emerged in the cell and gene therapy space the manufacture of such products is complex. Part of that is a result of maintaining supply chains for critical starting materials (e.g. pDNA and viral vectors) and raw materials (particularly for cell therapies) as well as the need for complex testing and characterization of those products. Thus it is not surprising that the bioprocess industry has experienced significant M&A in that area with many companies developing “end-to-end” solutions.

For example Charles River has integrated cell and gene therapy acquisitions Cognate BioServices Cobra Biologics Vigene Biosciences Hemacare Cellero Distributed Bio and Retrogenix to expand its impact along the drug development life cycle beyond existing industry-leading drug discovery safety/toxicology assessment and analytical development/testing portfolios. The company offers human cellular material pDNA and viral vector supply through cell modification selection release supply and broad access to patients.

Which of your company’s products or services have been most successful in the past 20 years? From my perspective the key services that Charles River offers have been in the production of pDNA and gene therapy vectors. Early on pDNA was used almost solely as a direct therapy and was deemed to be safer than viral-based gene delivery through human adenoviral vectors. Significant effort was invested into the development of DNA vaccines for HIV but those vaccines were unsuccessful and interest in large-scale plasmid production fell during the mid-late 2000s. The market remained that way until around 2015 when an increasing number of clinical studies became successful with therapies based on adenoassociated virus (AAV) and lentivirus (LV). In turn funding for developers increased enabling them to bring those therapies to clinical trials and to the market. Thus the pDNA industry is expanding rapidly along with an upturn in the numbers of players in what is forecast to be a key market in the next 10 years.

Gene therapies have been a part of the biomanufacturing industry over the past 30 years. These products had an initial surge of interest during the 1990s followed by technical and clinical setbacks and a reemergence over the past 10 years based on the clinical successes of AAV- and retro/LV-based therapies through transient production. Production of vectors through transient production routes requires manufacturing three or four plasmids for each viral vector. That requires biomanufacturers to commit to significant time and cost demands. To alleviate that regulators recognized that there was not an absolute requirement for plasmid to be produced to GMP and that it should be produced to a “high quality.” Our team has developed phase-appropriate manufacturing strategies and now manufactures GMP/high-quality and non-GMP research-grade pDNA.

The bioprocess industry needs highly robust production platforms that can produce multiple plasmids without extensive development with identical production equipment. The outcome will be standardized manufacturing platforms that can perform at different scales and under different quality systems to meet customer requirements for early to late-phase trials and commercial supplies. The Charles River Laboratories team continues to innovate adapt and expand to serve rapidly growing market spaces. For example we are opening the Alderley Park site to expand our pDNA capabilities tripling HQ plasmid production and launching off-the-shelf plasmids.

The gene therapy market is likely to continue to have a high level of diversification in terms of use and routes of generation. I expect that production scales will need to increase to support commercial AAV vector production which might require multihundred-gram amounts of key products. We also are seeing the emergence of personalized therapies and the production of plasmid or mRNA using synthetic approaches. Those technologies will create substantial near-term difficulties for manufacturing regulatory and quality groups to overcome but they also will create significant opportunities for drug developers and equipment manufacturers in the future to advance patient treatment options for severe diseases and conditions.

Albany N.Y. –

This afternoon PETA supporters wearing horse masks descended on the Albany New York set of HBO’s The Gilded Age after learning from a whistleblower that distressed horses were reportedly not being given adequate water or rest while being forced to pull carriages for long hours in scorching heat for the show. One horse even reportedly broke away from a wrangler and trampled an actor. More photos are available here.

The protest came after a horse collapsed and died on The Gilded Age’s Long Island set while filming a carriage scene in June and amid renewed calls to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City after a horse recently collapsed on a busy street.

“Whether it’s on a busy New York City street or a crowded television production set horses suffer when they’re forced to pull buggies in all weather extremes” says PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange. “PETA is calling on HBO to get with the program and ban the use of vulnerable horses in its productions.”

PETA has filed a request with the Albany Police Department for an investigation to pursue any appropriate cruelty-to-animals charges.

PETA—whose motto reads in part that “animals are not ours to use for entertainment”—opposes speciesism a human-supremacist worldview. For more information please visit PETA.org or follow the group on Twitter Facebook or Instagram.",,,,,,,,,

Here's what you need to know.

Charles Schwab recently launched a new exchange-traded fund designed for retail investors who want indirect exposure to the crypto market without the direct risk of holding cryptocurrencies. The new Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (STCE 1.02%) will invest in companies that may benefit from the development or utilization of cryptocurrencies such as cryptocurrency mining companies and cryptocurrency exchanges. But it will not take a position in any cryptos directly.

For investors who might be wary of buying crypto now this could be a more diversified way to get exposure to crypto during a volatile and uncertain market. The ETF tracks the Schwab Crypto Thematic Index which is comprised of companies active in the crypto and digital asset space. However just keep in mind that you won't get the same upside potential that you would get from investing in cryptocurrencies directly.

What's in the Schwab crypto ETF?

Like any standard ETF the Charles Schwab crypto ETF blends together a large number of investments in a wide range of companies all in the name of hedging away risk while also giving investors exposure to companies whose business model is based to a large degree on crypto. As a result there are only a handful of companies currently in the ETF blend in which Charles Schwab has taken a larger than 5% allocation.

In addition there are about 30 other companies active in the crypto and digital asset space with no allocation in any of them exceeding 5%. These include financial services firms and cryptocurrency mining stocks. But there are also some companies you might not expect in sectors such as e-commerce.

Risk management

It is easy to see how investing in this ETF could be one way to reduce your overall risk as a crypto investor. You might love the idea that MicroStrategy Inc. has a huge Bitcoin position on its balance sheet or that its chairman Michael Saylor is known for his extremely aggressive stance on Bitcoin. But since MicroStrategy comprises only 7.91% of the total crypto blend in the ETF you won't have to worry about the price of Bitcoin taking a steep dive and wiping out your investment.

Or if you're having a hard time making sense of which crypto mining stock is the best investment right now you no longer have to worry about making that call. There are a handful of different mining stocks in the current ETF composition including Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and Riot Blockchain Inc. both of which rank among the top-five holdings.

Upside potential

However it is important to note is that you simply will not have access to the upside potential of a direct investment in cryptocurrency via this new ETF. For example if the price of Bitcoin spikes up by 10% within a relatively short time period it does not imply that the price of the ETF will also spike up 10% in the same time period.

This inability to track the Bitcoin market precisely was one of the concerns of the first official Bitcoin ETF the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. When it first launched in October 2021 it attracted quite a bit of buzz because retail investors finally had a way to invest in crypto without well investing in crypto. Instead of buying Bitcoin directly you bought shares in the Bitcoin ETF which used derivatives contracts to create what can best be called ""synthetic"" Bitcoin.

A fully diversified crypto portfolio?

Looking through the holdings of the Schwab crypto ETF it appears that the only holdings that will get you anything close to heavy exposure to Bitcoin are the mining stocks. Moreover if you are looking for ways to get exposure to other cryptos beyond Bitcoin you would most likely need to open up an account at a cryptocurrency exchange in order to purchase them directly.

It will be interesting to see what happens next in the crypto ETF space. There are now a growing number of crypto ETF options for investors who don't want to get involved directly in holding cryptos. Each of them has a slightly different risk-reward profile. Once the regulatory environment becomes more favorable for crypto one can imagine that future crypto ETFs will become even more creative in how they track overall market performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmQtaW5ub3ZhdG9ycy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8taG9ub3Itd29tZW4taW4tbWFya2V0aW5nLWtlZXAtYXNraW5nLXRoZS1oYXJkLXF1ZXN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Honor Women in Marketing?

ASHEVILLE N.C. — Spectrum today announced it has been awarded a North Carolina Growing Rural Economies with Access to Technology (GREAT) Program grant of $4 million to bring gigabit high-speed internet access to approximately 3500 homes and small businesses in Polk County. Combined with the state grant of $4 million and a contribution from the County of $250000 the total project investment including $7.8 million from Spectrum is $12 million.

The GREAT grant is one of nine already awarded to Spectrum to expand fiber-optic broadband infrastructure to areas of the state that currently lack access to high-speed connections. The company is awaiting review of 51 additional GREAT proposals that if awarded would bring broadband to an additional 71000 homes and small businesses in 51 counties across North Carolina which has the second-largest rural population of any state.

“All North Carolina communities families and businesses need access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet” said Gov. Roy Cooper. “This round of grants means more North Carolinians will be able to take advantage of opportunities to learn work access health care and connect to the world.”

“I’ve served Polk County residents in many capacities and understand how important broadband access is for our families and small businesses” said state Rep. Jake Johnson. “I’m thrilled the state legislature allocated funding for Polk County to work with Charter to bring high-speed internet to unserved parts of the county.”

Spectrum is already North Carolina’s largest broadband provider serving 2.8 million customers and employing nearly 11000 residents in the state.

“Gov. Cooper his administration and the North Carolina Legislature have shown tremendous leadership in embracing public-private partnerships as a vital strategy for connecting unserved communities” said Brian Gregory Vice President of Government Affairs at Charter. “We applaud Polk County officials for contributing to this project to make a meaningful difference for residents.”

“We also commend the legislature and Cooper administration for their support of a $100 million utility pole replacement fund as part of the state’s broadband strategy which is paying off with significant interest and investment. In all Spectrum proposed 60 broadband projects across 60 counties and $190 million in investment thanks to the positive regulatory climate and investment in pole infrastructure” added Gregory.

“All Polk County residents deserve access to high-speed internet and the GREAT grants along with broadband providers like Charter are making that a reality” said Polk County Board Chairman Melton.

GREAT Program grants further expand Spectrum’s rural construction initiative the centerpiece of which is the company’s approximately $5 billion investment in unserved rural communities which includes more than $1 billion won in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) auction. The company’s RDOF expansion will provide broadband access to approximately 1 million customer locations as estimated by the FCC across 24 states — including more than 125000 locations in North Carolina — in the coming years. Combined Spectrum’s GREAT Program grant and RDOF buildouts in Polk County will bring broadband access to more than 4800 homes and small businesses.

Amid the slowdown of new content on traditional television and reduced sports programming streaming claimed the largest share of U.S. TV viewing in July—a first after four consecutive months of hitting new viewership highs. Streaming viewership in a given month has exceeded broadcast viewing before but this is the first time it has also surpassed cable viewing.

In addition to claiming the largest viewership share during the month audiences watched an average of 190.9 billion minutes of streamed content per week—easily surpassing the 169.9 billion minutes that audiences watched during the pandemic lockdown period back in April 2020. Excluding the week of Dec. 27 2021 the five weeks of July 2022 represent the highest-volume streaming weeks on record according to Nielsen measurement.

Aside from the shifting viewership shares total TV usage during the month was virtually identical to that of June as well as July 2021. The trends continue to highlight that with other variables held constant Americans are expanding their streaming consumption and the platforms that they use.

Overall streaming usage grew 3.2% from June. On a year over year basis streaming volume increased 22.6% growing its share of usage by 6.5 points. In July Prime Video Hulu Netflix and YouTube reached new heights again. Netflix gained 8% share boosted by the nearly 18 billion minutes of Stranger Things that viewers watched complemented by the nearly 11 billion minutes of combined viewing of Virgin River and The Umbrella Academy. Movies The Gray Man and The Sea Beast contributed over 5 billion minutes. Hulu’s record share was helped by the new season of Only Murders in the Building and The Bear which combined for 3 billion minutes viewed. Amazon’s Prime Video’s 3.0 share was driven by the new series The Terminal List and new episodes of The Boys which netted over 8 billion viewing minutes.

And with so much content entering the streaming space both from the pure players and traditional media companies it’s worth highlighting the impact of content from digital MVPDs (e.g. Hulu Live YouTube TV) and traditional cable apps (Comcast Charter/Spectrum). This content now represents 11.2% of streaming and 3.9% of total TV usage.

Broadcast at 21.6% share of television was down 3.7% on volume compared with last month representing a 0.8 share point dip. On a year-over-year basis the shift in viewing behavior is more evident as broadcast viewing dropped 9.8% for a loss of 2.3 share points. Given the end of the NHL and NBA playoffs in June the 41% drop in sports viewing was a factor in the drop. From last year when there was some Olympics content in addition to NHL and NBA the drop was 43%.

From June 2022 cable usage dropped 2% resulting in a loss of 0.7 share points. From last July cable usage was down 8.9% and 3.3 share points. Engagement with cable genres was fairly flat in July with sports posting the biggest decline—dropping 15.4% for the month and 34% from a year ago.

The Master Framework Program for Financial Institutions will allow ADB to increase its lending to both commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions in the region through the use of credit insurance.

ADB has signed an initial 3-year partnership with Tokio Marine Group (Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd and Tokio Marine HCC) AXA XL Chubb Liberty Specialty Markets and Allianz Trade.

The highly rated insurers participating in the program will cover the risk of nonpayment on a portion of ADB’s loans to financial institutions. This will allow ADB to transfer credit risk from its portfolio to insurers’ balance sheets freeing up ADB’s capital managing its exposures and increasing its lending capacity.

“ADB has been a pioneer among multilateral development banks in partnering with private insurance companies to expand lending operations through the use of credit insurance” said Head of ADB’s Guarantees and Syndications Unit Bart Raemaekers. “The relationships we’ve built with insurers have allowed us to mobilize this additional source of private capital as cofinancing to help meet our client’s needs.”

“Tokio Marine Group has always worked closely with multilateral development institutions like ADB with whom we share common goals and values as Tokio Marine continues to pursue its vision To Be a Good Company” said Tokio Marine HCC – Credit Group President Jerome Swinscoe. “Our partnership with ADB has grown through the years. This landmark program has come at an opportune time when we can all contribute to the economic recovery that Asia needs. We are honored to be a part of this endeavor.”

The program streamlines the underwriting and approval process for risk transfers and will allow ADB to more efficiently mobilize cofinancing capacity. ADB’s loans to the financial sector have included support for operational priorities such as micro small and medium-sized enterprises gender equality and efforts to address climate change.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous inclusive resilient and sustainable Asia and the Pacific while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966 it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWF0dC1jaGFuZGxlci1yZWZsZWN0cy1vbi1ncmFjZS1oZS1yZWNlaXZlZC1hZnRlci1jb250cm92ZXJzeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy,"Home News Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy

Matt Chandler has opened up about what he learned about grace and accountability after being restored to the pulpit following a tumultuous period in 2022 in which he took a leave of absence from teaching and preaching at The Village Church in Flower Mound Texas.

In August 2022 Chandler announced to The Village Church congregation which he has led since 2002 that he had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman and would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from preaching and teaching.

Though the relationship was not sexual or romantic Chandler said church elders deemed the messages exchanged over Instagram ""unguarded and unwise"" and ""revealed something unhealthy in me.""

""We cannot be a church where anyone is above the scriptures and above the high heavenly call into Christ Jesus"" Chandler said adding he agreed with the elder's assessment. ""The Word of God holds me to a certain standard. And I fell short.""

He was restored to the pulpit a little over three months later following a ""profound time of healing.""

In an interview with The Christian Post the 49-year-old husband and father-of-three reflected on that time and said that when he ""stumbled"" he was instantly met with grace and accountability from those around him.

""The thing about [2022] in particular was that the kind of culture we had tried to build here — one of accountability and a higher standard for a person in public ministry — held strong"" Chandler explained. ""When I stumbled I was met with both grace and accountability.""

For Chandler — who has made messages on God's grace a hallmark of his ministry — the experience solidified the notion that grace is not an abstract concept but a tangible force that exists alongside the weight of accountability.

He credited his church's transparent handling of the controversy with allowing his congregation to witness the reality of both concepts in action; they saw firsthand he said that while grace offers forgiveness there is often a price for missteps.

In the aftermath Chandler observed that the church community became more willing to confess their struggles taking proactive steps to address what he described as ""little lions"" or small issues that could grow into significant problems if left unchecked.

""What that produced in our congregation is another visible picture that that grace is real and that there is still at times a payment for stumbling that is costly in other areas"" he said.

""We have seen since people are more apt to confess more quickly … we have seen a tremendous amount of trust in the processes we have in place to deal with those kinds of things in the lives of people. And so that's been the fruit of that.""

Reflecting on the unique pressures of pastoral ministry Chandler who also serves as executive director of the church-planting network Acts 29 spoke candidly about the loneliness and mental health challenges often faced by spiritual leaders.

Chandler previously served as president of Acts 29 replacing Mark Driscoll who was later disqualified from leadership due to ""ungodly and disqualifying behavior.""

""I think I'm an outlier on this but I've never bought into that a pastor can't be close friends with the guys that he does ministry with"" he said.

Though acknowledging that stories of betrayal and sabotage from within the Church aren't uncommon Chandler said that throughout his ministry he's chosen to cultivate meaningful relationships with those around him.

""I've been involved at the highest level with church planning stuff the number of stories of men being betrayed and sabotaged by other people in the church or other staff members in the church is a very real thing. I'm just not built personality wise to want to do this by myself.""

At The Village Church — a Southern Baptist congregation — Chandler is one of three lead pastors. While his influence might be more visible due to his pulpit presence he emphasized that he has no greater vote in decision-making.

""I have done life deeply with a group of five guys that are on staff with me"" he said. ""Two of those relationships are over 15 years going now and the other ones are right at a decade. I have chosen to not give in to the 'I'm going to carry this thing by myself.' I'm going to invite guys into my life.""

For Chandler this network of trust has been critical particularly when it comes to the ups and downs of the ministry.

""I would encourage guys as best they can to create a strong circle of trust where they don't have to be the hero but can be human. And I say that because they are human"" he advised.

The pastor recently released his first book since returning to the pulpit The Overcomers highlighting how Revelation can help Christians find their ""identity and purpose in God's plan."" He cautioned against creating a culture where pastors are seen as infallible.

""If you create a world where you're the Messiah where you have all the answers you're making an already difficult situation impossible"" he stressed. ""I would encourage any pastor … to begin to create slowly but surely a circle of trust for him that's deeply honest and vulnerable for the good of his own soul.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL3N5ZG5leS1jaHVyY2gtc3RhYmJpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdnMteC1lbG9uLW11c2stZS1zYWZldHktb3JkZXItaW52YWxpZNIBjAFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL3N5ZG5leS1jaHVyY2gtc3RhYmJpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdnMteC1lbG9uLW11c2stZS1zYWZldHktb3JkZXItaW52YWxpZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Order from eSafety to hide Sydney church stabbing video was invalid X tells court,"Elon Musk’s X Corp has argued notices ordering the companyto remove tweets showing video of a stabbing attack at a Sydney church were invalid and told a court it was not reasonable for Australia’s eSafety commissioner to expect the 65 posts to be taken down globally.

Last month X was ordered to hide the posts of the stabbing attack on bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel while he was giving a livestreamed service at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church in the suburb of Wakeley.

Esafety sought a federal court injunction after X only made the tweets unavailable to Australian users and vowed to challenge the notice.

The barrister representing X Bret Walker SC told the court on Friday that X did not believe the notice was valid and was “manifestly inadequate” in lacking detail in the description of the consideration made by the eSafety officer who decided to order the removal of the material and deemed it to be “class 1” under Australian classification law.

Walker argued the determination referred to a depiction of “crime cruelty or violence” which is not something he said would rise to the level that would be refused classification by the classification board in Australia. He said the depiction of such an act of violence with a camera close to see how it is being done does not meet that bar.

The barrister for the eSafety commissioner Tim Begbie KC told the court the decision document captured key factors the decision-maker considered. Begbie said eSafety had 28 days to put on a full statement of the reasons for the decision through the separate review process X launched in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Begbie argued the case at hand was focused on the enforcement of the Online Safety Act and protecting Australians from harm not freedom of speech.

He told the court X wasn’t opposed to globally removing content but says the company has viewed it as unreasonable to globally remove the posts because the Australian government wants it to.

He also said the parliament would have been aware of the global nature of the internet when it passed the Online Safety Act.

Walker said X had taken all reasonable steps to prevent Australians accessing the tweets though it had still been accessible via virtual private network connections for the small subset of people who choose that method of access.

He said it was a “really remarkable proposition” for a country to argue the only way to control what’s available to end users in Australia is “to deny it to everybody on Earth”.

An order to hide the tweets was due to expire at 5pm on Friday but has been extended until Monday pending the court’s decision on the interlocutory order – expected at 10am.

Walker argued before the court that the terms of the order were not compatible with how X’s systems work and there would likely need t be a revision of any order to make the tweets unavailable if the injunction continues prior to a final hearing.

The US-based digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation sought to intervene in the case however eSafety objected arguing that EFF’s position – focused on the potential curtailing of free speech globally under eSafety removal notices – was one “for the ballot box” not the case before the court. Justice Kennett has yet to rule on whether to allow the intervention.

No date has yet been set for the final hearing with another case management hearing scheduled for Wednesday next week. The week of 10 June was potentially floated as one date with the case likely to take two hearing days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advice | Carolyn Hax: In-laws stalk the live stream to check couple's attendance at church,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B9125BA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvY2h1cmNoLWVtcGxveWVlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbHMtb3Zlci0zMzAwMDAtZnJvbS1wcmVzYnl0ZXJpYW4tY2h1cmNoLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church employee allegedly steals over $330000 from Presbyterian church organization,"IDAHO FALLS — A 31-year-old church employee was arrested after she allegedly stole over $330000 from a local Presbyterian organization.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty."

Aug. 18 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cigna Foundation today announced more than $3 million in grants to local nonprofits to help address childhood hunger and mental health concerns as schools return to session. Innovative programs spanning communities in 16 states will receive critical financial support enabling them to positively impact thousands of children across the country.

""Schools and teachers play a critical role in helping their students navigate immense challenges – both inside and outside the classroom. We believe we also have a role to play and are deepening our partnerships with leading local nonprofits that are essential to healthier happier children families and communities"" said Susan Stith president Cigna Foundation.

Grant recipients are addressing some of the toughest challenges facing school-aged children and their families including the rise in mental health issues and food insecurity – both of which worsened due to the pandemic. Research from Economist Impact commissioned by Cigna Corporation found that approximately 80% of working parents surveyed reported some form of impact on the mental health of their teenage children as a result of the pandemic including new or increased levels of anxiety depression behavioral issues and problems with social interactions.

More than 12 million children in the United States are food insecure and do not have consistent access to healthy food. According to Feeding America the pandemic exacerbated food insecurity particularly for families with children and communities of color.

Some of the programs that the Cigna Foundation is partnering with this year are:

Weekend Feeding Backpack Program – Using smartphone technology to help reduce stigma and food waste this program through the Brashear Association allows families at Pittsburgh Arlington and Pittsburgh Grandview schools to select culturally diverse food options as well as receive text messages with healthy meal recipes and nutrition tips.

Outdoor G.I.R.L.S. – Operated through Women's Wilderness Institute in Boulder Colorado this program leverages the transformative power of the outdoors and physical activity in conjunction with trauma-informed practices and clinical support to improve mental health outcomes for adolescent girls who identify as immigrants and refugees. Outdoor G.I.R.L.S. (Girl Immigrant and Refugee Leadership Series) looks to address the social cultural geographical and economic barriers to participation in outdoor and physical activities that immigrant and refugee girls face.

Kid's Cafe – A healthy school pantry located at Northaven Elementary School in Memphis Tennessee and operated by the Mid-South Food Bank provides students in need and their families with a monthly box of nutritious food that is easily accessible providing the equivalent of 42 meals per month. The cafe also provides hot meals to take home every other Friday. Additional programs include Family Night where families will have access to fresh produce and other items such as laundry detergent tissues and paper towels as well as Food for Kids Backpack Program that includes food for the weekend and extended school breaks.

Amped Ecosystem – The Humanities Amped Ecosystem at Broadmoor High School in Baton Rouge Louisiana links social emotional learning with opportunities for youth to use their voices through healing-centered and culturally responsive practices including restorative practices mind-body medicine arts integration project-based learning and peer-led engagement. Before and after school programs such as arts and civics engagement and peer-to-peer activities are also part of this initiative.

All grants are made available through Cigna Foundation's Healthier Kids For Our Future® program a five-year $25 million global initiative focused on improving the health and well-being of children. Since its inception in 2019 the program has awarded more than $18 million in grants.

August 19 2022 - Updated 9/20/22: A previous version of this article included Blue Cross Blue Shield companies as Elevance Health plans. However these companies are not Elevance Health companies. This has been corrected by moving that section to the bottom of the article.

Major payers Elevance Health (formerly Anthem) Aetna and Cigna have taken steps to address social determinants of health demonstrating the broad range of strategies payers have employed and partnerships payers have engaged in order to reduce social determinants of health barriers.

These three payers have the second third and fourth highest market shares in the US health insurance marketplace. In 2020 Elevance held 12 percent of the market share Aetna followed with 11 percent and Cigna rose to 10 percent.

Collectively the payers have used their position to launch initiatives that aim to address social determinants of health factors such as housing and food insecurity poverty care disparities and environmental safety.

Their efforts only represent a sliver of payer activity on this issue but demonstrate the range of social determinants of health strategies being tested in the healthcare industry.

Elevance Health

Elevance Health’s health plans which include Anthem health plans have taken a variety of actions to address a host of social determinants of health barriers.

Several Elevance Health plans have launched strategies to address food insecurity.

Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Georgia partnered with a community-based organization in the Atlanta metro area to establish a facility that would serve the area’s food needs. The facility will be outfitted with a food pantry restaurant and community garden. Products will be sold with the Anthem brand.

Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Missouri partnered with a community-based organization to bring meals to homebound seniors while also providing social interaction.

Aetna

Aetna CVS Health health plans addressed a variety of issues including food insecurity access to mental healthcare housing and employment.

Aetna Better Health of Louisiana put $50000 toward reducing food insecurity in underserved areas. The health plan helped fund the efforts of a local nonprofit that teaches communities about sustainable agricultural practices for urban farming.

In order to improve access to mental healthcare services Aetna Better Health of Kansas donated $125000 toward community health organizations that offer mental health and social care services.

A social determinant of health factor that Aetna plans commonly address is housing. CVS Health has partnered with Fresno Pedcor Investments R4 Capital WNC & Associates Raymond James Tax Credits Funds and other companies to establish affordable housing units. The payer has funded housing developments in Florida Louisiana Tennessee Washington DC and elsewhere.

Employment falls under economic stability one of the five domains of social determinants of health.

CVS Health opened a Workforce Innovation and Talent Center in Pittsburg Pennsylvania in order to continue fostering relationships with community leaders and offer employment training for individuals pursuing pharmacy technician customer service call center and retail associate work. The center includes a simulated retail store and a fully functioning restaurant.

Cigna

Cigna’s social determinants of health work is wide-ranging like its competitors.

The payer sought to address environmental safety during summer heat waves by funding members’ transportation to air-conditioned locations. These destinations could be clinical sites such as doctor offices and pharmacies or public areas like libraries and senior centers.

Cigna also sought to address food insecurity through the Cigna Foundation. The Cigna Foundation donated $2.2 million toward 16 schools that have large populations of low-income students. The funding will be used in part to stock school food pantries and allow schools to offer weekend food kits.

In addition to providing help with food security the 16 schools can use the Cigna Foundation funding to facilitate mental healthcare for students. For example the funds will go toward training teachers on how to introduce mindfulness practices in their classes along with inclusion and social-emotional learning.

The Cigna Foundation also accepted applications for the Education and Workforce Development grant program which aimed to offer opportunities to students across the academic range—from pre-kindergarten to post-secondary—who might face social determinants of health barriers.

Other major health plans—such as Blue Shield of California and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois—donated to organizations that were already on the ground locally addressing food insecurity.

Companies also took steps to address health equity. For example Blue Shield of California invested $150000 into the community of San Joaquin Valley to support health equity initiatives. The initiatives met needs such as hands-on job training and housing services.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan donated toward permanent housing projects to address racial and economic disparities. The housing projects incorporate intensive case management and health and welfare services.

Health plans sought to address care disparities in maternal healthcare an area of healthcare that is deeply affected by social determinants of health barriers that often result in health inequities.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois offered $350000 in grants to six community-based organizations that serve mothers in Chicago’s south- and west-side neighborhoods to improve patient outcomes.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Blue Plus sought to improve information about how food insecurity impacts mothers and infants. The health plan partnered with a food bank and a market platform to research how access to seven months of nutrition benefits and services affected the health of Black and Indigenous pregnant individuals.

Health plans also sought to address poverty by alleviating financial social determinants of health barriers to healthcare.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois invested $20000 in a community network of churches businesses and volunteers that fights poverty. The payer is working with the network to connect impoverished members and their communities with resources.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana put $50000 toward a Healthy Kids Healthy Families grant that sought to support children who face intergenerational poverty. The investment goes into nonprofits that create sustainable opportunities for connecting children and their families with nutrition physical activity suicide prevention disease prevention and management and substance abuse prevention.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzE4L2Nvbm5lY3RpY3V0LWluc3VyYW5jZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXByZXNzZWQtdG8tcmVqZWN0LWRvdWJsZS1kaWdpdC1yYXRlLWluY3JlYXNlcy15b3UtY2FudC1kb3duc2l6ZS15b3VyLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Connecticut insurance department pressed to reject double-digit rate increases 'you can't downsize your health care',"Mike Smith counts himself as lucky. When at 21 he discovered a golf ball-sized tumor on his neck he had health coverage and a support system to back him up.

“I was lucky because it was only stage 2A when I was diagnosed” said Smith now 35. “I was lucky that my mom worked a job that provided good quality health insurance. Otherwise I’d still be crawling out of the nearly million dollars in medical care needed to keep me alive. But we shouldn’t leave the health and the financial fate of our family friends and neighbors to luck.”

Smith asked representatives of the state’s insurance department to reject the 20.4% average increase that insurance companies are seeking for 2023 individual health plans in Connecticut.

“Health insurance prices have gone up. But unlike a pickup truck or an SUV you can’t downsize your health care and save on gas” he said. “When costs for health insurance get too expensive you go without. We can we should and we must do better.

“If we ask the hard questions we can fix this system so the survival that’s driving a tough medical diagnosis both physically and financially isn’t based purely on luck.”

Smith was one of dozens of residents and elected and appointed officials who addressed the insurance department Monday asking its leaders to dismiss a request by insurance companies to raise rates on next year’s health policies.

In addition to the substantial average increase on individual plans insurers who sell policies on and off Connecticut’s Affordable Care Act Exchange are seeking an average hike of 14.8% on small group plans.

The requests are substantially higher than what insurers sought last year for 2022 health policies. Carriers in 2021 asked for an average increase of 8.6% on individual plans and 12.9% on small group plans.

“I’ve been taking care of emergency patients in the tens of thousands … which means I’ve hopefully improved the health of tens of thousands of people. I know I’ve saved the lives of probably hundreds of people. And unfortunately in doing that I have also ruined the financial health of hundreds or thousands of people” Phil Brewer an emergency physician who has practiced for 40 years testified Monday. “I’ve said many times that I love what I do. But unfortunately as a result of what I do many of my patients end up going into bankruptcy. I have a strong opposition to these rate hikes.”

Three insurers are selling policies on Connecticut’s Affordable Care Act exchange: Anthem Health Plans CTCare Benefits Inc. and ConnectiCare Insurance Company Inc.

Anthem requested an average increase of 8.6% for individual policies that cover 27698 people. The proposed changes range from a decrease of 1.8% to an increase of 16.1% depending on the plan.

The company also sought an average hike of 3.6% on small group policies that cover 19271 residents. The suggested changes range from a decrease of 1.2% to an increase of 26.3%.

CTCare Benefits asked for an average hike of 24.1% on individual plans that cover 75003 people. Proposed changes range from an increase of 18.7% to 33.2% depending on the policy.

It also sought an average hike of 22.9% on small group plans that cover 3476 residents (increases range from 20% to 28.9%).

ConnectiCare Insurance which only sells individual policies on the exchange requested an average increase of 25.2% for plans that cover 8782 people. Suggested hikes range from 17.1% to 32.2%.

Several other companies including Cigna and Aetna are selling plans off the exchange.

Representatives from only two insurers — ConnectiCare and Cigna — attended and spoke at the public hearing Monday at the Legislative Office Building. A spokesman for the insurance department said only those two companies were invited because they had the highest rate requests of all the carriers. Cigna is seeking an average increase of 19.6% for its off-exchange small group plans. ConnectiCare Insurance asked for an average hike of 29.3% on its off-exchange small group policies.

Sarah Souza small group actuarial director for Cigna said even with the proposed increases for 2023 plans the company’s premiums would be lower than the market average.

“For silver plans which are the most popular amongst small employers we have the lowest plan in six out of the eight rating areas representing the vast majority of where small employers are located” she said.

“Percentage increases are all relative to the base figure. As such while we may have among the higher proposed increases we continue to have among the lowest actual out-of-pocket premium cost when all is said and done” added Wendy Sherry vice president of Cigna’s U.S. commercial markets.

ConnectiCare has attributed its proposed increases to rising medical and pharmaceutical costs as well as delayed care due to the pandemic.

Karen Moran ConnectiCare’s president said Monday that the company sustained over $65 million in losses in the individual market over the last year because rate increases have not kept up with higher utilization of medical services and the cost of prescription drugs among other expenses.

“For an insurance program to be sustainable rates must be adequate to provide for payment of claims and the administrative costs of running the program. For the past year the total insurance premiums we have received are far less than the cost of care we’ve actually funded” she said. “The premiums previously approved by the insurance department were significantly below what was necessary for us to meet the needs of the members. … The single most important driver in our proposed rate increase is to restore rates to an adequate level.”

“[Another] significant driver of the required premium is medical trend which is the increased cost of reimbursing health care providers” Moran said. “Utilization of medical and pharmacy services is exceeding pre-pandemic levels in 2022 and is expected to continue due in large measure to the needs of the people we serve.

“In short we have not requested any more than we absolutely need in order to remain part of the exchange.”

But residents and elected officials said many won’t be able to afford coverage if the proposed rate increases go into effect.

“I recently heard from a senior who explained that she was making a choice on whether she was going to go without food or health care or prescriptions” said Rep. Robin Comey D-Branford. “I know these hikes will push insurance even farther out of reach for so many people — young adults seniors and young families.

“Many people I’ve spoken with are planning on putting off their care at the expense of their long-term health and well being. … Our goal as a state should be to insure as many people as possible no matter their age their ZIP code or their racial and ethnic disparities.”

Rep. Holly Cheeseman R-East Lyme recounted her own ordeal purchasing insurance.

“If this were six years ago I would be sitting here as a member of the public when my husband died and my son and I had to take out individual policies. … I remember having a dog bite and deciding I was better off putting butterfly strips on it than going to the emergency room because I would have that full out-of-pocket cost” she said. “So I think we have to remember the price our residents are paying that their families are paying and indeed that the small businesses are paying.”

Attorney General William Tong asked representatives from the insurance companies if they perform an analysis of whether customers can afford their premiums before requesting an increase.

“From an actuarial standpoint that is not a consideration when we set rates” Neil Kelsey vice president and chief actuary for ConnectiCare replied. “Our rates cannot be excessive [they must be] non-discriminatory and they must be adequate. Those are the three stipulations or thresholds that the actuarial analysis has to comply with.”

Insurers identified the expiration of those expanded credits as one justification for the double-digit rate hikes. The credits are now expected to be extended through 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. That request was also denied. (Douglas Hook / Hartford Courant)

Sherry added that “it’s the competitive market that really helps to determine whether our rates are affordable.”

Tong said Connecticut families are “suffering.”

“They’re getting squeezed every which way” he said. “The price of gasoline home heating oil natural gas and electricity are still up. We paid 13% more for groceries last month than we did a year ago. … Rent housing all up. And so it is clear that Connecticut residents — individuals in the individual market small groups small businesses — cannot afford increases as high as 20.4% on average.”

Actuaries with the insurance department are now reviewing the requested increases. They will examine trends in unit cost (total expenditure incurred by the company) utilization of services and expected severity of claims as part of the process.

After the review the department can approve the full requested increase reject it or amend it to a different number. The final changes are expected to be published in late August or early September.

""Is your car supposed to be parked out front?"" the officer asked her.

Mason was confused. She had parked her car outside her building that Thursday night as she does every night. Unfortunately early that Friday morning her 2020 Kia Sorento was waiting for her at an impound lot.

The car was littered with trash the steering column peeled off and the dome lights removed. Mason said other things missing from the car were its manual and her friend's dog's ashes she was supposed to deliver the next day.

""I don't know why they would do that. It makes no sense. There was loose change and other things they didn't touch"" Mason said.

Mason said the theft has made her life difficult for the past month and she's not alone. Numerous people have reached out to her on social media sharing their experiences having their Kia or Hyundai vehicle stolen.

Mason is among those joining a lawsuit filed Friday against the automakers aiming to have them fix or replace these vehicles and compensate impacted car owners.

Cincinnati attorney Jeffrey Goldenberg with Goldenberg Schneider LPA filed a class action lawsuit against the automakers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California where the companies are based.

""Kia and Hyundai chose not to include what almost every other manufacturer includes in any model of their cars called an immobilizer device and these vehicles can easily be started without a key"" Goldenberg said. An immobilizer prevents the engine from starting unless the correct key is present. Goldenberg believes the automakers chose not to include an immobilizer device in these vehicles to cut costs.

California lawsuit seeks compensation fixes for Kia and Hyundai cars

The lawsuit argues the plaintiffs overpaid for these vehicles because they were not aware they lacked engine immobilizers making them more susceptible to thieves and thus are owed financial compensation.

The lawsuit also seeks the carmakers to take responsibility and install appropriate equipment to make them less susceptible to theft.

According to the lawsuit the impacted vehicles are Kia models from 2011-2021 and all Hyundai models from 2015-2021.

The firm said individuals can still join the class action lawsuit. Participation is not limited to only those who have had their cars stolen but any Kia and Hyundai owner whose vehicle is susceptible to the theft demonstrated in the viral videos. Several lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks including in federal courts in Ohio.

In a statement to The Enquirer Kia America said it is concerned about the increase in auto thefts of a subset of Kia vehicles.

""It is unfortunate that criminals are using social media to target vehicles without engine immobilizers in a coordinated effort. All of our vehicles meet or exceed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. While no car can be made theft-proof criminals are seeking vehicles solely equipped with a steel key and 'turn-to-start' ignition system. The majority of Kia vehicles in the United States are equipped with a key fob and 'push-button-to-start' system making them more difficult to steal"" the company said.

The automaker said all 2022 Kia models and trims have an immobilizer applied either at the beginning of the model year or as a running change.

Hyundai Kia thefts happening nationwide

Mason's Sorento was found abandoned about two miles away from her Pleasant Ridge home. Officers explained that based on how her vehicle was stolen it was probably part of a TikTok trend targeting Hyundai and Kia vehicles.

Detective Joseph Ruwe with the Delhi Township Police Department said what happened to Mason is all too common locally and across the country.

Videos on social media show car thieves how to peel off the steering column of a Hyundai or Kia vehicle and use a USB cable to start the cars. When Mason's Kia was stolen the thieves used a USB cable that was already inside her car.

Ruwe said that most of the thefts are being carried out by teenagers between the ages of 14 and 19 and they'll even steal multiple cars a night in some cases.

""They'll drive over in a stolen car and then if they find another one they'll park that one and then drive the new stolen car. Or if there are multiple people in the car they'll take another so each person has one"" Ruwe said.

Mason's Kia was in the shop for about 30 days. The parts needed to fix it were on back order due to the frequency of these thefts. Her insurance is helping with expenses but it cost her a $1000 deductible.

She is still waiting for a new cover for her steering column which may take weeks to get due to the high demand so in the meantime she'll have to drive with the wires hanging out.

""It's heartbreaking because it's just a game to them. It's a challenge to see how many cars they can steal in one night. So they had a game at my expense"" Mason said. ""And it's still not over. I'm terrified it's just going to get stolen again. It could get stolen tomorrow and I have no way to protect it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cm9uZ3Rvd25zLm9yZy9qb3VybmFsLzIwMjIvOC8xOC9zdHJvbmdlc3QtdG93bi1jb250ZXN0LXNpc3Rlci1jaXRpZXMtY29tZS10b2dldGhlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strongest Town Contest Sister Cities Come Together,"Dozens of aspiring towns entered the competition to be named 2022’s Strongest Town.

Berka was originally charged with two counts each of wire fraud and money laundering in a scheme in which she allegedly used her position within the company and her bank login credentials to embezzle approximately $2.7 million over three years.

A plea agreement filed Aug. 15 shows that Berka has agreed to plead guilty to one count each of wire fraud and money laundering. Between both counts Berka faces up to 30 years in prison and up to $500000 in fines.

The other two charges against Berka will be dismissed as part of the plea agreement. Berka has also been ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1.2 million to Bader Rutter as well as $1.5 million to The Cincinnati Insurance Company.

Berka was CFO of Bader Rutter from February 2006 to March 2018. The charges brought against her stem from incidents that occurred from July 2014 through September 2017.

According to a federal indictment filed against Berka she was given access to the company’s Health Funding Account (HFA) and was the only person who could initiate and approve payments from the account.

As part of a scheme Berka allegedly maintained a bank account in the name of “Furefriends Inc.” which is a former company that Berka owned and operated. The company dissolved in 2010 but its bank account which Berka also controlled and operated remained open.

Erling Haaland mengaku tak perlu diyakinkan untuk bergabung dengan Manchester City usai memutuskan hengkang dari Borussia Dortmund.

Pemain berusia 22 tahun itu memilih pindah ke Etihad Stadium ketika mengatakan ingin tantangan baru di pertengahan musim lalu. Beberapa bulan kemudian ia pindah ke bekas klub ayahnya dengan biaya £51 juta.

Faktor ayahnya menjadi salah satu alasan ia memilih untuk bergabung dengan City namun kesempatan untuk bekerja di bawah manajer hebat Liga Primer Inggris saat ini Pep Guardiola adalah motivasi yang lebih besar.

Artikel dilanjutkan di bawah ini

Mengapa Man City untuk Haaland?

Dalam sebuah wawancara dengan FourFourTwo Haaland memberikan banyak pujian untuk mantan manajer Barcelona itu atas kualitas kepelatihannya dan gaya permainan yang dia terapkan sepanjang karier manajerialnya.

""Yah Pep tidak harus mempromosikan klub kepada saya itu sudah pasti"" kata bintang Norwegia itu. ""Ia tidak harus mempromosikan apa pun. Sebagai permulaan ia adalah pelatih spesial dan itu sangat penting bagi saya.""

""Kita semua tahu apa yang telah ia lakukan untuk klubnya tapi juga untuk pemain dan untuk permainan secara umum. Itu adalah salah satu faktor saya ingin menjadi bagiannya. Saya pikir kami bisa bersenang-senang bersama.""

Tak lupa memuji klubnya Man City

Sementara Haaland masih sangat belia ketika ayahnya bermain untuk Manchester City ia tentu akan menemukan banyak hal-hal baru yang belum didapat ayahnya setelah memutuskan pindah ke Etihad.

Tim yang berbeda sekarang bermain di Etihad stadion baru daripada era Maine Road ketika ayahnya Alfie bermain di sana 20 tahun yang lalu meski nilai-nilai klub tetap terjaga.

""Sangat besar"" imbuh Haaland. ""Fasilitas yang ada staf orang-orang di sekitar klub ini adalah organisasi besar. Ini adalah klub yang sangat profesional melakukan segalanya dengan cara yang baik untuk membantu para pemain yang sangat saya sukai."""

Cisco reported Wednesday that revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was flat at $13.1 billion topping Wall Street estimates of $12.73 billion. Net income fell 6% to $2.8 billion.

For the current quarter Cisco forecast revenue growth between 2% and 4% year over year. For fiscal 2023 the company expected revenue to increase from 4% to 6%.

Revenue would be higher except for the difficulty in buying components executives said during an earnings call with analysts. Cisco has a record backlog of orders.

Without the supply constraints ""we would be growing much more quickly"" Cisco CFO Scott Herren said. He expects the component shortage to continue throughout fiscal 2023.

""There was some easing [in fiscal Q4] but it doesn't mean it's over"" Herren said.

COVID-19 lockdowns in Chinese manufacturing centers have raised havoc in the tech industry's global supply chain. However competitors Arista and Juniper Networks have navigated the disruption better than Cisco. As a result they have taken market share according to analysts.

In their most recent quarters Arista and Juniper Networks reported that year-to-year revenue rose 48.7% and 8% respectively. The companies also forecast revenue growth in their current quarters.

Chuck Robbins Chuck Robbins

Cisco has tackled its product backlog by paying higher-than-average component prices which have lowered margins Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said. The company expects to continue spending more over the next 60 to 90 days.

The company has done hundreds of product redesigns to bypass some component shortages. Those products will ship throughout the fiscal year.

In fiscal Q4 Cisco's supply deficit led to a revenue decline in routing and campus and data center switching Herren said. Meeting and calling products also suffered revenue drops.

""The teams are really focused on trying to get that back to growth"" Robbins said of the meeting platforms which include the Webex portfolio. ""But we've got a lot of work to do.""

Security revenue grew 20%. Other products with positive revenue growth included the Meraki wireless portfolio and collaboration hardware which grew 2%.

The weakest industry sectors for sales included retail healthcare and financial services. Otherwise ""pretty much strength across most of the rest of the sectors"" Herren said.

Cisco has not seen a change in customer demand from the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to lower inflation. ""We haven't seen a material demand signal change as we enter into [fiscal] Q1"" Robbins said.

In general customers' buying behaviors haven't changed other than looking for a quicker return on investment he said. ""That affects how they think about what products they're buying.""

In some cases customers were planning for 2023 ""but other than that we're not seeing anything significantly different"" Robbins said.

And then there are times like now when Cisco is a poster child for how the supply chains for chips and other components thanks to the coronavirus pandemic are constricting sales and profits.

Cisco finished off its fiscal 2022 year on July 30 and has just reported its financials for the fourth quarter and or the full year. Revenues in the quarter were as flat as a pancake at $13.1 billion and net income fell by 6 percent to $2.8 billion. For the full year Cisco managed to boost revenues by 3 percent to $51.6 billion and net income rose by 12 percent to $11.8 billion.

This is actually record annual revenue for Cisco which had a record quarter a year ago with 30 percent growth that made for a tough compare. (All comparisons are tough aren’t they?) As the fourth quarter ended Cisco posted a record year for product orders with orders up 15 percent sequentially from Q3 fiscal 2022 and up 14 percent year-on-year. Remaining performance obligations (which is not included in the product backlog the figure of which was not supplied) was over $31 billion and Cisco said on a call with Wall Street analysts that it expected that nearly $17 billion of that would be recognized in the fiscal 2023 year that will end next July. Cisco added that its software backlog was “north of $2 billion” but for some reason won’t give the hardware backlog.

That’s another way of saying that the supply chain boa constrictor is still squeezing but perhaps not as tight as it has in past quarters.

“After a challenging April due to the COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai and the impact on semiconductor and power supplies overall supply constraints began to ease slightly at the back half of the fourth quarter and are continuing into the start of Q1” Chuck Robbins Cisco’s chief executive officer explained on the call with Wall Street. “While the component supply headwinds remain they have begun to show early signs of easing. The decisions we made and the multiple actions we have taken over the past two years are helping to improve our resiliency and will help offset cost inflation. These include adding new suppliers leveraging alternative suppliers redesigning hundreds of products to use alternative components with similar capability and targeted price increases – all of which position us for the future.”

We will talk about guidance for the future in a minute but first let’s go over what Cisco could sell in the quarter. Here’s the breakdown by product groupings:

Product revenues were flat at $9.7 billion and services revenues were flat at $3.4 billion which is how the $13.1 billion overall revenue was also flat.

The core networking business which is called Secure Agile Networks was down 1 percent to $6.09 billion. Robbins said that supply chain constraints meant that datacenter switching and campus switching both declined in the quarter but the Catalyst ASR 9000 routers and Nexus 9000 routers both saw growth as did its Meraki wireless switching line. Access routing did well but edge and SD-WAN routing in the enterprise declined.

And interestingly enough Cisco had double-digit growth in servers but as has been the case for the past several years it did not elaborate further on its Unified Computing System converged server-switch business. Which is a shame because we want to know more about how that is doing specifically.

The Cisco service provider business which is under the Internet for the Future group and which includes cable optical and edge products was down 10 percent to $1.26 billion.

All of the other Cisco lines are interesting to many of us personally but don’t have jack to do with the datacenter. We only care about campus switching inasmuch as it helps the datacenter switching and routing vendors who do both to run a multi-cylinder engine which in theory helps smooth the business out a bit and to trickle down some technology that is mature in cheaper less capable machines.

As best as we can figure from our model the core Cisco server switch and routing businesses accounted for $6.59 billion in sales down 2.9 percent year on year. Here is the trend for that since fiscal 2009:

Paul Silverstein an analyst at investment bank Cowen made an interesting comment to Robbins during the Q&A that bears repeating and so does the reply from Robbins.

“From a big picture perspective once upon a time networking in general and Cisco in particular was the canary in the coal mine” Silverstein said. “When there was a macro downturn you guys were the first to see it networking was the easiest thing to push off everyone let their networks run hotter with the enterprise carriers et cetera that seems to flip where networking is actually not seeing weakness that other technology product markets are seeing.”

And here is how Robbins responded:

“I think you’re right. And I’ve said this repeatedly: I think what what’s driven this is two things. Number one the pandemic revealed the impact of not keeping your core infrastructure technology up to speed. Customers struggled and I think it made them realize that they had a lot of technology debt that needed to be dealt with. And they don’t want to get in that position again. But the second thing is all of these megatrends that I mentioned in my opening comments. These customers are re-architecting their entire infrastructure for the first time in years to deal with hybrid cloud and to deal with all of the mobile workers. We see IoT exploding. You see all of the climate activity is going to be a tailwind to our business because you have to connect all these industrial systems to be able to control them. You have got to shift to 400 GE. I’ll give you a data point: 400 GE ports were up almost 700 percent year-over-year for us. We have got over 1000 customers now that have bought 400 GE and we shipped our first 800 GE. All of these trends continue: You’ve got 5G you’ve got WiFi-6. You’ve got this application observability the re-architecture of applications. So I think it’s a combination of the realization of the pandemic brought on around technology debt and never letting them get to that point and then these megatrends that are going on.”

To that end Cisco thinks as it burns down one backlog it is going to be building up another one. Cisco has $19.3 billion in the bank down a smidgen from last year and $23.3 billion in deferred product revenue. So it is in good financial shape to deal with the existing backlog and build a new one and attack it. But it is not going to be easy to chew all of that backlog at least not based on the revenue projections for Q1 F2023 and all of F2023. Cisco is only projecting revenue growth of 2 percent to 4 percent for the first quarter ending in October and 4 percent to 6 percent for the full fiscal 2023.

The boa constrictor is still going to be wrapped around the company because the supply and demand conditions in the world are not changing. Cisco can only move so fast to find alternative suppliers for power supplies and other key components and we cannot predict what coronavirus monkeypox and flu might do to manufacturing operations around the globe."

Citigroup’s international broking business has been fined £12.5 million by the UK financial watchdog over past failures to properly apply rules designed to halt suspicious trading activity.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it had sanctioned Citigroup Global Markets for failing to adequately implement Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) trade surveillance rules.

MAR rules were introduced in 2016 to expand the responsibilities of banks when monitoring for potential market manipulation and insider trading.

The framework for market integrity depends on the partnership between the FCA and market participants using data to detect suspicious trading Mark Steward FCA

The FCA said the Citigroup arm “could not effectively monitor its trading activities” for certain types of illegal activity due to its failings.

It said there were gaps in the firm’s arrangements systems and procedures for trade surveillance until January 2018.

Citigroup Global Markets agreed to resolve the case and therefore saw the fine reduced from a potential £17.9 million sanction.

Mark Steward executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said: “The framework for market integrity depends on the partnership between the FCA and market participants using data to detect suspicious trading.

“By not fully implementing the new provisions when required Citigroup Global Markets did not carry its full weight in this partnership impacting market integrity and the overall detection of market abuse.”

A spokeswoman for Citigroup said: “Citi is pleased to put this matter behind us.”"

Relaxing at her home in southern California Allyson Felix received an unexpected phone call asking if she would return to the world championships in Oregon and help out her fellow U.S. athletes one last time in the women’s 4x400m relay.

After nearly two decades and five Olympic Games official retirement could wait just a few more days. The seven-time Olympic champion obliged. She ran in the preliminaries as summoned and then cheered on her teammates including young star Sydney McLaughlin the following evening in the final.

“It was really neat the stadium was full and it was really fun to do one last race - it was totally unexpected” Felix said in a Zoom interview with Around the Rings.

The 36-year-old athlete’s un-retirement resulted in yet one more World Championship gold medal increasing her career medal total to 20 including 14 gold.

Felix appears to confirm with a laugh that retirement is now officially official.

“I think this is going to stick this time - I’m looking forward to this next chapter of life” she said.

“I just feel really fulfilled with everything – it was a really nice way for me to end it and embrace and enjoy the last season” she says alluding to her final trip around the track in Oregon.

Of Felix’s 31 total Olympic and World Championship medals 21 were gold – the most combined Olympic and world titles among any athlete in track and field history. New challenges lie ahead.

Making new strides as part of the IOC Athletes’ Commission

Felix says she wishes to “stay connected” to track and field and the sport’s athletes in her retirement while also caring for her three-year-old daughter Camryn at home.

The athletics icon – who was honored in Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2020 & 2021 – believes she can make an immediate impact in her new position on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athletes’ Commission. Felix was recently appointed to the commission on July 27.

“I’m really excited to really bring my perspective to the position – of course I have my agenda that I’d like to get done and that’s really focused on women and supporting them in the Olympic movement” Felix tells ATR.

“There are definitely things that can be done in a better way and working with other athletes with different perspectives from other countries to have the athletes’ voice represented” she said.

Felix who stepped onto the track and first into the Olympic spotlight at Athens 2004 at age 18 says she is pleased with the positive strides she has witnessed particularly regarding gender equality within the Olympic movement over her journey across five Olympic Games.

“I think there has been progress made for sure” Felix says. “There is good momentum especially in a sport like track and field and a bit more equality than with some of the other sports.

“As I evolved as an athlete and as I became a mother my eyes were open to different areas where we can do better.

“I have learned a lot throughout the process and there are so many things that we can be critical of but from an athletes’ perspective it really changed my life positively.”

LA28 in her own backyard

Felix (third from right) alongside fellow members of the LA bid team in Lausanne June 2017 (Pinelli)

Felix grew up in Santa Clarita California located 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. She says she is thrilled about the return of the Games to her hometown and already began making a contribution having served as an athlete ambassador during the L.A. bid phase.

The native Californian was front and center in Lausanne when Thomas Bach and the IOC declared L.A. would be awarded the 2028 Olympics while Paris hosts 2024 in June 2017.

Felix believes LA28 organizers are off to a fast start something that she knows a thing or two about.

“There are a lot of athletes involved in the organizing process and I think that’s the first step” Felix says. “They’re talking about the process.

“The venues are incredible and I think everything has been done in a thoughtful way and they just have to keep the evolvement up with such a long lead-way to prepare.

“I think it will be great from a city standpoint but hopefully for the Olympic Movement as well. Los Angeles is such a great city it’s so diverse and has so much to offer.

In her position on the LA28 Athletes Commission Felix naturally wants to execute a perfect baton pass to future Olympians.

“I just want to be a great experience where athletes can focus on their performance and it’s a seamless experience for them.

“I hope that it will be a win for everyone.”

Partnership with Clorox brands

Felix has always been focused on a ‘clean start’ out of the blocks.

Now finally retired the most decorated women’s Olympic track and field athlete in history and mom is teaming up with Clorox to help champion parents to ‘start clean’ with the new school year just ahead.

“As a mom that wears a lot of different hats I realize how hard it is to juggle it all especially during the back-to-school season which is also the kickoff to the cold and flu season so I’m just excited to help parents” Felix said.

“By eliminating some illness by focusing on what we can control disinfecting and keeping our kids out of contact with a lot of germs.”

“Clang Clang Clang Went Josh Hawley” “Rudolph the Leaky Reindeer” “A Spoonful of Clorox” “Kamala!” — Rainbow’s clever political parodies of show tunes and pop songs intercut with his sardonic fake interviews with real politicians draw millions of viewers. He’s been self-producing them for a decade writing the song lyrics and interview scripts crafting the wardrobe wigs and makeup performing and editing the video often all within a couple of days.

Where did this guy come from?

Florida of course.

He’ll tell you all about it in his dishy funny and sometimes poignant memoir “Playing With Myself.” Yes it’s a naughty title — he can’t help himself — but it’s also a reference to his DIY aesthetic and his introverted personality. No I’m serious he’s serious stop that snickering. He can turn on that fabulously gay persona in front of a camera or on stage but the real Randy Rainbow is more complicated.

First of all Randy Rainbow really is his name the one his parents gave him at birth. “My name may seem perfectly on-brand now” he writes “but frankly that’s only because I had no choice but to grow into it!”

When he was born the Rainbows lived on Long Island. It was a “show-biz positive family” — his father and grandfather were musicians his great-grandmother a performer in Yiddish theater and the Borscht Belt.

So his folks took it in stride when 8-year-old Randy put on a backyard performance of “Snow White” with himself in the starring role wearing a pair of pajama pants on his head to represent Snow’s long hair. He got a standing ovation. For 1989 he writes “this was certainly a progressive audience.”

His doting mom who is a big presence in this book signed him up for dance lessons when he was 5 and took him to see “The Nutcracker.” Two years later he was starring in it as Fritz the “bratty little brother” with a “fierce pirouette solo.” She also counseled her son about dealing with the bullies at school who zeroed in on “boys like me.”

When he was 9 his parents’ marriage fractured and he moved with his mother and her mother his beloved Nanny to Cooper City near Fort Lauderdale. He credits Nanny not only with being his biggest supporter but with being a role model for his comic form. “She always had the TV on at her house and would walk around talking back to it all day. If a celebrity or politician was being interviewed she’d respond to the TV as though she were conducting the interview herself. I frequently notice myself mimicking a lot of her style and rhythm in my videos. I’m basically just an old lady talking back to her television set.”

Rainbow writes about coming out as a teenager which surprised no one in his family but intensified the tension between him and his father from whom he ended up being estranged.

He writes about moving to New York to pursue his showbiz dreams with his own special version of waiting tables while trying to get parts: He did a stint as the only male host at a Hooters at Broadway and 56th Street. He had a blast but he writes “I must have single-handedly depressed more Wall Street stockbrokers than the Crash of 1929.”

Other jobs led more directly to where he wanted to be and by 2010 he was writing and making videos for Broadway publications and websites. Then the Mel Gibson viral audiotapes hit the fan with the enraged actor “spewing vile racist misogynistic homophobic and anti-Semitic rants on phone calls with his former girlfriend.”

A friend suggested Rainbow make a video about Gibson and he ran with it deciding to “highlight the absurdity and grotesqueness of the situation by mocking it directly in character.”

He texted his friend “I should date him.”

In the first video he filmed himself walking around his apartment and having a phone conversation with Gibson intercutting the vile clips with himself asking with “lovey-dovey composure” what Mel wanted for dinner.

It went “viral-ish” he writes with 100000 views — in 2010 amazing numbers. The Gibson videos would launch Rainbow’s career and as he writes in a later chapter come back to bite him 10 years later when trolls took pieces of them out of context as part of an effort to cancel him.

But before that his career got a much bigger boost thanks to the 2016 presidential race. As soon as Donald Trump became the GOP nominee Rainbow’s video “Ya Got Trump Trouble” based on “Ya Got Trouble” from “The Music Man” got 5 million views in a day. Within 24 hours of the first debate he’d posted “Super Callous Fragile Egocentric Braggadocious” which scored 16 million views.

Rainbow writes that during the Trump administration he felt like the musicians on the Titanic who “performed in an effort to keep everyone calm.” Then the pandemic hit a “second iceberg” bringing his touring show to a halt as his videos attracted an even bigger audience. (His stage show is back in business; he’ll bring The Pink Glasses Tour to Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater this week.)

He writes with pure fanboy joy about the showbiz idols he’s met and become friends with through his work: Stephen Sondheim Carol Burnett Patti Lupone. And finally in 2021 looking for the perfect tune for a video about the “new GOP breakout star” Marjorie Taylor Greene he chose “Evergreen.” That video led to a gig creating a video for the release of a new album by his greatest idol the woman he calls “my lord and savior Barbra Streisand.”

When he reports to his mother that Streisand has texted him — “Dear Randy Your musical and visual creativity are like buttah!” — Mom responds “She couldn’t be bothered to pick up the phone?”

Here's How To Keep Kids Healthy As They Return To ...,"skynesher/E+/Getty Images

Back-to-school season is here and a return to classrooms can often mean a return to an environment filled with germs that your child can come in contact with and bring home. And we all know the bad germs can leave our littles and not-so-little ones under the weather — and parents too. The return to school is the beginning of the cold and flu season but COVID-19 also seems to be here to stay and other health concerns are top of mind for parents this new year including cases of polio and the spread of monkeypox both we’re still learning about. But this time of year doesn’t have to leave parents bracing for runny noses and calling out sick to tend to a child with a cold. If you take precautions namely disinfecting high-touch surfaces in your home and helping your kid get a good night’s rest and eat well your family can do a better job of keeping germs at bay.

We spoke with Eva Beaulieu MD a board-certified internal medicine hospitalist and Clorox spokesperson about such concerns as the brand recently did a study and a survey that identified 69% of parents are concerned about their kids bringing germs home from school and that kids’ school clothes were among the germiest at 28 times germier than a toilet seat. She’s sharing advice on how to keep the whole family as healthy as possible as children go back to a mask-free way of learning from start to finish this school year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvc2FjaGVlbi1saXR0bGVmZWF0aGVyLWpvaG4td2F5bmUtY2FtZS0yMTUxMDA1MDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sacheen Littlefeather: John Wayne 'Came Forth' to 'Assault' Me at the 1973 Oscars but Was 'Restrained by Six Security ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='uk.movies.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /movies/sacheen-littlefeather-john-wayne-came-215100505.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B889D5A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvc2FjaGVlbi1saXR0bGVmZWF0aGVyLWpvaG4td2F5bmUtY2FtZS0yMTUxMDA1MDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Ahead of the release traders had been evenly divided between an increase of 50 basis points (bps) and an increase of 75 bps according to CME Group based on fed funds futures data. However after the release of the minutes a majority of traders were betting on a 50-bp increase at the meeting.

In the minutes Fed officials signaled that while they would continue to hike interest rates to bring down inflation it “would likely be appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases.” Some officials indicated that once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level it would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to the Fed's target rate of 2%.

Policymakers also acknowledged the risk of overdoing rate increases. “Many participants remarked that in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in monetary policy’s effect on the economy there was also a risk that the Committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary” the minutes said.

Federal Reserve officials will gather next week to discuss monetary policy and the economy at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole symposium on August 25 to 27.

""The Fed is likely to gain even more confidence in its rate-raising plans and pace given the continued strength of the labor market and the resiliency of consumer spending despite the fact that inflation remains near 40-year highs. Stock investors are feeling that confidence and have been putting money back to work across sectors driving the S&P 500 up more than 10% in the past month"" mentioned Caleb Silver Editor-in-Chief of Investopedia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMDc3NjEvcmFyaWJsZS1uby1mZWUtYm9yZWQtYXBlLW5mdC1tYXJrZXRwbGFjZS1hcGVjb2lu0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzEwNzc2MS9yYXJpYmxlLW5vLWZlZS1ib3JlZC1hcGUtbmZ0LW1hcmtldHBsYWNlLWFwZWNvaW4_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rarible Proposes No-Fee Bored Ape NFT Marketplace for ApeCoin Users,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='decrypt.co', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /107761/rarible-no-fee-bored-ape-nft-marketplace-apecoin (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159B7CC9210>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xMDc3NjEvcmFyaWJsZS1uby1mZWUtYm9yZWQtYXBlLW5mdC1tYXJrZXRwbGFjZS1hcGVjb2lu0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzEwNzc2MS9yYXJpYmxlLW5vLWZlZS1ib3JlZC1hcGUtbmZ0LW1hcmtldHBsYWNlLWFwZWNvaW4_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that civilisation in future will mostly be solar-powered.Musk took to Twitter and said that nearly all of Earth 's energy comes from the Sun ""We would be a dark iceball at near absolute zero if not for the Sun. And essentially the entire ecosystem is solar-powered"" he stated.""Civilisation uses a tiny amount of energy by comparison. Not hard to generate from wind/solar"" he added.Musk has been confident on building business on solar energy and runs the Tesla Solar vertical. This provides panels for rooftops along with energy storage solutions.Tesla's solar business deployed a total of 106 megawatts in Q2 2022.""Although we continue to experience import delays beyond our control on certain solar components we have expanded our supplier base to enable growth in this business"" said the company.Compared to the same quarter last year Tesla upped solar deployments by 25 per cent.Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 and in April this year a US judge has sided with Musk in a hefty lawsuit brought by Tesla shareholders which accused the executive of coercing the electric vehicle company's board into buying SolarCity originally launched in 2006 by Musk's cousins.Tesla solar panels are designed to be highly efficient delivering maximum solar production year-round even on roofs with complicated angles.Its home storage solution 'Powerwall' is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery stationary home energy storage product manufactured by Tesla Energy which stores electricity for solar self-consumption.(With inputs from agencies)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC90ZWxhbmdhbmEtYmFycmVkLWZyb20taW5kaWFuLWVuZXJneS1leGNoYW5nZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtb3Zlci1wb3dlci1kdWVzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzNjQ4MzczLmNtc9IBmQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC90ZWxhbmdhbmEtYmFycmVkLWZyb20taW5kaWFuLWVuZXJneS1leGNoYW5nZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtb3Zlci1wb3dlci1kdWVzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzY0ODM3My5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telangana barred from Indian Energy Exchange transactions over power dues,HYDERABAD: Telangana power utilities have been barred from buying and selling electricity on power exchange platforms from August 19. The decision has been taken by the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) following a directive from the Union ministry of power to bar states having huge outstanding dues from power exchange transactions.This means Telangana can only utilise power from its own generation companies and get power from the generators with whom it has an agreement for supply.But it cannot purchase additional power for emergency requirements from private power generation companies through the IEX platform.Along with Telangana 12 other states including Tamil Nadu Andhra Pradesh  Bihar Maharashtra and Karnataka have been banned from doing power exchange transaction on IEX platform. Telangana is at the top with Rs 1380 crore dues while AP owes Rs 412 crore dues for the last seven months.Telangana Genco CMD D Prabhakar Rao is believed to have written to the Centre and IEX on Thursday urging them to review the decision. He said all pending arrears indicated in PRAAPTI portal have been cleared. “The Telangana high court issued an order in April this year allowing Telangana discoms and Telangana State Power Coordination Committee to operate through the power exchange as well as secure power through open access without any hindrance pending disposal of the writ petition.We urge the Centre not to take any further action and restrict the Telangana utilities either from drawing or selling power through the exchange” Prabhakar Rao said. Official sources said Telangana power utilities have been facing financial crisis in the last few years and owe Rs 3000 crore to solar power companies and other generators. The state government has recently asked the Centre to release about Rs 10000 crore to tide over the crisis. Official sources said the new rules framed by the Union power ministry over non-payment of dues by discoms andGencos will be applicable from August 19.“The limited supply rules bar discoms permanently from power exchanges if they do not pay pending dues to state Gencos immediately. The states have to cough up penalties and face action under the new electricity (late payment surcharge) rules” sources said. Genco officials said since the demand for power has come down due to the monsoon they can manage with regular power suppliers and their own generation companies.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV83MzQ2MTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Appeal to trace vehicle following fail to stop collision,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.energyfm.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /cms/news_story_734610.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000159BB13F850>, 'Connection to www.energyfm.net timed out.
