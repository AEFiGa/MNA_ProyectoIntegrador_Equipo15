How the skin heals determines how bright and of course how correct the tattoo looks. But worry not: all you need are a few tips and products to ensure a quick complete rebound.

We summoned some advice from Carl Kuo owner of Mission Ink Tattoo and Piercing in San Francisco. He offers ways to build habits that will preserve the ink’s color for years to come.

STEP 1: BANDAGE IT & let it heal

Pang

While each artist has a preferred method of covering fresh ink Kuo says that recovery is fastest with an ointment wrap — specifically Saniderm or 3M’s Tegaderm. “Leave it on for three to five days” he says. “You can shower with it but remove the wrapping if irritation develops at the edges of the wrap.” In addition avoid tight clothes and itching or scratching. If you follow these directions your skin should fully recover in under two weeks.

Retail sales volumes dropped by 1.6 per cent in monthly terms in August the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said – the biggest fall since December 2021 and worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a 0.5-per-cent fall.

The data are likely to add to worries about the strength of demand in Britain’s economy.

United Kingdom (UK) fashion retailers Primark and ASOS and online supermarket Ocado Retail have all warned about their profits this month.

The pound slid further towards USD1.14 on the back of the data.

“With a difficult winter to come it will come as a worry to retailers that shoppers have already reigned in their spending despite the hot summer” said retail lead at Accenture Lynda Petherick.

All of the main retail sectors – food stores non-food stores non-store retailing and fuel – fell over the month for the first time since July 2021 when COVID-19 restrictions on hospitality were lifted the ONS said.

The period of mourning following the death of Queen Elizabeth poses another challenge to retailers with widespread business closures due on Monday to mark the queen’s funeral.

“The sombre atmosphere in the UK this week and news of slow economic growth will be adding to the sense of concern among retailers as the weather gets colder” Petherick said.

Although inflation dipped below 10 per cent last month households are still grappling with the biggest price increases since the early 1980s caused mostly by surging energy prices in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The ONS said people cut back on furniture purchases last month.

“Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns” it said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This year’s survey included 5000 emoji users in the US looking for ways that emoji encapsulate our efforts in self-expression inclusion searching for love and communicating at work among other things. These “frequent emoji users” from California Florida Illinois New York and Texas filled out a 20-minute online survey about their emoji use and the results are 💯 👀 📈!

Don’t be a 🍆 use emojis.

Over 90% of US emoji users agreed that emojis make it easier for them to express themselves an overwhelming majority — though perhaps there is a bias in a sample drawn from people who self-define as “frequent emoji users” as presumably people who do not find that emojis make communication easier will not use them. An equal 91% of emoji users like to employ them to “lighten the mood of a conversation.” This makes sense because they are little cartoons (although as maligners of Clippy can tell you a cartoon does not help in every situation). I think we can generally agree that the presence of a little smiley face helps soften our tenth request that someone take out the trash that’s been sitting by the front door for two days 😉.

For the most part top emojis keep things light-hearted and positive but there’s always room to shed a single tear when times get hard.

The top five favorite emojis seem to be perennial faves in the emoji game: cry-laughing thumbs up red heart cry-laughing extra hard and single tear. These also feature in the top three favorite emoji combos a progressive cry-laugh to harder cry-laugh hearts-surrounding-face and a blown kiss and a blown kiss and heart. Love is in the virtual air! It is probably unsurprising that 68% of the survey respondents feel that their primary reason for using emojis is to make conversations more fun but it is interesting to note that 60% of users agree that using emojis has improved their mental health. It’s possible that this says more about the state of mental health care in the US than the healing power of emojis.

In a country without universal healthcare emojis might be the only mental health services widely available.

As broken down by Adobe’s analysis of the 111-page report despite their goofy lighthearted application they are also a showcase for ways that we confront serious social issues.

“Now more than ever we are having an important and overdue conversation about inclusivity equity and diversity” said the Adobe blog. “And because emoji are so integrated into our daily activities it is vital that they reflect the lives of as many people as possible. According to the survey age race/ethnicity culture and disability are the top four categories of inclusive emoji US emoji users would like to see expanded.”

Emojis seem to also play a substantial role in the love lives of texters with Gen Z in particular making — and even breaking — relationships over emoji usage. Leonardo DiCaprio better brush up his emoji game if he wants to keep dating 25-year-olds.

Break it to them gently say it with emojis.

Are emojis the best means of communication? As the survey shows even emoji users find them somewhat ambiguous with the top three misunderstood emoji being cowboy hat smiley cherries and upside-down smiley face. For the record I think these clearly mean: “YEEHAW!” “yum I love cherries” and “everything is pretty shitty but I am nonetheless smiling.” Right?

Apologies to everyone who is confused by my overuse of the yeehaw guy I assumed my message was clear. My message was “YEEHAW!”

Whether you love them or hate them the report makes it clear that fluency with emojis is a useful social skill in the digital age garnering likeability and credibility at work ease with romance and a general sense of friendly fun. Even if you don’t feel confident splashing them all over the place there is one sacred rule that seems to be universal: Don’t ever use 💩 or an unsolicited 🍆 unless you’re trying to end things on the rudest possible terms. In a divided world the great social unifier seems to be a dislike of the pile of poo emoji.

Thanks emoji for helping us find common ground. Happy texting!

For the lunch reception on Sept 17 at Buckingham Palace Kate Prince William King Charles and Queen Camilla gathered for the governors-general of the Commonwealth nations. While the Royal family has continued to wear black to show their mourning for the passing of Queen Elizabeth II that isn’t stopping many royal family members from paying homage in their own way.

Along with Meghan Markle wearing the diamond and pearl drop earrings that the Queen gifted her Kate wore something very dear to the late Queen. Oftentimes people saw the Queen in a public outing rocking her three-tiered pearl necklace. Kate decided to honor the Queen by paying homage to her and her style by wearing the necklace for the occasion. According to former assistant private secretary Sam Cohen the late Queen “wore the same pearl necklace every day” per Town & Country.

Along with the necklace Kate also wore the Queen’s earrings something she’s done a few times along with a brooch the Queen loved — all of which to be seen as loving tributes.

Queen Elizabeth II was a global icon for 70 years. Since ascending to the throne at the age of 25 the long-reigning sovereign has approached her historic role with poise and quiet confidence. But behind the veneer of monarchy Queen Elizabeth was the leader of a family and household through good times and bad. Robert Hardman’s new biography Queen of Our Times takes longtime royal fans behind the veil with unprecedented access to royal records friends staff and more as the legendary leader and the House of Windsor celebrates her landmark reign. This will surely be known as the definitive book on Queen Elizabeth II. Pre-order before its release in early 2023.

Some Airbnb hosts are charging cleaning fees and asking guests to complete a list of chores.

Frustrated travelers say they've been asked to mow the lawn take out the trash and wash the sheets.

The trend is causing some people to ditch short-term rentals for hotels WSJ reported Friday.

Some Airbnb hosts are requiring guests to complete lengthy chore lists on top of paying cleaning fees up to $375 the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Frustrated travelers have pushed back on social media with some saying they've been asked to take out the trash wash the sheets and even mow the lawn during their stay.

One TikToker @Melworeit said in a viral video that she decided not to book on Airbnb because it charged a $125 cleaning fee and asked guests to take out the garbage remove bed linens run the dishwasher and do a load of laundry.

The post amassed 66000 views and nearly 5000 comments many of which shared similar encounters with Airbnb chore lists.

""If I'm paying $229 a night to stay somewhere plus a $125 cleaning fee I'm not doing any laundry"" the TikToker said. ""I know it's like one load of laundry and it'll take me two minutes to do but it's the principle that really bothers me.""

Another Airbnb guest took to Reddit in July to ask if it was ""normal for a host to tell the guest to mow the lawn themselves?""

""Seems like a strange response given the premium being paid for staying here (to me at least) but if that's standard then I'll roll with it"" the user wrote. ""I just don't want to be penalized/charged/poorly reviewed for 'neglecting' the lawn if I don't do it.""

An Airbnb spokesperson told Insider that while hosts choose their own cleaning fees the company has provided recommendations for keeping the amount reasonable and suggests hosts consider not charging cleaning fees at all. According to the company 45% of global Airbnb listings do not charge a cleaning fee and for those that do the fee on average is less than 10% of the total reservation cost.

""Would you like guests to load dirty dishes into the dishwasher or strip the bed linen before checkout? If so consider charging a very minimal cleaning fee – or no fee at all"" the Airbnb host resource page on cleaning fees says. ""With a higher fee guests may expect to just walk away from your space at checkout as they would a hotel room.""

Kimanzi Constable a full-time digital nomad who has stayed in over 100 Airbnbs told Insider that some hosts have asked him to complete chores without providing basic cleaning and laundry supplies.

""Airbnb hosts have asked me to do chores such as take out the garbage when checking out do the dishes clean up and other measures to help the host despite me paying a cleaning fee which can be high these days. I'm more than happy to contribute — if I have the supplies needed"" Constable wrote. ""Hosts should either provide all the necessary items or scrap the cleaning fee entirely.""

Mary Healey who lives next door to where the shooting occurred said the neighborhood’s short-term rentals are out of hand. There is often loud partying at the property she said but the shooting was a next-level disruption.

“That bullet could have been through the garage and through my bedroom and in my head” she said. “It’s pretty scary.”

The non-fatal shooting happened near McDowell Road and North Hayden Road at 4 a.m. on Sept. 9. The victim was shot three times according to the Scottsdale Police Department. Police later arrested two people in connection with the shooting.

Opposition to Airbnbs and other short-term rentals was already significant in Scottsdale and other parts of the Valley. Some residents and elected officials say they make neighborhoods less safe and eat up the city’s desperately-needed housing supply.

A shooting has only added fuel to the fire as community leaders gear up to consider new local restrictions on short-term rentals.

In a written statement provided to The Republic Scottsdale Mayor David Ortega called the shooting “a tragic illustration of the problems that vacation rental homes are bringing to our neighborhoods” adding that “the sense of safety in this neighborhood is shattered.”

A representative for Airbnb said the property listing has been deactivated while the company investigates.

Short-term rentals and safety

Scottsdale has seen an explosion of Airbnbs Vrbos and other short-term rental listings in recent years. The New York Times recently dubbed the city the “bachelorette-party capital of the West"" in part because of the popularity of short-term rental homes where groups of friends can congregate.

Loud parties are a regular complaint to police but concerns about safety are not uncommon. Valley short-term rentals have been host to several shootings and other serious crimes including a 2020 incident where a teenager was shot during a house party.

Public safety concerns related to short-term rentals are popping up across the country. A 2021 study by Northeastern University found that higher rates of short-term rental listings in Boston neighborhoods were linked to increased crime. That’s likely because converting housing units into short-term rentals “undermines a neighborhood’s social organization” and its natural ability to “counteract and discourage crime” the study said.

Between July 1 2021 and June 1 2022 Scottsdale police were called to short-term rentals almost 800 times according to city data. And in the first six months of this year roughly half of the nuisance party police service calls citywide were to short-term rentals. A party might be considered a nuisance for many reasons according to Scottsdale Police including underage drinking litter excessive noise or traffic public drunkenness or fights.

In 2021 Scottsdale created a short-term rental working group to address the challenges created by the properties. The city has since enacted new rules based on recommendations from the group including a $1000 penalty for short-term rental owners who fail to respond within one hour to an emergency on their property when contacted by police.

The Scottsdale Police Department is also creating a short-term rental police squad to respond to calls a spokesperson said.

Many public officials and opponents of short-term rental housing in Arizona say short-term rental safety issues as well as concerns of depleting housing stock and driving up rent costs for residents stem in part from a 2016 state law that prohibits cities and towns from banning short-term rentals.

“This hands-off anything goes attitude you wind up with shootings” said Bill Hunter a Paradise Valley resident and co-founder of Neighbors Not Nightmares a community group that advocates against short-term rentals.

While cities still cannot prohibit short-term rentals a new state law that takes effect this month will give municipalities more leeway to crack down on nuisance properties. The law will allow cities and towns to require short-term rental owners to obtain a license from the municipality. It will also enable municipalities to suspend the licenses of properties that violate local or state law three times in one year.

Ortega said the Scottsdale City Council is planning on reviewing a draft ordinance for a local license requirement on Sept. 20.

Impact on housing affordability

As Arizona grapples with an affordable housing crisis housing advocates worry that vacation rentals are gobbling up homes and depleting the housing stock available for full-time residents.

The state needs 270000 additional homes to tackle its housing crisis according to the Arizona Department of Housing. If short-term rentals were available for residents it would chip away at the housing shortage. There are almost 6000 active Airbnb and Vrbo listings in Scottsdale alone according to AirDNA a company that tracks short-term rental data. Most of those listings are for entire homes not single rooms.

In a recent report the Arizona Housing Coalition said cities’ inability to restrict short-term rentals is one of several barriers to affordable housing in the state particularly in high-tourism areas like Sedona Flagstaff and Scottsdale. Former Sedona City Manager Justin Clifton told The Arizona Republic in 2019 that short-term rentals accounted for 20% of the city’s entire housing stock.

The Arizona Housing Coalition report highlights steps other communities have taken to balance short-term rentals with preserving their affordable housing: Chicago imposed a tax surcharge for short-term rentals that funds a local housing trust fund and Vail Colorado created a program that incentivizes residents to put a restriction into their home's deed so that only full-time residents can buy or rent it.

Kate Bauer co-founder of the Arizona Neighborhood Alliance said constructing more housing won’t solve Arizona’s housing shortage until the short-term rental market is under control.

“If you don’t fix this problem you’re never going to fix the housing problem” Bauer said. ""You can’t keep building what will essentially be investments for people and not homes for people.”

However the venue will change.

The state hockey tournaments will move from its longstanding site at Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Alliant Energy Center.

The new home for the state tournaments will be Bob Suter’s Capitol Ice Arena in Middleton.

The decision was made official when the WIAA Board of Control at its meeting Friday approved a WIAA executive staff recommendation to move the tournaments to Capitol Ice Arena effective in March 2023.

The WIAA agreement with the Alliant Energy Center expired and WIAA assistant director LeVar Ridgeway had been working on determining a location for the 2023 boys and girls state hockey tournaments WIAA communications director Todd Clark wrote in an email. Ridgeway worked with the coaches advisory committee Clark said.

“We are excited about the opportunity to host the upcoming WIAA boys and girls state hockey championships at Bob Suter’s Capitol Ice Arena” Ridgeway said in a statement Friday. “With the move we look forward to creating a great state championship atmosphere for our student-athletes coaches and fans in a hockey-centric facility.”

The WIAA and the Capitol Ice Arena agreed to a two-year term.

The boys and girls state tournaments are scheduled March 2-4. The competition time schedule will be slightly altered to accommodate the change in venue according to a WIAA release.

Built in 1999 the venue received a multi-million dollar renovation in 2018 that added significant amenities and upgrades according to the WIAA release. The facility has two full sheets of ice. There is seating for 2611 spectators a state-of-the-art sound system scoreboard and a high-definition video board.

The arena also has a media broadcasting booth eight public locker rooms six public bathrooms one family restroom and is the current home for the USHL Madison Capitols and Madison Capitols AAA hockey.

“We are thrilled to be hosting the WIAA state tournaments for the next two years” Bob Suter’s Capitol Ice Arena president Ryan Suter said. “We are thankful to the WIAA for entrusting us with this historic event and believe our venue will provide an incredible atmosphere for the players and fans. We look forward to working with the WIAA and the city of Middleton to host this event and crown state champions.”

Said Wisconsin Hockey Coaches Association president Brian Brandt: “The Wisconsin Hockey Coaches Association is excited about this option for the WIAA state hockey tournaments. The WIAA and WHCA have worked collaboratively to give the best experience for our athletes and showcase their talents in an exciting environment.”

The WIAA began sponsoring state tournaments in boys hockey in 1971. Superior defeated Madison West 7-3 in the first championship game.

The first state tournament was held at the Dane County Coliseum prior to the venue’s name changing to Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Alliant Energy Center.

Hartmeyer Ice Arena also had been the site for some state tournament games but the Coliseum was used since 1980 according to historical information on the WIAA website.

The tournament had been conducted in Madison every year except in 1974 and 1975 when it was in Green Bay and in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic when the championship games were at South Wood County Rink in Wisconsin Rapids. Semifinals that year were at the home of the higher seeds.

The state tournament series for boys hockey expanded to two divisions in 2020.

The WIAA began sponsoring a state tournament in girls hockey in 2001-02. The state girls hockey tournament has been held in conjunction with the boys tournament since the sport was added.

In other news from the meeting in Stevens Point the Board of Control reviewed and approved a non-football fast track conference realignment request moving Burlington Catholic Central to the Midwest Classic Conference beginning in the 2023-24 school year.

The Board of Control approved updates to the executive staff handbook new appointments to the conference realignment task force and an endorsement of a sports-related injury surveillance study funded by the National Federation of State High School Associations according to a release from Clark.

Co-founder Jody Redman of InSide Out Initiative made a presentation. After that the Board of Control supported a three-year partnership with the Green Bay Packers for the InSide Out Wisconsin Initiative which “is intended to connect NFL teams with educational and athletic leadership associations to inspire and equip school leaders and communities to transform lives through purpose-based sports” according to the release. The program is scheduled to begin Jan. 10 2023.

The WIAA executive staff gave reports reviewing ongoing efforts to recruit and retain officials recent WIAA area meetings 2022-23 membership renewals and fall tournament series preparations.

Google Maps is widely regarded as one of the best most reliable navigation apps for both Android and iOS devices. But the app isn't for everyone. Whether you have particular needs in a navigation app that Google Maps just isn't meeting or you simply don't want an app made by Google there are a ton of great alternatives. (If you don't want an app owned by Google you should avoid Waze as well.)

There's never going to be a perfect navigation app for everyone because people have different needs. If you drive your own car to work every day the best app for you is going to be different than the best app for someone who frequently goes on long-distance road trips where they don't have service or someone who uses public transit to get around. Many of the navigation apps on this list have similar features with unique user interfaces and customizations but there are some that are wildly different and focus on one or two modes of transportation.

Whatever you need one of these apps is bound to be perfect for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTE4L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1kb2xsYXItbWF5LWJlY29tZS1yYXJlLWdsb2JhbC13aW5uZXItYXMtbWFzLXRpZ2h0ZW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore Dollar May Become Rare Global Winner as MAS Tightens,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bloomberg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=cd6484b4-1103-11ef-830c-64ac426107c7&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi0wOS0xOC9zaW5nYXBvcmUtZG9sbGFyLW1heS1iZWNvbWUtcmFyZS1nbG9iYWwtd2lubmVyLWFzLW1hcy10aWdodGVucw== (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239504E2170>, 'Connection to www.bloomberg.com timed out.

Google Maps is widely regarded as one of the best most reliable navigation apps for both Android and iOS devices. But the app isn't for everyone. Whether you have particular needs in a navigation app that Google Maps just isn't meeting or you simply don't want an app made by Google there are a ton of great alternatives. (If you don't want an app owned by Google you should avoid Waze as well.)

There's never going to be a perfect navigation app for everyone because people have different needs. If you drive your own car to work every day the best app for you is going to be different than the best app for someone who frequently goes on long-distance road trips where they don't have service or someone who uses public transit to get around. Many of the navigation apps on this list have similar features with unique user interfaces and customizations but there are some that are wildly different and focus on one or two modes of transportation.

Whatever you need one of these apps is bound to be perfect for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTE4L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1kb2xsYXItbWF5LWJlY29tZS1yYXJlLWdsb2JhbC13aW5uZXItYXMtbWFzLXRpZ2h0ZW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore Dollar May Become Rare Global Winner as MAS Tightens,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTE4L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1kb2xsYXItbWF5LWJlY29tZS1yYXJlLWdsb2JhbC13aW5uZXItYXMtbWFzLXRpZ2h0ZW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950F9F3D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The cheapest base model had paltry storage bitsy battery life and a slow low-resolution screen. Meanwhile the extravagant Kindle Oasis luxuriated in its sleek aluminum chassis fully adjustable lighting big battery and physical buttons for turning pages.

But the models have slowly begun to blend together with the less expensive Kindles adopting premium features previously only found in the Oasis. The mid-tier Paperwhite got some sprucing up in 2021 when Amazon added adjustable lighting and a USB-C port. (It’s still WIRED's pick for best e-reader.) At last Amazon is juicing up the base-model Kindle as well.

The new Kindle gets an upgraded display—a 300-ppi-resolution screen versus the previous Kindle’s 197 ppi. Storage is doubled to 16 GB. The new Kindle also—finally!—features a USB-C port like the newest Paperwhite models. It charges in as little as two hours over USB-C.

Unfortunately the prices have started to converge too. The new base-model Kindle costs $100 which is 10 bucks more than the previous version. Spend another $20 and you get a version that doesn’t bombard you with ads on the lock screen.

Here’s some more news from the world of consumer technology.

Alexa Speaks Brand

The worst thing about searching for something on Google is all the ads that show up at the top of the page. Well now Amazon is planning something like that for its Echo smart speakers.

In a blog post with the not-at-all-dystopian title “Alexa Can Now Help Brands Answer Customer Questions” Amazon laid out a new business strategy that will allow brands to provide answers to user questions that might relate to the products the brand wants to sell. Amazon gave an example of asking Alexa how to remove pet hair from the carpet. Such a query could cause a brand-backed response to spring forth offering to send you links to Amazon pages selling the brand’s products.

In Amazon’s brand registry system sellers will be able to view common user questions and attach their branded answers to them. Amazon says the questions and branded answers will be reviewed by content moderators before they can be used by Alexa. Amazon insists these are not ads and that brands won’t be able to pay to submit answers. The company also says branded answers will be attributed to the brand that answered them but it didn’t elaborate on what form that disclosure would take.

The company plans to test the feature starting in October then roll it out across the US after that.

TikTok Wants to BeReal

Every app is trying to be TikTok but sometimes the viral video-sharing app has to play a bit of catch-up itself.

If you are hip and cool (read: young) then surely you know about BeReal. The popular app prompts users with a notification at a random time every day that reads “Time to BeReal.” Users then have two minutes to snap a photo that captures images from both the front and back cameras. The results are quick and candid; the point of catching people unawares is to encourage more “authentic” moments than the carefully staged shots you see on platforms like Instagram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9mb3Jlc3QtaXNsYW5kcy1jcmVhdGVkLWluLWFtYXpvbi1hcmVudC13b3JraW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thousands of forest islands created in the Amazon rainforest aren't working — here's why,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='interestingengineering.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /culture/forest-islands-created-in-amazon-arent-working (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950BA7550>, 'Connection to interestingengineering.com timed out.

That's the outlook from airlines and the tourism industry going into the fall travel season and looking forward to the winter holidays.

Hopper a travel agency that analyzes data for airfare price predictions is seeing strong booking demand for holiday travel after an ""extraordinary"" summer.

The pent-up demand after two pandemic years is in part because for some travelers this will be the first time they visit family for the holidays since COVID-19 erupted said Hopper spokeswoman Lindsay Schwimer.

""Last year omicron was surging around the holiday season so people will be eager to take holiday trips this year and see family and friends"" she said.

Expect huge demand for holiday flights in 2022

Though it's too early to tell just how busy the fall and winter holidays will be – AAA doesn't issue its seasonal travel outlooks until two weeks before the holiday – some indicators suggest travelers should expect end-of-year travel will be just as busy as the summer.

TripAdvisor's fall travel survey which forecasts trends from September to November showed 6 of 10 Americans plan to travel this fall. About 49% plan to fly.

At the Cowen 2022 Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference which took place virtually American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the airline's leisure bookings ""remain strong"" past Labor Day.

""As we take a look forward into the future I'm pleased with how we've managed through the summer and rebounded through the pandemic"" he said.

Airlines are hiring more workers

This summer was a challenge for flying: Many flights were delayed or canceled. Staffing shortages were a big contributor to that.

About 2.3 million fewer aviation jobs existed worldwide in September 2021 down 21% from pre-pandemic levels according to Oxford Economics. That included about 340000 fewer jobs in the airline industry.

Airlines are taking steps to improve their operations.

U.S. airline employment in June 2022 increased by 6775 workers to a total of 767263 including 458136 full-time passenger airline workers according to the most recent data from the Department of Transportation. That's an increase from the same month in 2019 before the pandemic.

Three airlines drove the increase: Delta Air Lines hired 2981 people that month United Airlines added 1322 and Southwest Airlines added 1007.

A more luxurious option:KLM introduces Premium Comfort to New York

Airlines for America a trade group representing U.S. airlines said its seven-member passenger carriers – Alaska American Delta Hawaiian JetBlue Southwest and United – were staffed with 10% more pilots per block hour compared with before the pandemic.

(In the airline industry block hours measure the time from when an aircraft's door closes at departure to when it opens at arrival.)

American Airlines hired about 12000 people across a variety of job categories last year Isom said during the conference. He also said the company is ""making good progress"" as American continued hiring through the summer to prepare for the coming months.

But there will be fewer flights this fall

Despite the staffing growth airlines still don't have enough workers to meet the demand.

Many responded by removing flights from their schedules.

""Flight schedules for September and October are down by 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels and carriers are reducing September flights by 5% compared to what was planned at the start of the summer"" Airlines for America spokeswoman Marli Collier said.

""Airlines set their schedules months in advance and are constantly evaluating to optimize performance and prioritize smooth operations.""

Mother-daughter pilot duo:Pair makes history at Hawaiian Airlines

American Airlines which operates the majority of flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport recently published its final schedule for November that showed 30000 fewer flights.

A spokesman for American Airlines Brian Metham said the airline works off what it calls a ""placeholder schedule"" which is published about a year in advance and adjusts it closer to the time the flights are scheduled.

Its final schedule is published about 100 days in advance he said. On average American operates nearly 5300 departures daily nationwide.

American's full-year flight capacity for 2022 is forecast to end about 7.5% to 9.5% lower than before the pandemic Metham said.

How to book your holiday 2022 flights

► Don't delay: Industry experts suggest travelers book their flights as soon as possible.

Now through Oct. 20 is when consumers will find the best airfares for Thanksgiving and the December holidays Schwimer said. Higher prices and limited options are likely after mid-October.

""There are still deals available now for the holidays which is why we recommend booking as soon as you see a price you’re comfortable with"" she said.

► Save money by flying off-peak: Avoiding peak travel days can result in savings.

Expedia found in its flight data for Thanksgiving that travelers could save an average 5% on airfare by flying on the Sunday Monday or Tuesday before the holiday instead of Wednesday.

""For some destinations the savings are even bigger – average ticket prices for Las Vegas for example drop from around $550 to $380 (round trip) just by changing the departure date to earlier in the week"" said Francheska Taveras spokeswoman for the Expedia Group.

► The two best days to fly: For travelers flexible on their dates or waiting until the last minute Schwimer said the best deals for the holidays are when the fewest travelers are expected: Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve.

“It’s beautiful to see those new power lines” Elder Uchtdorf said. “I was told that before [the community was electrified] everyone tried to clean up their properties to make it a real occasion for when the light was turned on. The light was brought in and I think that’s what we need to do — we need to bring light to people.”

Elder Uchtdorf also applauded the multiagency efforts to fund the project through various state and Navajo Nation resources.

“We are only adding to those [contributions] from the community” the Apostle said. “The Church is so grateful when we can pitch in and help and it shows when we counsel together we are all on the same team. I think if we move closer together and lift where we stand no situation in the world could keep us from being successful.”

Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) water services will also be brought into the Diné community with the project expected to be completed in the spring of 2023. The project also procures a new deepwater well for Blanding City.

Lena Hutchinson-Lovell is one of about 100 residents who live in the Westwater community where 19 of 29 lots have been electrified since September 1. Previously Hutchinson-Lovell’s family relied on a generator for their energy needs. Other homes also relied on alternative power sources such as domestic wind turbines and solar panels.

“We never had electricity. We used flashlights and kerosene lanterns. The generator was costing us $20 per day to fill up the gas to last for six hours” Hutchinson-Lovell said. “Now that I can turn on the porch light it keeps my kids safe at night when they come home late. It feels good.”

“It’s a small group and about 100 people affected — but are we our brother’s keeper? I think we are” Elder Uchtdorf said. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s one or two or a thousand or 29 homes. When we are here we see the need and that’s what we need to do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvZW5lcmd5L3NvbGFyLXBvd2VyL1VTLXNvbGFyLXBvbHlzaWxpY29uLXN1cHBseS1wcm9ibGVtLzEwMC9pMzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The US solar industry has a supply problem,"In brief Chinese companies produce over three-quarters of the world’s polysilicon which is at the heart of solar panels. Some solar industry groups and researchers say that level of concentration poses a risk to the solar supply chain. They also argue that moving production elsewhere could decrease solar’s carbon footprint and avoid companies accused of using forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In the US the Inflation Reduction Act promises funds for restarting idle polysilicon factories and investing in manufacturing of other solar components. But companies must still turn that momentum into solar panels.

Wacker Chemie’s chemical plant in Charleston Tennessee is large enough to have its own street system. Lettered streets run roughly east to west intersecting numbered avenues at perfect 90° angles.

The 220-hectare site produces polysilicon a key material used to make solar panels and computer chips. Two pipe-covered distillation systems the length of football fields tower over Second Avenue while reactors used to make polysilicon occupy an entire block between C Street and D Street.

Site Leader Ken Collins says Wacker has already invested nearly $3 billion in the plant and the site is still growing. “We’re actively looking at things in F” he says pointing to the location of a future street on the edge of the facility. “And then long term it goes well beyond.”

Wacker is in the midst of spending $200 million to add the production of silicone polymers. Collins says the property is also laid out to allow for polysilicon expansion. Wacker hasn’t announced specific plans for new polysilicon infrastructure but national governments and the solar industry are pushing to increase production in places like Tennessee.

Producers don’t want to rely upon unstable sources. James May CEO REC Silicon

Most of the world’s polysilicon is made in China and the US solar industry is encouraging suppliers to increase production elsewhere. Solar companies argue that a less-concentrated supply chain will be more resilient emit less carbon and circumvent companies accused of using forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The US and Indian governments recently added momentum to this endeavor pledging billions of dollars to scale up domestic solar manufacturing and guarantee future access to clean energy.

Some companies are already responding. Reliance Energy says it will spend $7.5 billion on a green energy manufacturing hub in India that will include polysilicon production. The other two companies that make polysilicon in the US—Hemlock Semiconductor and REC Silicon—are also ramping up production. Hemlock turned on idle capacity for solar-grade polysilicon at its plant in Michigan this summer and REC Silicon plans to reopen a polysilicon facility in Washington. “Producers don’t want to rely upon unstable sources” REC Silicon CEO James May says.

Even with all that momentum challenging China’s preeminence in solar manufacturing will not be easy. In addition to its massive polysilicon capacity Chinese companies control the subsequent steps in the supply chain: the production of silicon ingot and wafers solar cells and final solar panels. Supply chain experts say other countries must build up capacity in those parts of the supply chain as well if they are to decrease the risk of disruptions. And polysilicon makers outside China must prove they can compete with rivals in China that have access to ample government support.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) an industry group argues that incentives in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will kick-start US solar production eventually making it competitive with China. Over the next 8 years SEIA hopes companies will build US factories capable of making 50 GW of solar panels per year nearly enough to power every home in Texas.

“Maybe half of that crosses the finish line” Collins says. “That’s still a lot of polysilicon demand. Much more than the three producers in the US make today.”

The process

Polysilicon is at the heart of a solar panel. Small amounts of other elements are added to polysilicon so that one side of the material has extra electrons. When sunlight hits a solar cell it displaces those extra electrons. They flow to the opposite side of the cell which has molecules that can accept them. The flow of electrons creates an electric current.

The process for making polysilicon starts in mines extracting quartzite which is essentially gravel with high levels of silicon dioxide and low levels of impurities like iron. Many of those mines are in China but quartzite reserves are abundant in Brazil Norway and the US. The gravel is melted down in a furnace with a carbon source usually coal or charcoal to produce silicon metal silvery-gray rocks that are at least 98% silicon.

Companies like Wacker use the Siemens process to remove the remaining impurities. The resulting polysilicon is a crystallized form of silicon that needs to be at least 99.9999% pure for solar applications—and even purer for computer chips. “It’s a really technical plant that turns silver rocks into silver rocks” Collins says of the facility he leads.

In the first step at the Tennessee plant the silicon metal is crushed into a powder and combined with hydrogen chloride at high temperatures to form liquid trichlorosilane. Wacker distills the liquid in spiraling columns several stories tall to increase the purity. “It’s very similar to what you do to a bourbon” Collins says.

The purified trichlorosilane is converted to gas and pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a filament of polysilicon about the diameter of a pencil. Some companies use silane gas instead. Electricity runs through the filament illuminating it like a light bulb and increasing its temperature to 1000 °C. At those high temperatures silicon from the trichlorosilane slowly deposits onto the filament gradually turning it into a thick rod. As a final step the rod is broken into chunks.

MAKING POLYSILICON To create the polysilicon—a crystallized form of nearly pure silicon—needed for solar panels manufacturers begin with quartzite gravel a compound that contains silicon dioxide. The multistep process results in 99.9999% silicon. Step 1: Quartzite gravel containing silicon dioxide is the starting material for polysilicon. Step 2: The quartz is melted down to silicon metal which is at least 98% pure silicon. Step 3: Silicon metal is combined with hydrogen chloride to form liquid trichlorosilane. Step 4: Impurities are removed by distilling the trichlorosilane. Step 5: Trichlorosilane is pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a thin filament of polysilicon. Electricity runs through the filament heating it to 1000 °C. Step 6: The silicon deposits onto the filament turning it into a thick rod that is at least 99.9999% silicon. Step 7: The rods are broken into chunks and sold to companies that make silicon wafers for solar panels.

Some companies such as REC Silicon use a slightly different method called the fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) process. REC Silicon says the FBR process uses less energy. Companies using the Siemens process have to use lots of energy to heat the filament but they also have to use additional energy to cool the walls of the reaction chamber so that silicon doesn’t deposit there.

At the start the FBR process looks similar to the Siemens process with conversion of silicon metal into silane. But then the gas flows through a column seeded with tiny polysilicon beads rather than a chamber with a filament. Silicon deposits on the beads which grow into polysilicon spheres a few millimeters wide.

Beads from the FBR process or chunks from the Siemens process are sold to companies that turn them into cubed ingots which are sawed into paper-thin wafers. The wafers are textured and treated with other elements to turn them into individual solar cells. Multiple cells are soldered and sandwiched between a glass panel and a plastic back sheet to form solar panels.

Outsourcing

It’s a complex process and China dominates nearly every step of it. The country makes more than three-quarters of the world’s polysilicon according to data compiled by polysilicon consultant Johannes Bernreuter. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China also manufactures over 80% of all solar cells and assembled solar panels. The country produces virtually all the wafers used for solar panels.

It wasn’t always this way. In 2010 polysilicon production was split almost evenly among the US Europe South Korea Japan and China. In 2014 the US had nearly a dozen factories producing ingots and wafers according to SEIA data. Today there are none. The IEA estimates that companies in China have invested more than $40 billion in solar manufacturing since 2014 15 times what companies in North America have invested.

Bernreuter says the Chinese government fueled the growth of the country’s solar industry by offering favorable loans affordable land and cheap electricity. “China early on recognized that solar will be a huge market” he says. “They have strategically bet on that industry and supported it.”

US polysilicon producers also suffered a blow in 2014 when China imposed an import tariff cutting off US facilities from some of their most important customers.

Hemlock and Wacker were both building polysilicon plants in Tennessee when the tariffs took hold. Hemlock abandoned its $1 billion project in Clarksville in 2014 as it was on the verge of starting up. Wacker originally intended to focus on the solar market but shifted production to semiconductor-grade silicon when its plant came on line in 2016. In 2019 the tariffs forced REC Silicon to mothball its $1.7 billion polysilicon plant in Moses Lake Washington.

Heymi Bahar an IEA analyst who directed the organization’s report says China’s investment helped decrease the price of solar panels but also concentrated too much production in one place.

The report notes that a single factory in China produces 14% of the world’s polysilicon. In 2020 an explosion at a plant operated by China’s GCL-Tech temporarily halted a tenth of the world’s production capacity according to a report from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “If there is a supply chain disruption the whole world is affected” Bahar says.

Xinjiang

Because China gets much of its electricity from coal-fired power plants making polysilicon and other solar materials outside China would also reduce the industry’s carbon footprint some companies and sustainability researchers argue.

Michael Parr executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance an industry group says the heat used to deposit silicon from trichlorosilane onto the rod requires enormous amounts of power so production is usually located in places where electricity is cheap.

“In China that means western China in Xinjiang . . . and increasingly Inner Mongolia where the grid is almost entirely coal based” Parr says.

He estimates that polysilicon made in China is three times as carbon intensive as polysilicon from other countries largely because of the Chinese electricity grid’s reliance on coal. The IEA reports that even the most carbon-intensive solar panels make up for all their manufacturing-related emissions in less than a year by generating carbon-free electricity but Parr still wants to see production move to places that have access to cleaner electricity grids. He says cheap power from hydroelectricity plants works especially well for polysilicon production.

Dominating solar



REC Silicon’s Washington plant will run on hydropower and the company boasts that the FBR process it uses will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hemlock the largest single energy user in Michigan also says it has access to renewable energy that reduces polysilicon’s carbon footprint.

Reliance on coal-based power isn’t the US solar industry’s only concern with the Xinjiang region. In May of last year Laura Murphy a human rights professor at Sheffield Hallam University coauthored a report accusing four of the largest polysilicon makers in Xinjiang as well as companies that supply them with silicon metal of participating in a forced labor program operated by the Chinese government.

Murphy says the labor program conducted ostensibly to increase economic prosperity in a poor region forces everyone in Xinjiang with Uyghur or Kazakh background to have a job. “That’s the case even if they have to be forcibly placed there by a government agency” she says. “There are government agents who go door to door.”

Murphy says China’s government will separate Uyghur and Kazakh families take away their land and even demolish whole villages essentially forcing them to leave their homes and work in their assigned jobs.

There is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect. Alan Crawford polysilicon consultant

An environmental social and governance report from Daqo New Energy a polysilicon maker with operations in Xinjiang denies that the company uses forced labor and says its suppliers have signed declarations attesting that they don’t use forced labor. A spokesperson for the company declined to answer specific questions. Other major polysilicon makers in Xinjiang—GCL-Tech Xinte Energy and East Hope Group—did not respond to emailed questions.

The evidence of forced labor use was strong enough that earlier this year the US government started enforcing a ban on essentially all products made in Xinjiang. Parr expects the ban to have a big effect. “The game has changed and easy access to Chinese solar is a thing of the past” he says.

Polysilicon consultant Alan Crawford says polysilicon is made in other places in China without forced labor and with a lower carbon footprint. The problem is that ethically produced polysilicon—from other parts of China or other countries—must flow through ingot factories in China where it’s blended with polysilicon from Xinjiang making it almost impossible to say with certainty whether a solar panel was made without forced labor. “There is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect” Crawford says.

Jill Engel-Cox director of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory says companies buying solar panels are starting to pay more attention to such issues. She says there’s an expectation that renewable energy projects will benefit the world broadly—not just its climate.

“We’ve been so focused on economics making them as cheap as possible which is important because they need to be able to compete with other types of energy” she says. “But now how do we consider the social benefit and the environmental benefit?”

REshoring

The US’s ban on solar products from Xinjiang the ongoing trade war between China and the US and the current difficulties of shipping products across the ocean are problems for AES Clean Energy a power company that buys lots of solar panels. President Leonardo Moreno says the supply of panels coming from China has become unreliable. “We have to build hundreds of megawatts of renewables in the US. We want a supply chain that’s stable” he says.

AES is part of a consortium of solar companies trying to incentivize a more resilient supply chain in the US. The consortium is promising to spend more than $6 billion on solar panels as long as suppliers set up US manufacturing operations. “That’s what gives them certainty” Moreno says. “They can build and the demand will be there.”

To encourage production outside China and avoid supply chain risks IEA analyst Bahar says governments also need to offer solar manufacturers support. He says they should use tax policies or incentive schemes to reduce the start-up costs for polysilicon manufacturers and ensure that they have access to cheap electricity just as China has done.

In August US president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. It offers a direct tax credit for the production of solar-grade polysilicon and also offers incentives for other parts of the supply chain like ingot and wafer manufacturing.

In an investor call the day after the signing REC Silicon’s May said the tax credits were a big part of the company’s decision to restart operations at its plant in Washington. The company expects to receive $48 million in credits annually once the facility is operating at full capacity.

The South Korean company Hanwha Solutions which made a major investment in REC Silicon earlier this year is scouting out sites in Texas South Carolina and Georgia for a facility to produce ingots wafers and solar panels according to documents filed with the Texas comptroller’s office. If the project moves forward the company says it would begin operating in 2025. SPI Energy hopes to set up wafer production in the US by 2023 and Convalt Energy hopes to be producing wafers in upstate New York by 2024.

Building wafer manufacturing in the US would have a domino effect Bernreuter says and likely complete a solar supply chain outside China. “If you solve that step of the value chain I think a lot of the other steps could follow relatively easily” he says.

The US could also avoid silicon-based solar panels altogether by using another technology: thin-film cadmium telluride which makes up about 5% of the global solar market. First Solar the largest producer of cadmium telluride panels has operations in the US Malaysia and Vietnam and will soon add a base in India.

The same forces fueling the growth of silicon-based solar manufacturing outside China are also boosting cadmium telluride. The US Department of Energy recently announced $20 million in funding for a consortium to advance the technology and First Solar says it will invest $1.2 billion in US manufacturing now that the Inflation Reduction Act has passed.

They can build and the demand will be there. Leonardo Moreno President AES Clean Energy

Other countries are also hoping to build up their solar industries. In 2021 for example India started offering incentives to help expand its capacity. Shirdi Sai Electricals Reliance Energy and Adani Infrastructure have all committed to building at least 4 GW of manufacturing capacity—from polysilicon to finished panels—before 2024.

“Considering the economies of scale and to be more cost competitive most manufacturers are actually planning for probably 10 GW plus especially for the polysilicon” says Balachander Krishnan who is overseeing the launch of Shirdi Sai Electricals’ planned ingot wafer and module plant.

REC Silicon’s May welcomes the Inflation Reduction Act but he notes that the clock for adding the new capacity started ticking as soon as the tax credit was approved. “It’s designed to promote investment” he says. “The caveat is that it’s got a time limit: 10 years.” After that May says US solar companies will have to be able to compete on their own.

Moreno says the tax credits will give companies the confidence they need to scale up solar manufacturing in the US. That should reduce costs he says. When the countdown hits zero the US will be ready he thinks. “The reason the Chinese panels became very cheap over the years is not technology itself” he says. “It’s the scale.”

At Wacker’s Tennessee plant Collins says the company is focused on the long-term opportunity for polysilicon rather than the Inflation Reduction Act.

The US plant is modeled after Wacker’s flagship industrial park in Burghausen Germany which started operating in 1916 with 450 employees. Today the facility has 10000 employees and an app to help them navigate the sprawling campus.

The company wants to replicate Burghausen in Tennessee. “When the Wacker family . . . came to this site they said this is the Burghausen of the US” Collins says. “That’s their vision.”

Driving around the plant in Tennessee Collins points to all the empty spaces where buildings may rise in the decades to come. Given the pace of solar’s growth it’s a good thing Wacker left some room to build.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYXN0Y29tcGFueS5jb20vOTA3OTA0MTgvcGF0YWdvbmlhLXl2b24tY2hvdWluYXJkLW93bmVyc2hpcC10cnVzdC1ob2xkZmFzdC13b2tlLWNhcGl0YWxpc20tY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYW1lcmljYW4tYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Patagonia's ownership bombshell changes the game for American business,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fastcompany.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /90790418/patagonia-yvon-chouinard-ownership-trust-holdfast-woke-capitalism-climate-change-american-business (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950D29CC0>, 'Connection to www.fastcompany.com timed out.

In March it took 12 days to receive my Walmart+ credit but I received the credit on the very same day in June. AMERICANEXPRESS.COM

Once you are speaking to a customer service representative mention that you have missing statement credits and identify exactly which benefit they are related to. From here mention the date of the charge for which you didn't receive the appropriate credits.

In both July and August I didn't receive statement credits for my Walmart+ membership which is a benefit of The Platinum Card® from American Express. This was apparently a wider issue as reported by Doctor of Credit. However the chat representative said billing should be fixed from September 2022. My chat session to resolve the missing credits took less than five minutes from start to end. Enrollment required.

If you decide to call the conversation model will be the same. Explain which credits are missing and the date of the relevant charge then request the credit from the employee you are talking to.

Most likely one of two things will happen during your conversation. It's possible the customer service agent will tell you to wait longer before they can manually post the credit for you. If that happens ask how much longer you should wait for the statement credit to post to your account before you contact Amex again for further help.

It's also possible that the representative will post courtesy credits to your account while talking to you. If that happens ask how long you should wait for these to show up.

In either situation make sure you take note of this timeline and ask what you should do next if things don't go as planned. I usually ask ""If the credits don't show up by then what should I do?""

Bottom line

When technology works as expected life is great. You enroll for a benefit offered by your credit card make the corresponding purchase and then a statement credit posts to your bill a few days later.

Unfortunately it doesn't always work this way. The good news here is that claiming your missing statement credits from Amex isn't overly difficult. The most time-efficient way to get your missing statement credits is to use Amex's online chat function.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2VvcmdlY2FsaG91bi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3RoZS1iaWdnZXN0LWNyeXB0by1mYW50YXN5LW9mLWFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Biggest Crypto Fantasy Of All,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2VvcmdlY2FsaG91bi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3RoZS1iaWdnZXN0LWNyeXB0by1mYW50YXN5LW9mLWFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950C60DF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Led by Chef d’Equipe Bobby Costello the team stayed composed and focused as the technical track designed by Uliano Vezzani (ITA) proved challenging with rails coming down throughout the course. The final phase was incredibly influential changing the team standings multiple times as the top 25 combinations concluded the end of the day making for an exciting championship finale. All five U.S. combinations finished yesterday’s phase in the top 25 and jumped in the second session of competition on the grass field at Centro Equestre Federale. Of the team’s performance Costello elaborated on the work and commitment from the athletes their staff the owners and all the support team to produce a historic result for the U.S.



“It was just such a crazy day. I had a feeling when I walked the course that it was going to be very influential. I’d never seen such a consistently big and very technical track and have those three lines all single jumps to combinations with three completely different distances. It was a real important phase and no team went unscathed and you had to keep fighting to the end” said Costello.



“I hope this means great things for the future. I feel the program has been on the slow burn of the swing for a couple of years and I think there was still something missing. My number one priority when I took this interim position was to try and change the culture and really make sure that everyone had each other’s backs and building trust among the riders” he added. “The riders the owners the staff people have never given up on the sport and I’m so happy for everyone even those at home who get to watch and get to be proud so really good just all around for us.”



Will Coleman and Off The Record produced the only clear round for the team managing the questions asked throughout the difficult track with poise demonstrating the scopiness rideability and talent of the 2009 Irish Sport Horse gelding owned by The Off The Record Syndicate. The pair finished as the highest placed U.S. combination taking seventh place overall on a score of 27.2. Coleman purchased the gelding as a four-year-old and has developed him throughout his career noting that the progress and accomplishments of their partnership is something he continues to cherish.



“It was great. I’m so thrilled. It was par for the course for this entire week for us to be honest. I feel like he’s punched above his weight in every phase and I’m just so happy with him” said Coleman. “I’m so proud of my horse and my team and everyone involved with this program. I’ve had him since he was four and produced him myself and it’s cool to see him go in there and rise to the moment.”



Lauren Nicholson and Vermiculus were the trailblazers for the team and finishing in 19th place overall on a final individual score of 41.1. The pair had two down and finished slightly over the optimum time to add 8.4 to their score following their sharp cross-country round yesterday.



“He tried his heart out for me out there. We had the two down that have caused loads of people problems at the end of the course but he’s come out of this week feeling good. This was a really tough track. It’s super technical and a real show jumping track. He jumped well and feels great so I’m really happy with him overall.”



In a notoriously challenging phase for Boyd Martin and Tsetserleg TSF a 2007 Trakehner gelding owned by Christine Turner Tommie Turner and Thomas Turner the pair dropped four rails for a total of 16 faults for a final score of 41.2 to finish in 20th place overall. Of the team camaraderie Martin spoke of the drought the U.S. program has had since their last team podium at a world championship and how much energy and excitement he can feel as the program looks ahead to the future.



“I’m very proud to be an American today. Having five clear rounds yesterday in the cross-country was awesome and just looking at the results here any three of the five of us could have gotten a team medal” said Martin. “I’ve been on many of these teams and we’ve been so close over and over again and it’s a massive sigh of relief. I’m really thankful for this team and proud to be here with these guys sitting next to me.”



As the last combination to contest the course Tamie Smith and Mai Baum a 2006 German Sport Horse gelding owned by Alex Ahearn Ellen Ahearn and Eric Markell added eight faults to their original score of 24.0 to finish on a 32.0 to take ninth place individually. Smith while disappointed to be out of the individual medal running after her round said the focus was always on the team result and their overall performance throughout the week meant more than an individual medal.



“We came here to do our best and I have to say we all knew that potentially we could medal and I think we’re pleasantly surprised and we’re less than a point away from third and it shows to the quality of the field and the riding. It’s impressive and I’m just so honored to be here” said Smith. “I’m very proud of my horse. I feel like it just wasn’t meant to be and that’s okay. We’re here and we got the silver medal and that’s what we came here for. I have to push that to the side that this isn’t about my individual performance it’s about the team performance and I’m ecstatic with our result.”



Ariel Grald (Southern Pines N.C) noted yesterday that her goal was to finish the championship on her dressage score of 32.5 which is exactly what she did. Aboard Leamore Master Plan a 2009 Irish Sport Horse gelding owned by Annie Eldridge Grald guided the stunning gelding to a masterful clear round inside of the time. In her first championship appearance for the stars and stripes Grald felt that it was her moment to prove that she deserved to be on the world stage while also taking in every piece of knowledge and learning she could to help continue to prepare her for the future.



“I was a bit nervous going in and he’s such a great show jumper. I just have to trust him and trust that he’s going to go in and try and I knew after the first fence that he was good. The combinations can be hard for him because he has such a huge step but all credit to my horse. I really have to mess up as a jockey for him to not jump clear so it’s a lot of pressure of me to give him a good ride. He’s absolutely brilliant. I wanted to finish on my dressage score and we did so I couldn’t be happier for him and that’s all you can ask for.”

The U.S. Commerce Department is investigating the potential data collection and transmission capabilities of equipment from Chinese tech company Huawei that was installed on cell towers near U.S. military installations including missile silos in western Nebraska as Reuters reported.

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood R-Neb. wrote to the Commerce Department this week seeking an update on the investigation which he said he supports. He sought confirmation from Commerce about any Huawei tech on cell towers within 20 miles of Offutt or other Nebraska military facilities.

Huawei equipment has been found that close to Offutt and to nuclear missile silos in Cheyenne County home to Sidney several sources told the Nebraska Examiner. State and federal leaders have not yet discussed specifics publicly.

“I think it’s a slap in the face to every airman that goes to work” said Flood whose 1st Congressional District includes Offutt. “I want to know where this is in Nebraska what companies are using it and why it hasn’t been removed.”

Adm. Charles Richard commander of Offutt’s U.S. Strategic Command acknowledged during a conference in July the reality of nation-states trying to access military information. He said U.S. intelligence services and others are working to protect key military assets from cyberattack.

Huawei was founded by former members of the Chinese military. The company has denied that its equipment is a spying threat or that it is working in concert with the Chinese government. Tech experts say the Chinese state can force companies in China to share users’ information.

Crystal Rhoades a Democrat who represents much of the Omaha area on Nebraska’s Public Service Commission would not discuss the locations of specific cell phone towers in Nebraska with Chinese equipment on them citing national security concerns.

But she said nearly every Viaero Wireless tower in Nebraska has Huawei equipment on it. She said the company has discussed applying for up to $330 million in federal funds to rip out and replace Chinese equipment in Nebraska with tech approved by the U.S. Department of Defense. The company did not return repeated messages seeking comment.

“This is a big deal” Rhoades said. “It needs to get fixed.”

Flood said he hopes the Commerce Department acts with a sense of urgency. He said the United Kingdom banned the use of Huawei equipment on its cell towers and the U.S. should be able to act with similar speed. He said the public needs answers and soon.

“China is a real threat” Flood said. “We can’t trust Chinese technology when it comes to protecting our national security. … My hope is this should not be drawn out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9hb2EuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamVob3ZhaHMtd2l0bmVzc2VzLWJhY2staW4tZmllbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jehovah's Witnesses back in field,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9hb2EuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamVob3ZhaHMtd2l0bmVzc2VzLWJhY2staW4tZmllbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951230670>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Once Revealed How Going to Prison Cost Him Movie Roles,"T.I. was once in consideration for several potentially big movies that starred huge actors but prison time got in the way of his acting career.

Rapper T.I. once set out to make a presence in the world of Hollywood after already making an impact in the music industry. But going to jail once played a role in impeding the star’s acting career.

T.I. missed out on ‘Tower Heist’ because of his prison sentence

T.I. | Prince Williams/Wireimage

Superstar T.I. was in the middle of a rising film career before his stint in prison. He was already making a name for himself in Hollywood having starred in features like American Gangster and Takers. But his prison sentence in 2010 cost him a couple of roles that might have further benefited his acting prospects.

One of those films was the heist movie Tower Heist which ended up starring Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller. In an interview with Daily Beast the multi-platinum artist shared he was also supposed to be a part of the comedic roster.

“Actually man I was supposed to be in Tower Heist. I was ‘indisposed.’ Me and Brian Grazer who produced American Gangster were speaking about it when it was just a script and Brett [Ratner] hadn’t even came on to direct it yet so it was years ago” T.I. said.

By the time the project was on the way to becoming an actual film T.I was serving his time.

“After that it went away then came back with Brett attached to it and Ben Stiller and I was reconsidered and Brett and I had some very very positive discussions about it and I was right there. And then life happened. But I still believe it’s going to be a good movie” he said.

Other roles rapper T.I. missed out on

Tower Heist wasn’t the only movie that prison time cost the rapper. There were other blockbusters that T.I. was being discussed for and many major actors he missed out on working with.

“G.I. Joe II [G.I. Joe: Retaliation] they called me for that. World War Z with Brad Pitt. They called me for that. The Joel Silver movie [Bullet to the Head] – I would have been co-starring with Sylvester Stallone. They called me for that too” T.I. once told Sister 2 Sister (via Contact Music).

However T.I. still managed to bounce back with his acting career. After being released from prison the rapper beefed up his film resume by starring in films like Get Hard and Ant-Man. The last feature film the rapper starred in was 2020’s Monster Hunter.

Why T.I. was once sentenced to 11 months in prison

In September 2010 T.I. was once reportedly stopped in Los Angeles by police for a traffic violation. The officers involved in the case found drugs in the rapper’s car leading to his arrest and subsequent imprisonment. Prosecutors were looking to sentence T.I. to two years for the crime. But T.I. managed to get a more lenient sentence of 11 months.

The hip-hop mogul vowed to change his ways after the arrest citing drug addiction as a major reason for his behavior.

“As I discovered in talking to my probation officer I had many problems from my childhood. Now I am down to the disease of addiction. I need help for me my mother my kids. I need the court to give me mercy. Judge don’t send me back to prison” T.I. once told the judge during his sentencing according to CNN.",,,

The patents surrounding Soliris (eculizumab) extend its period of market exclusivity from 2022 to 2027 but Alexion thinks it has found a chink in the legal armour.

Soliris is still the mainstay of Alexion’s business and accounted for around four-fifths of the company’s revenue in the last quarter.

With sales of almost $1 billion each quarter Alexion would be in deep water without Soliris which is approved in several rare diseases but is also very expensive at almost $500000 per year in the US.

That’s why the protection is so important to Alexion which is hoping to move rare disease patients on to a longer-lasting version of the drug before it loses its exclusivity.

But Amgen’s move could make this far more difficult should it get a biosimilar approved in time to treat rare diseases related to the complement system such as generalised myasthenia gravis paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome.

The US patent office has said it will review patents on Soliris after Amgen challenged them according to court filings that surfaced on Friday.

The challenge relates to patents covering the composition of the active ingredient eculizumab its formulation and use to treat proxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria

Alexion’s shares were down more than 10% after the market learned about news of the decision while Amgen’s shares ticked up.

The decision came from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board the patent office’s administrative court which said it was beginning an inter partes review of the patents.

The board’s decision means that it thinks there is a good chance that the challenge may succeed and decisions are made within a year with the possibility of a six-month extension.

Infamous for its litigious behaviour in the pharma industry Amgen lost the latest round in a legal battle with Sanofi over patents over cholesterol drug patents.

In the ruling a district court judge said aside a jury decision from February and said some of Amgen’s patent claims to protect its PCSK9 drug Repatha were invalid because they did not sufficiently outline the company’s claimed innovations.

Amgen said it would appeal against the decision in the long-running feud between the two companies with competing drugs from the same class which were approved within a few weeks of each other in 2016.

Aside from the patent challenges the California-based pharma’s legal department has been typically busy this year – in April Amgen became embroiled in a row with Novartis after trying to kick the Swiss pharma out of a development partnership over the migraine drug Aimovig.

Amgen is reportedly unhappy that Novartis’ subsidiary Sandoz is supplying materials to Alder Biopharmaceuticals which is developing a rival calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) class migraine drug.

Novartis has stated that the agreement with Alder is being terminated and the contract manufacturing agreement will only continue until the end of 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Marshmello has become one of the world's most recognizable electronic music producers and DJs. However his fame has been associated with the mask not the face behind it. The masked DJ prefers to perform with it no matter what.

When Marshmello first came into the music scene everyone wanted to know who he was and fans became detectives to reveal his true identity.

While he manages to protect his privacy personal space and even the mystery of his looks under the mask people now know who he is as Forbes conducted their investigation and delivered proof.

It Is Already Known Who Is behind the Mask of DJ Marshmello

DJ Marshmello began his career in 2015 by creating remixes of other musicians. His work attracted fans and he began to receive support from musicians DJs and music producers like Skrillex that same year.

During that period his friend unknowingly revealed his real identity. While in an interview with journalist producer presenter and author Katie Couric Skrillex's phone rang.

At the time Couric was looking into his phone and she informed him that Chris was calling. When she said Chris Skrillex said it was Marshmello and told Couric that Marshmello was an upcoming and skilled talent.

As DJ Marshmello was not famous then no one gave the interview another thought until some time later when committed fans wanted to know the man behind the mask.

In November 2017 Forbes decided to unmask the masked DJ and did their investigations. They tracked him through the music rights management site BMI where they discovered that he had registered as a songwriter and performer.

The site excellent for linking pseudonyms with real names showed that Marshmello was linked to Christopher Comstock. Forbes contacted Marshmello's management and what happened next proved they were on the right track.

Less than 24 hours after reaching out to his management with links from the website the data on DJ Marshmello got wiped off the site. They and his lawyer also refused to comment on his identity.

Fans who were also digging into revealing his identity discovered that Skrillex had posted a video in 2016 celebrating the DJ's birthday on the same day as Comstock's birthday.

Shortly after Forbes' initial investigation while they began the vetting process for their ""30 Under 30"" they confirmed that they were right about his identity from their previous investigation.

DJ Marshmello Doesn't Want to Show His Face

Despite their confirmation the DJ has never acknowledged any information on the internet about his true identity. In 2017 he revealed why he prefers to remain under his mask. He tweeted:

""I don't take my helmet off because I don't want or need fame. I'm genuinely trying to create something positive for people to connect with.""

In another tweet he stated ""The helmet makes me Marshmello and also makes you Marshmello...we are all Marshmello."" Marshmello was a name the DJ had picked based on his music's mellow feel.

Marshmello's manager Moe Shalizi also said their concept for the DJ was to create a universal character. He said:

""For us it was how do you create a brand that is accessible to everybody that everyone can be and relate to?""

And He Jokes about Fans' Attempts to Unmask Him

DJ Marshmello has a great sense of humor despite everyone wanting to know everything about his personality. In 2018 he trolled his Canadian fans with a false identity reveal at the iHeartRadio MMVAs.

After the hosts called out his name as the winner of the Best EDM/Dance Artist or Group the hitmaker got on stage to receive his award. He proceeded to unmask himself as fans screamed but instead Shawn Mendes was the one under his mask.

In May 2022 the DJ also sent fans into a frenzy when he liked a fan's tweet of Comstock whom she called Marshmello. The tweet and his reaction quickly went viral with fans calling it a confirmation of his identity.",,,,,,,,,

Apple is releasing three new watch models (Apple Watch SE Series 8 and Ultra) two iPhone models (the 14 and 14 Pro each in two sizes) and the second-generation AirPods Pro. As a Bloomberg Pursuits journalist who focuses on lifestyle products I'm going to home in on those packed with the most features and therefore the priciest ones—the Apple Watch Ultra (from $799) and iPhone 14 Pro (from $999).

Apple Watch Ultra

With a 49mm titanium case and a rugged appearance the Apple Watch Ultra is not your ordinary smartwatch. Yes it has all the features other Apple Watches have but it's able to handle extreme outdoor conditions.

The customizable “action button” available only on the Apple Watch Ultra is on the left side of the device and coated in a color called “international orange.” It's a new hardware addition to make the watch easier to navigate. By pressing the physical button you can track workout intervals start up a built-in diving computer (the Oceanic app by Huish Outdoors LLC available this fall which automatically launches after you submerge and calculates and monitors dive parameters) set up a stopwatch or drop waypoints—geographical pinpoints—along your route.

Coupled with dual-frequency GPS the waypoints feature allows anyone from hikers to people living in dense urban areas to accurately document the locations they've been to and retrace the route they took in case they get lost. Although I didn't go into the woods to test the GPS system the working of the function felt intuitive. One push on the action button will drop a pin on the location you're at and a simple scroll of the crown on the watch's right side can take you to the previous point you dropped. Selecting the “Backtrack” function within the Action Button app will map the route you've taken.

The regular Apple Watch Series 8 also has the upgraded compass that allows waypoint dropping and backtracking but it requires more manual maneuvering without the action button—which is probably fine for many folks who don't worry about getting lost in the wilderness on a regular basis.

In a noisy environment—say because of the harsh wind on a mountaintop or the hustle and bustle of a big city—the Apple Watch Ultra has an upgraded microphone system to pick up your voice for clear phone calls as well as a new speaker that can blast a loud emergency siren that Apple says can be heard up to 600 feet or 180 meters away. (The demonstrator at the presentation said it was too loud to test there.) Another lifesaving function also available for the Series 8 is a new sensor to detect a car crash and notify emergency services.

Along with older features for tracking sleep ECG heart rate and blood oxygen both watch models added two sensors one on the back of the device and the other inside and behind the display to discern changes in body temperature. Apple pitches the feature as a family planning tool: By wearing the watch all the time women can track their ovulation cycles (after it analyzes at least two months of temperature readings) and decide on the best time to get pregnant. The idea seemed cool but I have reservations about wearing a chunky device on my wrist to bed. And to voluntarily relinquish so much data and control to a piece of technology gave me a bit of Black Mirror flashbacks.

The Apple Watch Ultra priced at $799 can also sustain 36 hours of battery life or 60 hours on a low power setting endure temperatures from -4F to 131F and remain water-resistant to a depth of 100 meters.

iPhone 14 Lineups

As mentioned Apple is prioritizing the “lifesaving” aspect of many of the new features. All the iPhone 14s are capable of sending an emergency SOS via satellite (the service will be available in November). That means even without Wi-Fi or cellular data the phones can make emergency calls using satellite technology. They also have a crash detection sensor that will alert emergency services if you're in an accident.

Other than the lifesaving functions there are cool features like setting up multiple lock screens taking better photos in low light and more stabilized action videos. I tested the autofocus front camera while uncomfortably taking a selfie under the gaze of a model dressed in all kinds of shades of green who eventually joined me in a photo and exclaimed “Look it can focus on both of us. ” It did. In a dim-lit room I captured another model's bored face with cameras on both an iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro. The trio of cameras balanced the dark purple and brown colors while showing the person clearly.

The iPhone 14 (from $799) and iPhone 14 Plus (from $899) seem like a standard upgrade from the iPhone 13—including better 12-megapixel wide cameras and different colors (midnight blue starlight purple and (PRODUCT)RED). Apple offers a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen respectively for the two identical designs and eliminated the Mini option.

In comparison the most exciting features are packed in the pricier iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Available in a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen the two cost at least $999 and $1099 respectively. A notable addition is the pill-shaped black area at the top of the screen where the speaker and front camera are located. Apple calls it the Dynamic Island. It's a multitasking tool that helps people track what they're doing. Say if you're listening to music and need to switch to another app the music app will be automatically shifted up to the island. You can later expand the island to change songs or pause the music. You can also glance at it for a phone call's duration and an animated waveform of the audio; a voice memo's recording; a timer's progress; or see a combination of apps working in the background.

The camera system is a big deal for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max which each have three cameras in the back. The main wide camera is 48 megapixels a monumental boost from 12 megapixels for the iPhone 13 Pro.

The Always-On display for the new models dims the screen instead of completely turning it off so users can see essential information such as the time date and temperature without tapping the screen—the essentials are customizable and you can turn off the Always-On display too.

And the Fitness app that used to appear on your iPhone only after pairing with an Apple Watch? It'll show up on your home screen once you upgrade to iOS 16 even if you don't own an Apple Watch. The Fitness tab within the app (coming this fall) is filled with workouts meditations and motivational episodes. New Apple Watch buyers get Apple Fitness for free for three months (existing owners get one month free) then the subscription is $9.99 a month or $79.99 annually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3RyYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L2FwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXVsdHJhLWdpdmVhd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Apple Watch Giveaway - Win a Free Apple Watch Ultra,"This competition has ended and we have a new Apple Watch Giveaway for 2024 here.

The iPhone 14 line-up reserves the best features for the high-end Pro models costing at least USD1000. And based on preorder data the strategy is already working with consumers who have turned the most expensive new iPhone into the most popular version.

Though overall spending on mobile devices and computers is slowing this year there’s still an appetite for top-tier smartphones – Apple’s strength. That’s allowed the company to hold production steady at a time when much of the industry is scaling back plans.

“The data continues to point to robust demand for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max which could have a materially positive impact for both mix and margins” an analyst at Evercore ISI Amit Daryanani said in a report this week.

The iPhone 14 line was unveiled earlier this month alongside new Apple Watches and AirPods. The company didn’t raise prices in the United States (US) a surprise to analysts who thought inflationary pressure would force the move. But Apple is still attempting to upsell consumers more than ever before.

The standard iPhone which starts at USD799 doesn’t even run Apple’s latest processor the A16. Instead it uses the same A15 chip as last year with the A16 going into the Pro models.

The Pro phones also get significant camera improvements and a new interface called the Dynamic Island. That’s left users with less reason to upgrade to a basic iPhone 14 but plenty of incentive to pay a little more for the Pro. A flurry of carrier promotions and trade-in offers also may coax US consumers into buying a glitzier model.

Apple reshuffled its display configurations this year as well. Gone is the mini version of the iPhone. Instead the company is betting that consumers want more screen real estate.

The non-Pro iPhone 14 will come in a 6.1-inch model and a 6.7-inch Plus version that won’t be available until October 7. The preorder data suggests the iPhone 14 Pro Max is more in demand than the same model was last year part of the shift upscale according to a report by KGI Securities.

The question now is whether that momentum is strong enough for Apple to overcome a broader slump. Worldwide the smartphone market is expected to decline 3.5 per cent to 1.31 billion units this year according to market research firm IDC.

In China both a manufacturing hub for Apple and a key market smartphone sales have tumbled this year. But Apple shipments are up five per cent compared with an overall decline of 23 per cent according to Evercore ISI’s Daryanani. “Apple continues to gain significant share in China and we expect the share gains to continue” he said.

A successful iPhone 14 launch could help ease investor jitters after a roller coaster of a month. The stock has whipsawed between gains and losses in recent trading sessions with the shares suffering their worst single-day rout since 2020 on Tuesday."

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year — her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website — the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page — so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being naïve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

Through the agreement the companies will work with corn farmers in Iowa to implement sustainable farming practices for the production of Spiber’s biomaterials.

Made from corn-based dextrose Brewed Protein is a next-generation polymer that replaces petroleum-derived materials in a variety of applications ranging from clothing to car seats. ADM and Spiber first partnered in 2020 to build a manufacturing facility in Clinton IA to convert corn dextrose into Brewed Protein using ADM’s massive microbial fermentation capabilities.

Now both companies are working to expand the environmental impact of Brewed Protein by encouraging Iowa farmers to adopt regenerative farming practices such as the use of cover crops the reduction of tillage and improvement of nutrient management.

Better soil

Many positive benefits are associated with regenerative practices including enriched soil health reduced soil erosion and increased farm profitability. Sustainable practices can also improve the ability of soil to sequester carbon which can result in lowered greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Through the ADM-Spiber project farmers will receive financial compensation and technical support to implement the on-farm changes. The project’s impacts will also be monitored using Field to Market’s methodologies and will be ISCC certified for GHG emissions.

Animal-free fibers

Based in Japan Spiber uses precision fermentation to create polymers that can be used to make animal-free spider silk wool leather fur and more. As of 2021 the company had raised an incredible $565M for US expansion including a mass production facility in Iowa.

“Sustainability is powering ADM’s growth strategy and more importantly it represents who we are as a company” said Paul Scheetz ADM’s director of Climate Smart Ag Origination. “As evidenced by our Scope 3 commitments we’re committed to leading in the decarbonization of our entire value chain and regenerative agriculture is a key element of that strategy.”

Improved supply chain

“Through our in-house life cycle assessment we know that our primary feedstock source is one of the biggest drivers of Brewed Protein polymer’s environmental impact” said Sunita Darbe VP of Sustainability at Spiber America.”Thanks to ADM’s experience with regenerative agriculture programs in Iowa we are able to incorporate these practices into our supply chain from the beginning of Brewed Protein polymer production in the US. We appreciate their support in making this project possible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

“It’s a difficult day for every bereaved family it’s a difficult day for every citizen it’s a difficult day for every Shin Bet employee it’s also a difficult day for me personally” Bar says.

Ten members and veterans of the Shin Bet were killed since last Memorial Day all in the October 7 attack.

Bar says the Shin Bet failed to provide its vaunted security umbrella for the nation on October 7.

“We all feel the loss the feeling that we could have prevented it and as the head of the agency and responsible for the agency’s activities I feel it perhaps more than anyone” Bar continues.

He says the Shin Bet is undertaking an “in-depth” investigation of its role in the October 7 failures.

“A painful and significant investigation. We will learn from this and correct what is required. This is our duty to the people of Israel and this is our duty to the fallen. Without the public’s trust in the state institutions and us we have no right to exist” Bar says.

Bar says that the agency’s role in the war “is not over yet.”

“We will not rest until we return all 128 hostages home and the four who were there before. Those who are alive and those who are not. All of them. Because this is the real difference between us and them: We will sacrifice our lives for the citizens they will sacrifice the lives of citizens for themselves” he adds."

Christy Reeves executive director for Lubbock Habitat for Humanity said local volunteers along with 68 national volunteers from Blitz Home Builders and numerous donors including Atmos Energy made this year’s build a success.

“I don't know how we ever did this without Atmos Energy” Reeves said. “But these are going to be the first zero-net-energy houses ever built in Lubbock Texas. It's incredible.”

Becky Palmer president of the West Texas Division for Atmos Energy said these zero-net-energy homes are designed to produce as much energy as they consume during the year.

Habitat for Humanity builds three homes in 12 days

This is achieved through installing solar panels on the roofs of the homes along with using windows that are Energy Star rated efficient spray insulation and efficient natural gas appliances.

“This balanced energy approach with natural gas really creates this reliable and sustainable home that will fuel the family's safe and driving future” Palmer said.

When creating the homes for families Palmer said it was important to remember affordable house need affordable energy costs to go with them.

This year's build was also a special operation for Habitat for Humanity because it was dedicated to one of their founding board members who died recently.

Former Director Larry Landusky presented Joy Vann with a commemorative hammer in honor of her husband and founding board member William “Penny” Pennington Vann.

“He was so humble that he refused to let (the) Habitat board name an award in his honor” Landusky said. “So that's the reason why it's a special privilege — special day today — that this will forever be known as the 2022 William Pennington Vann Blitz Build.”

Habitat also received its largest personal gift from veteran Cheryl Boyd Madison which will go toward Habitat’s first Veteran’s Day Blitz Build to build a home for a veteran.

Reeves said the event will be a one-week build starting on Nov. 5 and ending on Veterans Day with a red white and blue celebration.

“We want everyone in Lubbock to help veterans because our vision for Habitat is everyone in the world deserves a decent place to live and above all people who served our country do” Reeves said. “We're going to start making that happen in Lubbock.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The county board of elections rebuffed the attempts by Recorder Becky Lynch and Clerk of Courts Faith Andrews because state and federal laws tightly restrict who can access information about the machines which if disseminated could pose a security risk for safe elections.

Lynch in an email to cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer however claims she found the manuals online and sent them to members of the county’s automatic data processing board. She said Andrews sought the information at a time when the board of elections began the process of buying new voting machines.

“That sparked the requests for more information and the manuals to the machine all among the many headlines of voter fraud at the time” Lynch’s email said.

The requests happened at a time when Republicans at local levels across the country began pushing for information on voting machines to try and find proof that fraud contributed to former President Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 presidential election in what has become known as the “Stop the Steal” movement.

Dozens of court challenges and investigations turned up no evidence of any widespread fraud in the election. Criminal investigations into data breaches and attempted data breaches in other parts of the country have been launched and appear similar to the one in Lake County.

Lynch in a follow-up email to a reporter forwarded the manuals and said she later found them by conducting an internet search using the voting machine model numbers.

Lake County Board of Elections Director Ross McDonald had said he and the board of elections attorneys determined that Andrews and Lynch should not have received the manuals and denied their requests.

“What really mattered to us is that this is a very sensitive document and it’s a security record which is exempt from public records laws in Ohio” McDonald said. “There’s a lot of potential to give people insight into administrator-level information that only election officials should know.”

McDonald said there are several levels of elections security that likely would thwart a potential attempt at hacking. Still he said “It’s a risk that shouldn’t be there.”

Andrews did not return multiple messages seeking comment.

On May 4 2021 the day of a special election someone using Lake County Commissioner John Hamercheck’s security card swiped into the building logged onto the county’s server with a non-county laptop in Hamercheck’s office and recorded county computer data officials previously said. The attempted hack never reached the board of elections servers and only amounted to showing wireless printers linking up with each other officials previously said.

Screenshots of what was accessed ended up displayed at a cyber symposium that MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell a Trump supporter had promised would demonstrate election fraud.

Lindell posted a video message on social media Wednesday that said the FBI seized his phone and asked him questions about an elections data breach scheme in Mesa County Colorado in which authorities have charged local elections clerk Tina Peters and a deputy clerk with breaching the county’s voting system technology.

The information stolen from Mesa County — a hard drive copy of proprietary software developed by Dominion Voting Systems that is used across the country — ended up featured in Lindell’s symposium alongside the benign information taken from the Lake County commissioner’s office.

Both Peters and Hamercheck had spoken with Lindell associate Doug Frank a former Cincinnati-area teacher who worked with local officials across the country prior to the symposium according to The Washington Post. Frank on Wednesday wrote on Telegram that the FBI also seized his phone.

Hamercheck previously denied any involvement in the incident. A spokeswoman for the Lake County commissioners referred a reporter to county prosecutors. Assistant Lake County Prosecutor David Hackman declined comment.

Ohio Attorney General spokesman Steve Irwin said the investigation remains on-going as did Ohio Secretary of State spokesman Rob Nichols. An FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson confirmed the existence of the investigation to The Washington Post in August 2021. When asked about the status of the case this week the agency’s new spokeswoman Susan Licate said she couldn’t confirm or deny the investigation existed.

Elections officials have said attempts to gain access to voting machine information could undermine the confidence in secure elections and in cases across the country where information has been turned over could render voting machines and tabulators vulnerable to hackers.

McDonald Lake County’s director of its board of elections said he has never had requests for voting manuals in the last seven years. He said he doesn’t believe Lynch or Andrews did anything nefarious though they may have been motivated by rampant unsubstantiated rumors of fraud that permeated the country since the 2020 presidential election he said.

“I think they just wanted the manuals because there was a lot of talk in circles regarding the 2020 election that they believe that there was a lot of fraud that occurred” McDonald said.

Lynch has posted on social media about 2020 election fraud and re-posted statements from Trump about how the election was stolen.

In April 2021 shortly before the breach Lynch asked the board of elections for the manuals for the county’s voting machines and tabulators both for the machines they used at the time and the new ones the county was considering buying. It eventually bought the machines. McDonald said he denied the request and never heard back from Lynch.

Lynch a member of the county’s data board later tried to route the purchase of the machines through the data board. McDonald said that was improper and Lynch’s request was denied.

The day after the attempted breach Andrews emailed McDonald and said she had previously asked for the manuals for machines being used at the time and during the 2020 presidential election along with the manuals for the new machines.

“Still don’t have those” Andrews wrote. “I need to see copies as soon as possible please.”

McDonald sent her the poll workers’ manual the same day and sought an opinion from Lake County prosecutors on the machines’ manuals. Andrews immediately responded saying: “I don’t see any indication on this manual anywhere that it was produced by the manufacturer of the machine… ES&S. I need the manual produced by ES&S for their machine…operations manual and those that would contain specifications for the voting machine itself as well as the tabulator.”

She followed up five days later after hearing that McDonald asked the prosecutor’s office for legal advice.

“You had to ascertain whether another elected official for the County of Lake an officer of the Court could view the manuals for the existing voting machines. Wowser…that’s intense” she wrote.

The Avery Dennison plant at 870 W. Anderson Blvd. is slated for an addition to its northwest side. George Boyd engineering manager for the site said it will consist of about 62000 square feet of warehouse and shipping space as well as 10 shipping docks.

“The purpose of this expansion is to extend our existing shipping area” Boyd told the Daily Reporter in an email. “More specifically we are currently limited in output due to space constraints in our shipping area.”

Work is expected to begin this October and finish around October 2023 he continued.

Boyd said at a Greenfield Plan Commission meeting earlier this month that the expansion won’t drive a higher employee headcount. The plant currently has about 470 employees he added but its target number is around 500.

The plan commission approved a development plan for the project.

It comes after an expansion that finished in 2020 that doubled the plant’s size to nearly 600000 square feet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQ5ZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtZGF5LWluLXRoZS1iYXktc3RldmUteW91bmctbGVhZHMtNDllcnMtdG8tdmljdG9yeS1vdmVyLXRoZS1yYW1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Day in The Bay: Steve Young Leads 49ers to Victory Over the Rams,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQ5ZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtZGF5LWluLXRoZS1iYXktNDllcnMtZmlyc3QtZXZlci1uZmwtdG91Y2hkb3du0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Day in The Bay: 49ers First-Ever NFL Touchdown,,,,,,,

September 16: ""Runathon of Hope"" is an annual running event well organised and run with efficacious precision by the Rotary Club of Nigdi.

Runathon started in 2010 and continues to attract hordes of enthusiastic runners and corporate participants. Throughout the years 56000 runners of all abilities have participated in this event organised by PCMC.

The film which serves as a metaphor for climate change depicts Chinese scientists leading the nations of the world—with the notable absence of the U.S.—in order to save the planet. The film takes the virtues of collectivism as self-evident and is sharply critical of selfishness.

We can also learn from the disappointment of celebrated Asian-American films such as Crazy Rich Asians ($175MM in the U.S. $1.7MM in China) and The Farewell ($18MM and less than $1MM). Both movies were ostensibly about China but placed Americans with Chinese ancestry at the center of the narrative. Even the director of The Farewell Lulu Wang who was born in Beijing but raised in Miami foresaw the muted response in China having previously told Variety “I do think this film is a little bit more Chinese than Crazy Rich Asians but it’s still told through the perspective of an American woman.”

The decline of Disney Hollywood’s leading studio in China is already reflected in much of the history listed above. But it’s important to stress that in the mid-2010s it truly appeared that the House of Mouse had cracked the Chinese market. It’s striking from the vantage point of 2022 that Bob Iger made Disney’s Chinese foray the centerpiece of his 2019 memoir The Ride of a Lifetime. Consider that as part of the launch of Star Wars: The Force Awakens Disney was allowed to adorn the Great Wall of China with the franchise’s familiar Storm Troopers. (Imagine the difficulty involved for an American corporation to stage a promotional event in communist China using dictatorial imagery on the country’s most famous cultural site!) Over the next few years Disney racked up several more hits in the country. But then suddenly there was a dramatic and near-total shift away from the studio.

Disney’s 2016 animated film Zootopia ranked 2nd in China with $246MM while Coco ranked 10th with $189MM – huge results for a pair of films respectively set in American-style cities police departments and DMVs as well as Santa Cecilia Mexico and Día de Muertos. But two years later Incredibles 2 set in an American metropolis could only muster 42nd with $52MM 2019’s Toy Story 4 finished 64th with $29MM and even in the release-light 2020 calendar year Soul which focused on a Black jazz musician failed to crack the top 20 netting $58MM. Disney made extensive (and in the U.S. roundly criticized) accommodations to the CCP in order to secure a Chinese release for Mulan which was based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan. But Mulan landed with a thud in China barely grossing $41MM (71% of Soul). Notably Alan Horn the chairman of Disney Motion Pictures had told The Hollywood Reporter a year before Mulan was released that “If Mulan doesn't work in China we have a problem.” Of course it turned out that Mulan imploded worldwide and it was often mocked for its clumsy and incorrect cultural anchors but poor cultural tailoring is far from the only reason the film fell short.

The Pandoran Gauntlet

China is an exaggerated example of the global shift away from Western tentpoles. For years China has been the second-largest film market globally (it’s likely to be the number 1 once the pandemic finally settles). This has enabled the country to produce and support more films than any other market. In addition the CCP controls the fate of foreign films—including release date the number of weeks its in theater and which films it competes with—and often uses this influence to boost the prospects of domestic productions. The government has also had a long-running strategy to specifically build up domestic capability. In the early 2000s China began relaxing its import restrictions on Hollywood films. By the late 2000s the CCP began to “encourage” Hollywood to promote Chinese actors and products. This is why the 2012 James Bond title Skyfall includes a prominent set piece in Macau while Iron Man 3 features famous Chinese actors who perform surgery on lead Tony Stark (the roles of the surgeons are expanded in the Chinese release) and who then reappear in Avengers: Age of Ultron without any explanation. It’s also the same reason that why Captain America uses a Chinese-made Vivo smartphone in his films even though the device isn’t even available in his home country. Around the same time China began to push for co-financing of Western projects while the country’s media-tech giants began making a number of investments into Hollywood (e.g. Wanda with AMC and Legendary Alibaba into Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Tencent with Skydance China Media Capital into Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine as well as CAA etc.). But by 2018 China and its companies had refocused their investments on its domestic industry. In 2021 Wanda exited the last of its stake in AMC with Legendary sold a year later.

Though China is obviously a unique marketplace it’s easy to read too much into governmental decisions and investments which accelerated but did not create the outcomes listed above (though there are reports that on occasion filmgoers were advise to buy a ticket for domestic film A but then walk into the specific theater showing foreign film B). Historically Hollywood has been the only market capable of making high-quality productions and especially high-quality blockbusters. No one else had the industry the talent the capital and the business model. But that is rapidly changing.

An entire generation has taught itself how to shoot edit graphically augment and develop an audience for their content via TikTok YouTube and Snapchat. The cost of both training and production continues to drop while the tools continue to improve. The rise of game engines in film production will further lower the cost and complexity of filmmaking while unlocking new opportunities for filmmakers. LED volumes remain scarce and costly but they are far cheaper than traveling to a foreign locale and securing permits (The Mandalorian has roughly half of the budget of a typical Star Wars film with a running time three times as long). And in an LED volume the director has perfect control over their set and shot. A sunrise can be both perfect and last for as long as filming - and can seamlessly be retrieved a day a month or a year later while the sand dunes of Tunisia or the mythical forests of Zhangjiajie can be licensed for a few hundred dollars (finally we can stop using the Vasquez Rocks for every foreign planet!). Rather than pay dozens of extras in the backgrounds systems to simulate dense city streets will supply these roles with software able to instantly add subtract move and alter these characters (and years after production too).

These technologies are not yet fully mature of course but the progression is clear. In 2009 the original sci-fi epic District 9 made by first-time South African director Neill Blomkamp was shot on location in Johannesburg for $30MM and garnered an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture. Or consider the 2019 film Koma from Russia. It’s not very good but its visuals often exceed those of the Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan film Inception and it has far more SFX shots too. Such a film was impossible even ten years ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1Z2xlbmV3c3BhcGVycy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8wNi8xNi9uZXdzL3RoZS1ncmFuZC1nYXJkZW4tb3BlbnMtYXQtdGhlLW1vcnRvbi1hcmJvcmV0dW0tc2VwdC0xOC8xOTY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Grand Garden opens at The Morton Arboretum Sept. 18,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1Z2xlbmV3c3BhcGVycy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8wNi8xNi9uZXdzL3RoZS1ncmFuZC1nYXJkZW4tb3BlbnMtYXQtdGhlLW1vcnRvbi1hcmJvcmV0dW0tc2VwdC0xOC8xOTY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950D8B8E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Opening an investment account can be a daunting task. Researching fee structures account types and product features take time and can be perplexing. Plus with so many companies offering investment services it can be tough to know if you’re making a wise decision. Fortunately this guide breaks down two major investment companies: Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab. If you’re hoping for help in automating your investments you may want to work with a financial advisor instead.

Overview of Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab

Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab are giant financial companies offering clients investment services. Each has different features and advantages so your financial circumstances will determine which one’s services are best for you.

Schwab also known as Charles Schwab unites a range of financial services under one roof. It has no trade or account minimums for its investment funds. Plus Schwab clients can invest in actively and passively managed funds. In addition investors can use a hi-tech robo-advisor tool to automate their investments.

Schwab recently acquired TD Ameritrade enhancing its services for clients wanting to trade international currencies. By 2023 it will fully assimilate TD Ameritrade’s functions into its platform. Schwab currently manages about $8 trillion in customer assets.

Merrill Lynch is an investing service operating under Bank of America’s ownership. It offers three investment services: Merrill Edge® Self-Directed Merrill Guided Investing and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Each service has incrementally higher fees and investment minimums and more sophisticated investing tools. It currently manages about $2.75 trillion in assets.

Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab: Fees

One of the ways major brokerage platforms compete is by lowering fees. Merrill Lynch and Schwab are no exception. Here is a breakdown of the major fees for both investment platforms so that you can compare the aspect of the tool you want to use the most.

Charles Schwab Fees

Schwab takes no commissions for online stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and option transactions. Plus it charges nothing for trading mutual funds or bonds. However it charges $0.65 per options contract and $2.25 per futures contract. Broker-assisted trades cost $25 and contacting customer service is free.

In addition investors with less cash can purchase partial shares of stock indexes for $5 apiece. Investors transferring assets out of their accounts will pay $15 to $25. Schwab’s robo-advisor accounts have a $5000 minimum with no fees. Investors with $25000 can open an Intelligent Portfolio Premium account for $300 plus a $30 monthly advisory fee. This account blends robo-advising and certified financial planner services.

Story continues

Schwab’s margin rates range from 10.575% for loans under $25000 to 8.825% for loans of $250000 to $499999. Merrill Lynch does not publicize specific margin rates requiring customers to inquire about current rates. They base your margin rate on your debt load the base lending rate and your assets with Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.

Merrill Lynch Fees

Merrill Edge® Self-Directed is Merrill Lynch’s basic investing account. It charges no commissions for online stock ETFs and options trades. No minimum is necessary to get started.

Various fees apply to clients holding ETFs. Contacting customer service is free.

Merrill Lynch Services and Features

Merrill Lynch has human financial advisors that directly interact with clients for a fee.

However these features don’t apply to the Merrill Edge® Self-Directed account a no-frills investment tool that places control in the client’s hands.

Merrill Lynch vs. Schwab: Online and Mobile Experience

Both companies’ apps have favorable ratings but customer feedback contains numerous complaints. Schwab sometimes can overwhelm the average user with data. However it offers an intuitive interface on mobile and desktop. That said active traders will probably like the Schwab Street Smart desktop version because the mobile version lacks certain features. Schwab Mobile has a 4.8-star rating on the Apple store and 3.7 stars on Google Play. On the other hand Schwab’s Street Smart mobile app has 1.5 stars on the Apple store and 2.2 stars on Google Play.

Merrill Lynch has two mobile apps as well: the Merrill Edge app for Edge clients and MyMerrill for Guided Investing and Wealth Management members. Edge app users praise its ease of use and availability of investment research. It holds a 4.6-star rating on the Apple store and 4 stars on Google Play.

MyMerrill users give similar feedback and emphasize its streamlined nature especially for Bank of America customers. The app has a 4.7-star rating on the Apple Store and 4 stars on Google Play.

Who Should Use Which Investment Platform?

Merrill Lynch and Schwab both offer low-fee accessible investment options for investors. As a result novice investors prioritizing inexpensive investing could be satisfied opening an account with either company.

However the companies diverge from that point. Investors who want to use a robo-advisor are more likely to go with Schwab as Merrill Lynch does not offer a pure robo-advisor option. Additionally investors who want to dive deep into the data may prefer Schwab which provides additional investing tools and analysis through its Street Smart platform.

On the other hand wealthier investors who prefer white-glove treatment may be drawn to Merrill Lynch’s services. Its Guided Investing and Wealth Management products provide a dedicated financial advisor who can help you create a financial plan and invest accordingly.

The Bottom Line

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar. And Wall Street firms have started up hundreds of brand-new E.S.G. dedicated funds — seeking to cash in on growing investor demand for such investments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC93b3JjZXN0ZXItY291bnR5LXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXRyYW5zZmVycy1zdW5kYXktc2VwdC0xOC8xMDM4NzQxMDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worcester County real estate transfers Sunday Sept. 18,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC93b3JjZXN0ZXItY291bnR5LXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXRyYW5zZmVycy1zdW5kYXktc2VwdC0xOC8xMDM4NzQxMDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952EE3010>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Sharanjit was officially ‘installed’ with a celebration event on Wednesday 8th May in the grounds of the Newton Park campus.

The first female Chancellor of Bath Spa University (BSU) and only the second Chancellor in the institution’s almost 20-year history Sharanjit will act as an ambassador for the university on a local national and global stage.

A former BBC World News anchor as well as a leading business and politics reporter her career took her all over the world for almost a quarter of a century.

She now regularly moderates high-level debates for the United Nations multilateral and financial institutions and advises companies and educational institutions on media strategy and diversity.

Living between Bath and her native Singapore Sharanjit is also a Trustee for the Bath Fashion Museum and a Board member at the Holburne Museum. She said she is delighted to become part of the Bath Spa University community to represent the values of students and staff worldwide.

Educated in North America with an undergraduate degree in Journalism and a Master’s in English Sharanjit says she understands what a privilege it is to study have an education and to be curious about the world.

She said: “I stand here because of the socially uplifting power of education that has transformed my life. My late father Kernail Singh Leyl was born in Singapore to a poor immigrant family and was one of eight children.

“He excelled academically and made it to the country’s most prestigious school. He did it through sheer grit and hard work.

“So determined was he to be educated that he studied by streetlamp at a time when Singapore was a developing country and didn’t have reliable electricity coverage.

“Through all his efforts he won scholarships and became the first person to go to university in my family which has led to a completely different life for my brothers and me. It’s a story that truly exemplifies the transformative power of education.

She said her father’s story isn’t a far cry from many of the students at Bath Spa University.

“Over 40% of the BSU student population are among the first in their family to go to university just like my father did. About a quarter of our students are from ethnic minorities like me and many more are working their way through university holding down one or more jobs so they can afford to have an education.

“It shows the sheer grit and determination of the students here at BSU who are so much like my father students whom I’m inspired by and so proud to represent and truly embodying the spirit of Bath Spa University – The Sunday Times University of the year for Social Inclusion.”

Bath Spa University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Sue Rigby welcomed Sharanjit to the BSU community during the ceremony with pledges music and performances from students and staff.

Sharanjit will be presenting certificates to some students at BSU’s summer graduation ceremonies as well as attending numerous informal and more formal events throughout the academic year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbWVyc2V0bGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3NvbWVyc2V0LW5ld3MvdHdvLW1pbmktZm9yZXN0cy1wbGFudGVkLWFjcm9zcy05Mjc2NTE20gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29tZXJzZXRsaXZlLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc29tZXJzZXQtbmV3cy90d28tbWluaS1mb3Jlc3RzLXBsYW50ZWQtYWNyb3NzLTkyNzY1MTYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two mini-forests planted across Bath,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Two 'mini-forests' and almost 1000 trees have been planted across Bath since winter in an effort to help the local environment. The 'mini forests' were planted at Oval Park and Stirtingale Park along with a massive 50 metres of hedgerow at Stirtingale.

More Trees for B&NES and Curo a local housing association also planted 125 standalone trees across the city. Senior Arboriculturalist and Contracts Manager Gordon Stuart said: “A huge thank you to all the volunteers local residents and Curo colleagues who came along to help with this winter’s planting projects.

Bath Salts are essential for using the Crossroads Hot Springs an area of the Crossroads that allows you to sit and bathe with a character of your choice for a while and get to know them a little better. Hades 2 isn't just a roguelite it's a story about characters and relationships. And what better way to learn about the backstory of Doom himself than by inviting him for a soak?

In this quick guide we'll walk you through how to get more Bath Salts for use at the Hot Springs in Hades 2.

How to get Bath Salts in Hades 2

There are two ways to get Bath Salts in Hades 2:

Purchase Bath Salts from the Wretched Broker at the Crossroads.

Dig up Bath Salts with the Silver Spade during a run.

Of these two methods by far the easiest and most reliable is to purchase your Bath Salts from the Wretched Broker back at your home in the Crossroads. The Wretched Broker appears permanently near the Cauldron after you complete the ""Summoning Of Mercantile Fortune"" Incantation. The Broker will begin to sell Bath Salts after you enact the ""Rite Of Vapor-Cleansing"" Incantation to unlock the Crossroads Hot Springs.

To purchase Bath Salts simply interact with the Wretched Broker and navigate to the ""Exotic Goods"" tab of their shop. Here you can purchase 1x Bath Salts for 50x Bones. However you can only do this once per visit to the Crossroads. If you want to get more you'll need to go on a run and then come back to the Crossroads to purchase another vial of Bath Salts.

If you want a regular supply of Bath Salts there's no better place for it than the Wretched Broker's shop. | Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/Supergiant Games

The only alternative to purchasing Bath Salts from the Wretched Broker is to get lucky while digging up hidden loot with the Silver Spade. You can find Digging Spots scattered across every region of both the Underworld and the Surface and occasionally you may get Bath Salts from one of these Digging Spots. However it's certainly not a reliable or fast way of gaining Bath Salts so you should work on earning at least 50x Bones with each run so you can return home and purchase Bath Salts from the Broker.

What are Bath Salts used for in Hades 2?

Just like Nectar Bath Salts in Hades 2 are used to further your relationship with certain characters. Giving someone Bath Salts essentially means you're inviting them to sit with you in the Crossroads Hot Springs for a while. If they accept then you will be treated to a dialogue cutscene where the two characters may become a little closer in some way.

Listed below are all the characters you can give Bath Salts to and what you need to give them before they'll accept the invitation to the Hot Springs:

Dora (1x Nectar)

(1x Nectar) Odysseus (1x Nectar)

(1x Nectar) Hecate (2x Nectar)

(2x Nectar) Moros (2x Nectar)

(2x Nectar) Eris (3x Nectar)

(3x Nectar) Nemesis (4x Nectar 1x Twin Lures)

That's all there is to the mystery of gaining new Bath Salts in Hades 2. While you're here why not consult our other guides on how to get other rare items like Shadow Bronze and Thalamus? You can also check out our guides on the best Boons Keepsakes Weapons and Arcana Cards."

He came on as a substitute during his side’s 3-0 win over Brentford aged 15 years and 181 days.

Here the PA news agency looks at the other youngest players to feature in England’s top-flight since 1992.

Harvey Elliott (Fulham) – 16 years 30 days

The midfielder came off the bench during Fulham’s 1-0 loss at Wolves in May 2019. He made one other brief appearance for the Cottagers that season before moving to Liverpool where he has played 14 times in the top-flight.

Matthew Briggs (Fulham) – 16 years 65 days

The left-back became the Premier League’s youngest ever player when he replaced Moritz Voltz in Fulham’s 3-1 defeat at Middlesbrough in May 2007. He made 29 appearances for the Cottagers. Since leaving permanently in 2015 he has played for a number of clubs in the English lower leagues and Denmark and currently plays for Gosport Borough. A former England Under-21 international he now represents Guyana.

The midfielder now 19 made his top-flight debut for Albion as a late substitute in their 3-2 loss at home to Wigan in May 2013. He joined Chelsea that summer but only made one substitute appearance for the Blues’ first team. After a host of loan spells away from Stamford Bridge he joined Preston in 2021 but was released this year following an injury-hit campaign and is currently without a club.

A move to Spurs happened two years later and he went on to win 21 England caps. After 10 years at White Hart Lane Lennon joined Everton in 2015. He has since had two spells with Burnley either side of a year playing in Turkey but is currently a free agent.

In July 2015 he was suspended by the Football Association for failing an out-of-competition drugs test while at Sheffield United who then suspended him in 2016 for an unspecified reason. He rejoined Everton and then Oldham before signing for Plymouth in 2019. He retired aged 29 in 2021 after a year playing in America.",,,,,,

Warren Buffett invests in a slew of industries through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%). From textiles to insurance to manufacturing to utilities to financial services to real estate Buffett's focus is on industries with a proven track record of growth demand and profitability.

When it comes to real estate there are three sectors in this industry that Buffett is focusing on right now. Does that mean you should too? Let's take a closer look at the sectors and how investors might benefit from buying in.

1. Brokerages: There is one that's set to outpace Berkshire

Liz Brumer-Smith (eXp World Holdings): HomeServices of America is Berkshire Hathaway's real estate brokerage firm. Focused primarily on residential home sales the brokerage has roughly 46000 real estate agents in over 900 brokerage offices in 33 states plus the District of Columbia. If you add in HomeServices of America's franchise network of around 360 franchisees it brings its agent total to 99000 making it the largest brokerage firm in the world.

Brokerage firms earn revenue from each sale their agents make. The more agents a brokerage has the more money it can potentially make. The residential real estate market has been on fire over the last few years which has been great for brokerage firms across the board. Although sales are slumping now over rising concerns about a housing market correction the business model at its core can still manage long-term profitability.

The only real estate brokerage that can even come close to effectively competing with HomeServices of America is eXp World Holdings (EXPI 0.16%). That makes it a potentially fantastic buy to gain exposure to this profitable sector of the industry. eXp World Holdings is a virtual brokerage meaning it doesn't maintain brick-and-mortar offices in cities across the U.S. the way HomeServices of America does. Yet it still managed to build a network of over 84000 agents in 22 markets across the globe (who work remotely from home).

The company is by far the fastest-growing brokerage today. In the past two years it's increased its agent numbers by 180% while expanding into 18 new countries. Unsurprisingly its revenue has soared. Since the company went public in 2015 its earnings per share (EPS) have grown by 37000% while its free cash flow has increased by 138000%. The company also has a major advantage over other brokerages in that it carries zero debt.

There are certainly headwinds for the brokerage firm the most obvious being the housing market slowdown which could affect its revenue in the coming years. The company's stock-sharing incentive program for agents could also have a dilutive impact on share values if the company doesn't maintain its share repurchasing program. But at the moment there is no major cause for concern. Its second-quarter revenue rose by 42% year over year gross profit was up 34% and it repurchased $50 million of stock in Q2 2022. It pays a $0.18 per share annual dividend which yields 1.33%.

The stock took quite the beating in the tech crash this year and trades down roughly 63% year to date making today's pricing an opportune time to get in.

2. Title insurance: Buy the big dog in a sector Berkshire competes in

Mike Price (First American Financial): In addition to residential real estate brokering HomeServices of America offers a host of other real estate services including mortgage originations and banking property and casualty insurance home warranties relocation services and title insurance. I want to drill down into that last category: title insurance.

Every home purchased with a mortgage is required to have title insurance. There is no central database in the U.S. with all title history so purchasing title insurance protects both the homeowner and the lender from an asset purchase where the seller doesn't actually have a strong claim to the title.

Title insurance companies typically do a load of research to trace the title sometimes back decades and then offer to insure once they are reasonably sure that the seller has true title. The title company also usually offers closing services to ensure that the deed of trust (or whatever the local term is) is correctly filed. This is an important point -- if the title research process is done correctly there shouldn't be a risk because the title company can prove that the title is legitimate and was transferred correctly.

First American Financial (FAF 0.43%) is the 800-pound gorilla in the title insurance space. According to a recent management presentation First American has a 23.1% market share in the title and settlement services sector. Its revenue is up 12.4% annually over the last five years and cash flow is up even more over that timeframe at 17.9% annually. It rode the bull market in real estate to new heights as a company.

The question is how it will do through a potential bear market in real estate? Interest rates are up prices are starting to drop and sales are slowing. Fewer home sales mean less revenue for First American.

This downturn isn't the company's first. First American managed well through the dot-com bust the Great Recession and the pandemic. Company management projects that new purchase and refinance originations in 2022 and 2023 will still be higher than what the company did in 2019 -- and any other year after 2007.

Even if the downturn is far worse than management projects the company can simply stand by investing the revenue it gets from existing premium payments and waiting for the market to come back. If a downturn forces its competitors out of business that just means more potential new customers.

3. Affordable housing: Berkshire believes in it. Do you?

Kristi Waterworth (LGI Homes): Buffett is a big fan of affordable housing. With his acquisition of Clayton Homes in 2003 he demonstrated this by putting his money to work investing in housing for the average Joe. Although Clayton Homes is mostly known for manufactured housing it completed approximately 11000 site-built homes across 12 states in 2021 as Clayton Properties Group.

Like Clayton Properties Group LGI Homes (LGIH -0.03%) focuses on affordable housing which is a niche in the construction industry that remains terribly underserved.

LGI Homes stand out from the competition and it looks similar to Clayton Properties Group because of its ability to make affordable housing widely available and also profitable. An average LGI Homes property sold for $356719 in the second quarter versus an average of $403800 for an existing home in the U.S. in July 2022.

In the second quarter LGI Homes' community count decreased to 91.3 (from 105 in Q2 2021). But its gross margin on each home sold has increased to 32% in Q2 from 27% last year. The improved margins give the company a little more wiggle room to maintain operations should real estate prices drop further due to rising interest rates.

Overall the real estate market continues to suffer from a lack of existing home inventory with just 3.3 months of supply available in July 2022. Economists at the National Association of Realtors consider six months of inventory to be a healthy amount and the industry has not seen that number for years. Even at 3.3 months the market is still 45% below that six-month mark. That shortage bodes well for LGI Homes.

Home builders -- especially affordable housing builders -- are just as important as ever regardless of what the headlines on rising mortgage rates might imply and LGI Homes is a quality builder with stock that can be had for a bargain right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL291dGJvdW5kLWludmVzdG1lbnQvZ2ljLW9hay1zdHJlZXQtanYtYnV5aW5nLW91dC1zdG9yZS1jYXBpdGFsLXJlaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GIC Leads $14B Buyout of Warren Buffett’s Only REIT Investment GIC-Oak Street JV Buying Out Store Capital REIT,"Singapore’s GIC is making its second mega-bet on the US property market within the last month with the sovereign wealth fund having joined with an American partner to buy Warren Buffett’s favourite REIT for $14 billion in cash.

GIC teamed up with Oak Street a real estate private equity division of New York-based asset manager Blue Owl Capital to sign a definitive agreement to acquire all of the shares in NYSE-listed Store Capital the only REIT which Berkshire Hathaway boss Buffett has invested in.

“We are thrilled to lead this investment in Store Capital given its impressive cash flow profile long-weighted average lease term and highly diversified portfolio with strong rent coverage” said Lee Kok Sun chief investment officer of real estate division at GIC.

The buyout which remains subject to stockholder approval will give GIC and Oak Street ownership of Store Capital’s portfolio of 3012 single-tenant commercial and industrial properties across the United States according to a joint statement on Thursday.

Sale-Leaseback Bonanza

The joint venture is buying out Store at $32.25 per share in cash representing a 20.4 percent increase from its $26.79 stock price on 14 September and a premium of 17.8 percent when compared to its 90-day average share price. On the day of the announcement the trust’s stock rose 20 percent.

“As one of the largest dedicated US net lease real estate companies in a nearly $4 trillion-dollar market Store Capital is a strong addition to GIC’s diverse portfolio of US real estate investments” said Adam Gallistel GIC’s head of Americas real estate. “We are confident the company will continue its trajectory of accretive growth by meeting the demand for long-term financing solutions from middle market US companies.”

The Arizona-based REIT focuses on sale-leaseback transactions through which it buys properties from operating companies occupying the facilities and then rents them back to the vendor. It is also one of America’s biggest net lease real estate platforms – where lease agreements require tenants to pay for additional expenses such as utilities and taxes.

Excluding 16 properties that were vacant the Store portfolio was 99.5 percent occupied with an average lease contract term of 13 years as of 30 June. The trust is letting go of its assets after booking a 19 percent year on year jump in first half revenues worth $445.9 million as reported in its latest operating results.

GIC announced its investment in Store just over two weeks after the sovereign fund was revealed to be the backer of a $1.13 billion buyout of commercial real estate investor and operator Workspace Property Trust.

Store’s properties are dispersed across all US states except Hawaii with Texas Illinois California Georgia Florida and Ohio accounting for a third of its then 2886 assets as of the end of last year according to its most recent annual report.

As of 31 December that portfolio measured 100145 square feet (9304 square metres) in combined built area occupied by tenants across the service retail and manufacturing sectors. Based on revenue share last year the majority or 65 percent was sourced from facilities leased to the service sector 20 percent in the manufacturing sector and 15 percent from retail tenants.

GIC’s Chicago-based partner Oak Street also follows a net lease strategy and is primarily involved in structuring sale-leasebacks as well as providing seed and strategic capital. Oak Street was acquired by Blue Owl last December in a $1.6 billion deal.

The buyout of Store Capital which is subject to approval by Buffett (Berkshire Hathway owned 6928413 shares as of 30 June) and other stockholders is expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year. Store has also been given a 30-day period to solicit and consider other acquisition proposals.

GIC and Oak Street did not disclose their individual ownership stakes in the joint venture.

Monster Deal

“We believe the Store Capital platform complements Oak Street’s exposure to the triple-net industry and our focus on sale-leasebacks” said Oak Street president Marc Zahr. “The potential scale of this combination and partnership can deliver one of the most diversified unique and long dated net lease platforms across the globe.”

The buyout deal if completed would become a “monster” transaction since Store is the third largest publicly traded net lease REIT said Scott Merkle managing partner at SLB Capital Advisors who was not involved in the transaction.

“GIC and Oak Street are acquiring one of the most prolific sale leaseback investors that regularly deploys well north of $1 billion a year” Merkle said in an emailed statement on Friday.

The acquisition would also mark GIC’s second investment in the US net lease sector following a $1.2 billion retail JV it established alongside New York-listed RPT Realty and two other American partners in March 2021.

Eastdil Secured Advisors and Citigroup Global Markets served as financial advisors for GIC and Oak Street in the transaction while Store was assisted by Evercore and Goldman Sachs.

Closings of sale and leaseback deals in the US reached a record high of 236 transactions worth $10.2 billion in the second quarter according to a report by SLB.

GIC Keeps Buying

GIC which ranked as the world’s most active state-owned sovereign wealth fund last year is beefing up its exposure overseas having signed three deals worth more than $15.6 billion since August.

Late last month the Singaporean investor reportedly backed Florida-based real estate investor and operator Workspace Property Trust in purchasing a majority stake in 41 suburban office assets with combined space of eight million square feet (743224 square metres).

The $1.13 billion acquisition was supplemented by debt financing from JP Morgan and Canada’s Bank of Montreal.

Earlier in August GIC made a bet Down Under with a purchase of a half stake in an A$800 million ($568 million) Melbourne office project from Australian property giant Charter Hall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L3RoZS11bHRpbWF0ZS1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS10YXgtZG9kZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Entrepreneurs can avoid taxes by donating their companies,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/09/17/the-ultimate-billionaire-tax-dodge on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L3RoZS11bHRpbWF0ZS1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS10YXgtZG9kZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

That's the outlook from airlines and the tourism industry going into the fall travel season and looking forward to the winter holidays.

Hopper a travel agency that analyzes data for airfare price predictions is seeing strong booking demand for holiday travel after an ""extraordinary"" summer.

The pent-up demand after two pandemic years is in part because for some travelers this will be the first time they visit family for the holidays since COVID-19 erupted said Hopper spokeswoman Lindsay Schwimer.

""Last year omicron was surging around the holiday season so people will be eager to take holiday trips this year and see family and friends"" she said.

Expect huge demand for holiday flights in 2022

Though it's too early to tell just how busy the fall and winter holidays will be – AAA doesn't issue its seasonal travel outlooks until two weeks before the holiday – some indicators suggest travelers should expect end-of-year travel will be just as busy as the summer.

TripAdvisor's fall travel survey which forecasts trends from September to November showed 6 of 10 Americans plan to travel this fall. About 49% plan to fly.

At the Cowen 2022 Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference which took place virtually American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the airline's leisure bookings ""remain strong"" past Labor Day.

""As we take a look forward into the future I'm pleased with how we've managed through the summer and rebounded through the pandemic"" he said.

Airlines are hiring more workers

This summer was a challenge for flying: Many flights were delayed or canceled. Staffing shortages were a big contributor to that.

About 2.3 million fewer aviation jobs existed worldwide in September 2021 down 21% from pre-pandemic levels according to Oxford Economics. That included about 340000 fewer jobs in the airline industry.

Airlines are taking steps to improve their operations.

U.S. airline employment in June 2022 increased by 6775 workers to a total of 767263 including 458136 full-time passenger airline workers according to the most recent data from the Department of Transportation. That's an increase from the same month in 2019 before the pandemic.

Three airlines drove the increase: Delta Air Lines hired 2981 people that month United Airlines added 1322 and Southwest Airlines added 1007.

A more luxurious option:KLM introduces Premium Comfort to New York

Airlines for America a trade group representing U.S. airlines said its seven-member passenger carriers – Alaska American Delta Hawaiian JetBlue Southwest and United – were staffed with 10% more pilots per block hour compared with before the pandemic.

(In the airline industry block hours measure the time from when an aircraft's door closes at departure to when it opens at arrival.)

American Airlines hired about 12000 people across a variety of job categories last year Isom said during the conference. He also said the company is ""making good progress"" as American continued hiring through the summer to prepare for the coming months.

But there will be fewer flights this fall

Despite the staffing growth airlines still don't have enough workers to meet the demand.

Many responded by removing flights from their schedules.

""Flight schedules for September and October are down by 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels and carriers are reducing September flights by 5% compared to what was planned at the start of the summer"" Airlines for America spokeswoman Marli Collier said.

""Airlines set their schedules months in advance and are constantly evaluating to optimize performance and prioritize smooth operations.""

Mother-daughter pilot duo:Pair makes history at Hawaiian Airlines

American Airlines which operates the majority of flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport recently published its final schedule for November that showed 30000 fewer flights.

A spokesman for American Airlines Brian Metham said the airline works off what it calls a ""placeholder schedule"" which is published about a year in advance and adjusts it closer to the time the flights are scheduled.

Its final schedule is published about 100 days in advance he said. On average American operates nearly 5300 departures daily nationwide.

American's full-year flight capacity for 2022 is forecast to end about 7.5% to 9.5% lower than before the pandemic Metham said.

How to book your holiday 2022 flights

► Don't delay: Industry experts suggest travelers book their flights as soon as possible.

Now through Oct. 20 is when consumers will find the best airfares for Thanksgiving and the December holidays Schwimer said. Higher prices and limited options are likely after mid-October.

""There are still deals available now for the holidays which is why we recommend booking as soon as you see a price you’re comfortable with"" she said.

► Save money by flying off-peak: Avoiding peak travel days can result in savings.

Expedia found in its flight data for Thanksgiving that travelers could save an average 5% on airfare by flying on the Sunday Monday or Tuesday before the holiday instead of Wednesday.

""For some destinations the savings are even bigger – average ticket prices for Las Vegas for example drop from around $550 to $380 (round trip) just by changing the departure date to earlier in the week"" said Francheska Taveras spokeswoman for the Expedia Group.

► The two best days to fly: For travelers flexible on their dates or waiting until the last minute Schwimer said the best deals for the holidays are when the fewest travelers are expected: Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve.

This specification packs in a Ryzen 9 6900HS processor Radeon RX 6700S GPU 1TB NVMe SSD 16GB of DDR5 and a 14-in 1440p 120Hz screen - and it's been discounted from $1650 to $1350 saving you $300. That's an awesome price for this level of performance all in a compact 14-in chassis that's easy to tote around or work with on the go.

My love affair with the G14 has been going on for some time but the latest generation G14 reviewed by James earlier this year represents an absolute pinnacle of achievement by the Taiwanese company. He tested the top-spec version with an RX 6800S GPU but the overall lessons still apply here - performance is strong with the machine being plenty capable of running AAA games at 1440p 60fps while esports titles can make excellent use of the 120Hz refresh rate. The screen looks great with its taller 16:10 aspect ratio good contrast and accurate colours and the keyboard and trackpad are also strong performers - great if you like to bang out deals articles on the train to take a completely random example.

Gaming battery life is the one real downside with James recording less than an hour's use in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at max brightness... although the more modest components in this model should result in better longevity too. Ray tracing is not a strength either like other all-AMD builds and the absence of DLSS is a shame in a world where FSR 2.0 has yet to gain widespread adoption despite relatively strong results. Still these are fairly common weaknesses amongst other laptops with the same specs so there's little to really complain about with Asus' design decisions.

We know fridge shopping isn’t the most fun thing ever but considering that you use your refrigerator several times each day it’s one of those purchases you should really think about carefully.

Unlike top freezer models a bottom-freezer refrigerator typically has more storage options in a convenient eye-level design making it great for families that need more space and organization. It also fits in well with many modern home aesthetics and is capable of being equipped with more smart capabilities and other features like water dispensers. And yes let’s not forget about pull-out freezer drawers!

The Best Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators

What to Consider

Cost: First things first: Buying a fridge can cost a pretty penny. Some customized and upmarket models can run upwards of $3000 so establishing a clear budget from the outset is always a good idea.

Size: When it comes to major appliances you also want to think about how much real estate it will take up in your kitchen (or basement if that’s your thing). Bottom-freezer refrigerators can range in size from about 11 to 28 cubic feet so consider what makes the most sense for your space and kitchen’s layout.

Style: When buying a bottom-freezer refrigerator (also called a bottom-mount refrigerator) aesthetic considerations matter. For a modern clean look stainless steel is a great choice. Colored glass with a high-gloss finish can be a fun element but may show fingerprints more easily.

Energy Star Rating: We also recommend looking for bottom-freezer refrigerators with an Energy Star rating. This will not only help you save on your electricity bill but is also a win for your environmental footprint.

Thankfully we did the careful perusing for you — poring over countless refrigerator reviews and searching the internet for the best bottom fridges available — so you can just think about what you prioritize: a slim footprint ice maker or multiple freezer drawers. Our favorite bottom-freezer refrigerators are all best-in-class picks and available for online purchase so you can rest assured your frozen goods are in well good hands. Happy shopping!

Over 100 economists and development experts have called on BlackRock and other creditors to cancel a significant amount of Zambia’s debt. In an open letter released today the signatories – including Jeffrey Sachs Jayati Ghosh Philip Alston Raj Patel and Cephas Lumina – call for a large-scale debt restructuring and for the UK and New York to pass legislation to ensure that all private creditors comply with the G20 G20 The Group of Twenty (G20 or G-20) is a group made up of nineteen countries and the European Union whose ministers central-bank directors and heads of state meet regularly. It was created in 1999 after the series of financial crises in the 1990s. Its aim is to encourage international consultation on the principle of broadening dialogue in keeping with the growing economic importance of a certain number of countries.

Zambia is starting negotiations with private creditors this month to reduce the amount of debt owed. On 6 September the IMF called for $8.4 billion of Zambia’s debt payments between 2022 and 2025 to be cancelled.

In the letter the experts say:

“Because of the high interest rates Interest rates When A lends money to B B repays the amount lent by A (the capital) as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that A has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation. The interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low. To take a very simple example: if A borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5% the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed (10 million dollars) plus 5% of the capital owed i.e. 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars. In the second year he will again repay 10% of the capital borrowed but the 5% now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i.e. 4.5 million dollars or a total of 14.5 million dollars. And so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5% of that remaining 10 million dollars i.e. 0.5 million dollars giving a total of 10.5 million dollars. Over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127.5 million dollars. The repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments. In the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years. In this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher…



The nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted. The real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation. and the fact Zambia’s bonds have been trading Market activities

trading Buying and selling of financial instruments such as shares futures derivatives options and warrants conducted in the hope of making a short-term profit. at well below face value since 2018 many bondholders stand to make huge profits at the expense of both Zambian citizens and creditor countries if paid at face value. It is therefore imperative that BlackRock and other bondholders agree to fully engage in a large-scale debt restructuring including significant haircuts in order to make Zambia’s debt sustainable.”

They continue:

“Zambia’s bonds are all governed by English law. In 2010 the UK parliament passed a ground-breaking Act to enforce a previous debt relief scheme the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Heavily Indebted Poor Countries

HIPC In 1996 the IMF and the World Bank launched an initiative aimed at reducing the debt burden for some 41 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) whose total debts amount to about 10% of the Third World Debt. The list includes 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.



The idea at the back of the initiative is as follows: a country on the HIPC list can start an SAP programme of twice three years. At the end of the first stage (first three years) IMF experts assess the ’sustainability’ of the country’s debt (from medium term projections of the country’s balance of payments and of the net present value (NPV) of debt to exports ratio.

If the country’s debt is considered “unsustainable” it is eligible for a second stage of reforms at the end of which its debt is made ’sustainable’ (that it it is given the financial means necessary to pay back the amounts due). Three years after the beginning of the initiative only four countries had been deemed eligible for a very slight debt relief (Uganda Bolivia Burkina Faso and Mozambique). Confronted with such poor results and with the Jubilee 2000 campaign (which brought in a petition with over 17 million signatures to the G7 meeting in Cologne in June 1999) the G7 (group of 7 most industrialised countries) and international financial institutions launched an enhanced initiative: “sustainability” criteria have been revised (for instance the value of the debt must only amount to 150% of export revenues instead of 200-250% as was the case before) the second stage in the reforms is not fixed any more: an assiduous pupil can anticipate and be granted debt relief earlier and thirdly some interim relief can be granted after the first three years of reform.



Simultaneously the IMF and the World Bank change their vocabulary : their loans which so far had been called “enhanced structural adjustment facilities” (ESAF) are now called “Growth and Poverty Reduction Facilities” (GPRF) while “Structural Adjustment Policies” are now called “Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper”. This paper is drafted by the country requesting assistance with the help of the IMF and the World Bank and the participation of representatives from the civil society.

This enhanced initiative has been largely publicised: the international media announced a 90% even a 100% cancellation after the Euro-African summit in Cairo (April 2000). Yet on closer examination the HIPC initiative turns out to be yet another delusive manoeuvre which suggests but in no way implements a cancellation of the debt.

The UK should do the same again to ensure that all private creditors comply with the terms of G20 Common Framework debt restructurings. New York – the other key jurisdiction for sovereign debts – should do the same.”

The signatories conclude by saying:

“At a time of global crisis it is economically inefficient and morally wrong for high interest Interest An amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender. Interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set. debts to be paid to private lenders while governments cut back on support for their own people. The world urgently needs a strengthened scheme to deliver debt restructuring for countries and people in need.”

Zambia first applied for debt relief through the G20’s Common Framework for Debt Restructuring in February 2021. No debt has yet been restructured but in July 2022 government lenders including China agreed in principle to conclude a restructuring in line with the IMF IMF

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.



When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.



As for the World Bank a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 1768% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).



The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (1674%) Japan (623%) Germany (581%) France (429%) and the UK (429%).

The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (657% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (155% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar. And Wall Street firms have started up hundreds of brand-new E.S.G. dedicated funds — seeking to cash in on growing investor demand for such investments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0RvZ3Mtc2VpemVkLWZyb20tc3VzcGVuZGVkLUNULWNvcC1zLWZhY2lsaXR5LTE3NDQ5ODM2LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dogs seized from suspended CT cop's facility form state police's first K-9 comfort program,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/Dogs-seized-from-suspended-CT-cop-s-facility-17449836.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0RvZ3Mtc2VpemVkLWZyb20tc3VzcGVuZGVkLUNULWNvcC1zLWZhY2lsaXR5LTE3NDQ5ODM2LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L211bHRpbmF0aW9uYWwtc2hvb3QtaG91c2UtZXhlcmNpc2UtaW4tZmlqaXMtbmV3LWJsYWNrcm9jay1jYW1wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multinational shoot-house exercise in Fiji's new Blackrock Camp,"United States Fijian New Zealand Australian soldiers and British Gurkhas trained each other over new strategies to enter a shoot house and adequately clear a building during the urban-training phase of Exercise Cartwheel earlier this month.

CAPTION: Australian Corporal Louis Carbery an infantry soldier with 8/9RAR discusses how his army clears hallways and intersections at Blackrock Training Camp Fiji during Exercise Cartwheel. Story and photo by US Army Sergeant Brian D. Jones 343rd Mobile Public Affairs Detachment.

The temporary shoot houses were constructed by the US Army Reserve 797th Engineers Vertical Construction Company from Guam and New Zealand soldiers.

These shoot houses were used to show the different techniques the United States and Australian Armies have developed.

The Australian Army had several personnel demonstrating their tactics of entering a building and navigating hallways during combat scenarios.

Australian Army Corporal Louis Carbery an infantry soldier from the 8th/9th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment specialising in reconnaissance said the purpose of the activity was a training package that his unit developed that specialised in urban warfare.

“We are here to help support a little training mainly to build relationships with the Fijian forces United States government British government Royal Gurkha regiment and New Zealand forces” Corporal Carbery said.

Building a solid relationship with each partner nation is what the Australian Army has come here to do as their primary mission set and it shows how much they care about their job and want to share the skills they have learned.

Captain Harrison Negrone 8/9RAR said the Aussies were working with the Fijian Army the New Zealand Army and the United States Army and we are building relationships and getting the opportunity to cross over and see each other’s urban drills and skills to understand and increase interoperability between the nations.

“We are happy to show the best practices they have developed to help the partner armies and we appreciates the troops’ willingness to learn” Captain Negrone said.

Exercise Cartwheel 2022 was developed to share best practices and build readiness through military-to-military training.

Specialist Connor MacDowell an infantry team leader from 1st Platoon B Company 2nd Battalion 27th Infantry Regiment 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team 25th Infantry Division said the shoot house was fantastic.

“The weather is about the same as Hawaii – a bit more humid – but it’s fun great atmosphere and I am feeling appreciative of the training being presented here in Fiji” Specialist MacDowell said.

“I value how friendly the partner nations have worked alongside the different cultures.

“The Aussies are great – I love them.

“I have family from Australia so it’s nice to be close to family again.

“The Kiwis are fantastic and the Fijians are fun to be around” he said.

The urban training portion of Exercise Cartwheel kicked off the bilateral military-to-military training.

Partner-nation soldiers quickly came together to start the training as a success.

Captain Negrone summed up the atmosphere as an excellent opportunity that’s been put together by all the planning teams.

“Hats off to them it’s been great.

“I like the exercise so far and looking forward to the rest of it.”

The S&P 500 tumbled 20% during the first six months of 2022 its worst first-half decline in half a century. Meanwhile the bond market experienced its worst decline on record. A typical portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds produced its worst return since the Great Depression.

The lackluster returns and nauseating volatility are leading more investors to seek alternatives to the public stock and bond markets. They're increasingly allocating more of their portfolio to alternative investments like private equity hedge funds real estate and infrastructure. Prequin a leading data provider to the alternative asset community sees investments in alternatives rising to more than $17 trillion by 2025 a roughly 10% annual growth rate from 2020's level. That should drive continued growth for leading alternative asset managers Blackstone (BX 0.82%) Brookfield Asset Management (BN -0.04%) and KKR (KKR 1.06%).

Cashing in on alternatives

Blackstone is the king of the alternative asset management sector. The company ended the second quarter with an industry-leading $940.8 billion of assets under management (AUM).

Investors are pouring capital into Blackstone's funds. Inflows were a jaw-dropping $88.3 billion in the second quarter alone. That was its second-best quarter ever and equal to its total AUM at its initial public offering in 2007.

Blackstone's rapidly rising AUM earns it two revenue streams. A large portion is fee-earning AUM ($683.8 billion at the end of the second quarter) which supplies it with recurring management fees. Blackstone recorded $1 billion of fee-related earnings in the second quarter up 45% year over year. In addition Blackstone earns performance revenues as its funds deliver on their return objectives. The company realized a net $1.1 billion of performance earnings in the second quarter boosting its total distributable earnings to over $2 billion.

The company distributes the bulk of this income to shareholders via a dividend that yields over 5%. Blackstone also repurchases shares and invests some capital into its funds to further enhance shareholder value. As more investor capital flows into Blackstone the company's earnings streams will rise enabling it to keep growing shareholder value.

Highlighting the value of asset management

Brookfield is another leading global alternative asset manager. The company had over $750 billion of AUM at the end of the second quarter.

The company currently has two businesses: Asset management and direct investment. Brookfield has historically retained a large percentage of its asset management income for reinvestment in its funds and other investments. However the company plans to separate these two businesses and spin-off a quarter of its asset management business to shareholders. That will enable them to benefit more directly from the value created by its asset management business.

Brookfield expects its asset management business to grow its fee-bearing capital to $1 trillion within the next five years. That positions the company to double its fee-related earnings to over $4 billion and realize significant carried interest (its share of the profits from managed investments). It expects the spun-out asset management business to pay out 90% of that steadily growing income stream to investors via a large and growing dividend. Meanwhile investors will retain the upside of its direct investment strategy positioning them for significant value creation as both businesses grow in the future.

Continuing to grow

KKR is another leading global alternative asset manager poised to capitalize on the rise in alternatives. The company ended the second quarter with $491 billion of AUM up 14% year over year. Of that amount $384 billion was fee-paying AUM a 20% year-over-year increase.

The company has been working to grow and diversify its business. It has increased its real estate AUM by 50% over the last 12 months to $114 billion by launching new funds and other investment products.

KKR's growth strategy has been paying off. Fee-related earnings are up 40% over the past year to $2.2 billion. Meanwhile after-tax distributable earnings have soared 60% to $4.1 billion. KKR pays a portion of that income out via dividends. It also retains earnings to reinvest in its funds positioning shareholders to capitalize on the income and upside produced by those investments. KKR expects to continue growing briskly as it launches new funds and other products to capitalize on the growing desire of investors to allocate more capital to alternative investments.

Capitalizing on the rise of alternatives

Investors continue to pour money into alternative investments with industrywide AUM expected to top $17 trillion by 2025. That will be a huge boon for leading alternative asset managers Blackstone Brookfield and KKR.

Taking place on October 1 from 2pm till 11pm it'll feature a never seen before five hour b2b with Joseph Capriati Loco Dice Seth Troxler The Martinez Brothers and head honcho Yousef all getting involved. Five hour sets are a famed association with Yousef which he described to Mixmag as a way he's able to ""explore musically"".

""I must've done about six or seven over the years and I'll be doing another one this year to celebrate our 20th anniversary"" he added. ""Sometimes I delve into the Circus music classics - not well known records but they're big at Circus and that's what people want to hear - so every now and again I play a couple but not many as I always like to move forward. But yeah we're doing another one this year and they're electric: super super special"".

Both La La and Manda Moor are set to make their Circus debut supported by 20-year Circus resident Lewis Boardman.

It's another party added to the long list of landmark parties organised by the landmark Liverpool club night which hosted the first club night since the pandemic began as a test event last year.

Naturally with its 20 year stint thus far boss Yousef has accumulated a plethora of memories. ""One of them was the 500th Essential Mix which was at The Masque about 10 years ago 11 years ago. We were selected by the BBC and Pete Tong to be the club that hosted the 500th Essential Mix so the line-up was Pete Tong Richie Hawtin myself Sasha and a special guest voted for by the general public which ended up being Aeroplane.

""Just before the gig there was a massive ash cloud explosion in Iceland which completely grounded all flights across Europe - it was almost impossible to get into the UK. The BBC had come to the UK and setup to ensure they could do the live broadcast - all tickets were sold it was hyped up for weeks yet maybe four or five hours before the gig we had no line-up because nobody could get in the country but we were broadcasting live. By chance Tong managed to get in via Calais and Hawtin managed to get in via somewhere like Hull and bit by bit everyone just about made it - we're talking within an hour of the event happening - we just managed to get the line-up together.

BA,Boeing,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9jb3VsZC1ib2Vpbmctc3dpdGNoLXRvLXNpZGVzdGlja3MtZm9yLWl0cy1uZXh0LWpldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Boeing Switch To Sidesticks For Its Next Jet?!,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | September 18 2022

We all know that Boeing aircraft have yokes and Airbuses (A300/310-aside) have sidesticks. But is it possible that Boeing could switch over sooner or later?

A lot of online discussion groups have devoted tens of thousands (or more) of words to the “Boeing Vs Airbus” debate. This takes many forms with discussions on the 737 and A320 historically focusing on fly-by-wire. There is a lot to cover there but this isn’t what this article is about. That’s because wherever you stand on sidesticks we can safely assume that the next Boeing design will be fly-by-wire.

Boeing has designed two “blank-sheet” aircraft in the last three decades: the 777 and the 787. Both of these aircraft are fly-by-wire. Boeing has been mostly silent about the exact design and even the size of its next aircraft as we’ve seen.

Boeing – Yes To FBW No To Sidesticks

However the Boeing 777 and 787 both have yokes not sidesticks. Boeing has been vocal about the advantages of the yoke even in its latest designs. Since the yokes are mechanically linked one pilot can feel the other’s inputs – if there are any which normally there shouldn’t be. Conversely it is impractical to link sidesticks mechanically.

There have also been tragic events where pilots of aircraft with sidesticks did not realize that they were out of trim. This involved cases where the aircraft switched to flight laws whereby it did not auto-trim. These events are quite rare but this is another factor keeping Boeing away from sidesticks.

Of course Airbus and other manufacturers of aircraft with sidesticks have systems and procedures to mitigate these issues. But what if both the “dual-input” problem and the “aircraft-out-of-trim” problems… went away? What would happen if a new sidestick design eliminated both of these potential issues? Could Boeing then reverse its stance towards sidesticks?

As it happens there are already aircraft out there flying with sidesticks that DO solve these issues. The industry refers to them as “active sidesticks”. The first aircraft to use them was the Gulfstream G500 corporate jet. It uses a system designed by BAE who previously made sidesticks for military jets. In the G500 there is no mechanical link between the sidesticks. But they both have servos linking them electronically.

No Gaming Did NOT Get There First!

You might have heard of force-feedback joysticks (don’t worry this is the last use of the “J” word in this article). As their name suggests these devices provide feedback to the user depending on what the simulated aircraft is doing. But gaming wasn’t the first application of this technology. Whatever its future attitude on sidesticks might be Boeing and others have used this principle in aircraft simulators.

BAE isn’t the only company making active sidesticks. There is also a company in France called Ratier-Figeac which is a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace in the US. Collins is itself a subsidiary of Raytheon. Ratier-Figeac has made Airbus’ sidesticks since the introduction of the A320 family in the 1980s. It has also supplied them to Sukhoi for its SuperJet (SSJ100).

And until recently Ratier-Figeac was also a sidestick supplier to Irkut/UAC for the MS-21. The future of the MS-21 is quite uncertain these days. But in the configuration that Russia certified before the invasion of Ukraine the MS-21 had active sidesticks. If it actually enters service in this configuration it will be the first airliner to have them.

So could these developments finally sway Boeing towards sidesticks? The design solves the dual input and out-of-trim issues. It can also vary its resistance to the inputs of pilots accounting for differences in aerodynamic forces at different speeds. Also the sticks move when the aircraft is on autopilot to reflect the system’s control inputs.

An Odd Event (with yokes)

If Boeing adopts them sidesticks would also save a good amount of weight. It is much easier to install two sidesticks than two floor-mounted yokes and all their necessary mechanical connections. Ergonomically sidesticks allow pilots to have better reach to their displays. They make touch-screen MFDs practical for instance. Plus pilots get fold-out tables!

It is also worth noting that even though they don’t use sidesticks Boeing 777s and 787s can have some… “sidestick problems”. In April 2022 we saw a peculiar incident involving Air France flight AF-11. The pilots of a Boeing 777 were on approach to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (LFPG) when they perceived that the aircraft was “fighting” their inputs.

BEA the French investigating authority is still working on this event. But in a press release it revealed that the two pilots were fighting each other. With enough force (50 lbs or 22.7 kg) the two yokes can “desynchronize” i.e. move in different directions. The full report will give us all the details. But the incident shows that even without sidesticks and despite the forces involved current Boeing fly-by-wire aircraft could have such issues.

Sidesticks And Boeing Type Ratings

However making such a design change isn’t that simple. Before it really embraces sidesticks Boeing would have to look at some broader factors. Despite entering service decades apart the 777 and 787 share the same type rating. We don’t know if this is something Boeing could pursue for its next aircraft to ease airline training.

But even if Boeing doesn’t do this fully type rating considerations could still delay the adoption of sidesticks. Airbus for instance has a common type rating for its A330/340/350 families which is different from that of its A320 family. But pilots with one of these ratings can benefit from a shorter/abbreviated course for the other.

If Boeing decides to pursue a similar strategy it will probably continue to eschew sidesticks despite these new innovations. But will it? Boeing has received a lot of criticism for its aircraft development choices regarding type ratings and training requirements. This criticism came not only with the 737 MAX but the 777X as well.

So could the company decide to make a point of moving ahead? Could active sidesticks with their advantages in ergonomics weight savings and pilot feedback lead to a change in direction for Boeing? We will have to wait to find out. If Boeing is to remain competitive with Airbus it will really need to launch its next aircraft in the next two years according to analysts.

I have known Dan Wong for nearly 20 years. He unexpectedly passed away due to a heart attack in his sleep this summer leaving behind his lovely wife Paulin and their two beautiful children Tabitha (24) and Darryl (19).





Dan was and is one of the smartest people I have known. I first met Dan when he was in charge of Air Canada’s flight operation group. Boeing and GE were working hard to sell 777 and 787s to Air Canada as part of their wide body fleet renewal plan.





Dan then moved to Dubai as the VP of Flight Operations for Emirates airlines. Dan was instrumental in helping Boeing and GE shape the 777-300ER replacement aircraft later to become the 777-9.





After a small stint as a professor at the University of Central Missouri Dan joined Boeing as the Director of Airplane Strategy. He eventually was a major factor in recruiting me to join Boeing as the Director of Engine Strategy. 15 years of knowing Dan and I finally was going to be able to work with him. Needless to say our time was way too short as we only spent 18 months working together.





Daniel (as Paulin calls him) was a wonderful husband father and provider for his family. He also was a true mentor teacher and innovator to everyone that was around Dan in a work environment. Dan touched and inspired many many people during his career.





A number of Dan’s colleagues would like to start this Go Fund Me page in memory of Dan to raise funds for two specific causes: Darryl Wong’s college tuition and a donation to a flight school in the Seattle area as a scholarship in memory of Daniel Wong for young students who desire to become a pilot.





Dan was always helping others and giving a little bit back in his honor is the least we can do for ambitious students wanting to learn to fly and to help fund his son’s continuing college education.





Thank you in advance for your generosity to supporting these two wonderful causes."

She was in Washington D.C. to lobby on behalf of her brother when White House officials informed her the president wanted to meet with her on Friday afternoon in the Oval Office.

She makes the hourslong journey by ferry and commuter rail to the nation's Capitol several times a year to advocate for her brother who lived in Novi and worked for auto parts supplier BorgWarner when he was arrested in December 2018 while in Moscow for the wedding of a friend.

Russian authorities allege Paul Whelan now 52 is a spy who was caught with a USB drive containing classified information. Whelan says the charges and his closed-door trial were a setup and that he remains innocent.

He was convicted in a Moscow courtroom in 2020 and sentenced to serve 16 years in a prison work camp.

The U.S. government considers Whelan wrongfully detained and has been negotiating for his release along with that of WNBA star Brittney Griner who was arrested in February when authorities found a vape cartridge containing cannabis oil in her luggage at a suburban Moscow airport. She was convicted on drug charges in July and was sentenced to nine years.

In addition to meeting with Elizabeth Whelan on Friday Biden also separately met with Griner's wife Cherelle Griner to ""reiterate his continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely"" said Karine Jean-Pierre White House press secretary in a statement.

""The president appreciated the opportunity to learn more about Brittney and Paul from those who love them most and acknowledged that every minute they are being held is a minute too long. ... We all admire the courage of the Whelan and Griner families in the face of these unimaginable circumstances and we remain committed to reuniting them with their loved ones.""

Elizabeth Whelan called the meeting ""an exceptional honor"" but told the Detroit Free Press on Saturday that she couldn't share details about what she and Biden discussed.

""The details of the meeting need to remain confidential as this is an active case"" Elizabeth Whelan said. ""And the outcome of any effort by the U.S. requires the active participation in a reasonable good faith manner by the Russian authorities which seems to be something of an issue at this time.

""I am grateful for the continual outreach and info-sharing from the White House National Security Council Department of State and the office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Together with members of Congress we will continue to fight for my brother Paul and all other Americans wrongfully detained.""

In July U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Biden administration had proposed a prisoner exchange that would trade Whelan and Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.

Dubbed ""the Merchant of Death"" Bout was convicted in 2011 on federal terrorism charges in New York. Though he denied the allegations prosecutors said Bout was planning to sell up to $20 million in weapons including surface-to-air missiles to shoot down U.S. helicopters. He was sentenced to 25 years in a federal prison.

Soon after reports emerged that suggested the Russian government wasn't satisfied with the trade deal.

""There have been reports that the Russian government is concerned about the reciprocity of the offer"" David Whelan the twin brother of Paul Whelan told journalists in an email message at the time. ""This might mean that they seek an additional concession from the U.S. government. Or it might mean they are willing to relinquish one fewer concession themselves.""

Jean-Pierre said in a news conference late last week that U.S.-Russian negotiations remain ongoing.

""The Russians should accept our offer ... today"" she said. ""We will keep working diligently until the day we get to share that good news.""

Elizabeth Whelan said she has ""complete faith"" that the Biden administration is fully engaged and using all available tools to bring her brother home.

""Now we need Russia to also engage in good faith and free Paul Whelan"" she said.

""Hostage-diplomacy is a national security as well as a humanitarian issue; when hostile foreign nations take Americans and hold them as pawns we must work together with vigor to reunite those wrongfully detained with their families and deter these countries from continuing this malign practice.""

David Whelan said his brother has been held hostage by the Russian government for nearly 45 months and ""waits in a labor colony for the Russian government to decide if they will accept the concession offered by the U.S. government for his release.""

His brother has been able to speak daily with their parents by phone and told them Friday that he would soon be transferred from the IK-17 prison camp in the Republic of Mordovia to a prison hospital called IK-17.

""Paul did not request the medical attention nor knows what attention he will be receiving"" David Whelan said.

Still he added that his brother is likely to be reassured when he learns that Elizabeth Whelan met with the president ""that his freedom and the freedom of all Americans wrongfully detained by Russia remains a priority for the U.S. government.""

MARLBOROUGH Mass. Sept. 17 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) has announced results from the PROTECTED TAVR clinical trial evaluating the SENTINEL™ Cerebral Protection System which is designed to capture and remove embolic debris stemming from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) before it can reach the brain and potentially cause a stroke. Outcomes were presented during a late-breaking clinical science session at the 34th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in Boston and will be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System.

This randomized trial evaluated periprocedural stroke reduction and neurologic outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis treated with either the SENTINEL device to provide cerebral embolic protection (CEP) during TAVR or TAVR alone. The primary endpoint was not met as the data demonstrated a non-significant trend towards a lower rate of stroke in patients treated with the SENTINEL device representing a 21% relative risk reduction in all stroke through 72 hours or time of hospital discharge (2.3% with TAVR and CEP vs. 2.9% with TAVR only P=0.30). Importantly a secondary analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 60% relative risk reduction in disabling stroke through 72 hours or time of hospital discharge in patients treated with the SENTINEL device (0.5% with TAVR and CEP vs. 1.3% with TAVR only P=0.02).

""Data from the PROTECTED TAVR trial provide the physician community with evidence that the device plays an important role in reducing disabling strokes across patient types in those undergoing TAVR"" said Dr. Samir Kapadia chairman of the Robert and Suzanne Tomsich Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute Cleveland Clinic. ""We also found that the rate of vascular complications in this trial was very low whether or not the device was used highlighting the safety of this technology in TAVR procedures.""

While outcomes with TAVR for the treatment of aortic stenosis have been shown to be comparable to surgery stroke remains an important and feared complication of the procedure. Representing the largest randomized TAVR trial to date the study enrolled 3000 patients spanning more than 50 global sites and all surgical risk levels with all patients receiving a neurological exam before and after the procedure. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the reduction in disabling stroke with the SENTINEL device was consistent across patient subgroups including age gender operative risk valve type and history of cardiovascular disease.

""Considering strokes are unpredictable can occur regardless of an individual's clinical background and often take a great toll on a patient's quality-of-life and financial stability we believe the data appear to demonstrate a consistent effect from CEP technology across all patient populations in the trial – supporting the use of the SENTINEL device as an effective therapy to reduce the risk of the most debilitating form of stroke for patients undergoing TAVR"" said Dr. Ian Meredith global chief medical officer Boston Scientific. ""We look forward to additional data on this technology such as from the currently enrolling PROTECT TAVI trial in the United Kingdom which will similarly evaluate TAVR-related stroke reduction using the SENTINEL device.""

Previous clinical trials involving more than 3500 patients have demonstrated that the SENTINEL device is safe and effective including capture and removal of cerebral embolic debris in 99% of TAVR cases.1 To date more than 75000 patients worldwide have been protected with this technology.

Device-related factors and all-cause death represented categories favoring Amplatzer Amulet against Watchman according to a news release.

Abbott designed its Amplatzer Amulet left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder with dual-seal technology. It features a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to close off the opening into the LAA. The company said it is the first and only minimally invasive treatment option to offer immediate and complete dual-sealing closure of the LAA. It reduces the risk of stroke and eliminates the need for blood-thinning medication.

The prospective international multi-center Amulet IDE trial is the largest randomized LAA occlusion study to date Abbott said. It included more than 1800 patients.

Abbott reported three-year outcomes demonstrating that device-related thrombosis or peri-device leak more frequently preceded strokes in patients with Watchman compared to those with Amulet. Additionally the company said that cardiovascular and all-cause death trended higher in the Watchman device than the Amulet device.

Data from last year’s TCT demonstrated that Boston Scientific’s next-generation Watchman FLX stroke prevention device outperformed the Amulet device. Findings from the SEAL FLX single-center retrospective study of 300 Danish patients found that Watchman FLX demonstrated superiority in the area of LAA closure and peri-device leak.

More Amulet data

Abbott also presented data from its PREDICT-LAA trial. The prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial evaluated the planning process of Amplatzer amulet procedures.

The study looked at the use of cardiac computed tomography-based computational models — high-resolution heart scans generated by FEops HEARTguide. It evaluated if those scans help in the planning of Amplatzer Amulet procedures.

Results demonstrated improved procedural efficiency and safety outcomes associated with HEARTguide planning.

Abbott TriClip performs well

Abbott presented the first results from the TRILUMINATE pivotal trial at TCT 2022. It is the company’s first randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of TEER with TriClip. The study evaluated 700 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Patients spanned the U.S. Canada and Europe.

Results from the roll-in cohort through 30 days demonstrated high implant success rate of 99%. The study also observed at least a one-grade TR reduction in 91% of patients. Additionally 74% of patients achieved moderate or less residual TR.

Patients achieved around a 17-point improvement on the KCCQ score. The 30% improvement from baseline demonstrates a “substantial improvement” in quality of life.

More to come

Abbott is presenting data from its CONFIDENCE Registry on Sunday. The international prospective real-world study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Portico TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation).

The study used the first-generation Portico delivery system in 501 patients and the second-generation FlexNav system in 500 patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Byb3RlY3RlZC10YXZyLW5vLWxlc3Mtc3Ryb2tlLWVtYm9saWMtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi1zb21lLXNlZS1ob3Bl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROTECTED TAVR: No Less Stroke With Embolic Protection but Some See Hope,"There were fewer disabling strokes with protection and the procedure itself was safe so it’s not the end of the story.

BOSTON MA—Those who were hoping that PROTECTED TAVR would provide a clear-cut result and bring closure to the question of whether cerebral embolic protection (CEP) reduces stroke in patients undergoing TAVI were disappointed Saturday when the findings were presented here at TCT 2022.

The trial missed its primary endpoint failing to demonstrate a significant difference in the rate of stroke within 72 hours of the procedure or before discharge—2.3% with use of the Sentinel cerebral protection system (Boston Scientific) versus 2.9% without (P = 0.30).

But that’s not the end of the story according to Samir Kapadia MD (Cleveland Clinic OH) global principal investigator because with embolic protection there was a lower rate of disabling stroke a secondary endpoint for which the trial was not powered (0.5% vs 1.3%; P = 0.02).

He told TCTMD the trial also showed that use of embolic protection was safe with no major complications and that stroke was an unpredictable event—no specific factors that could be used to identify a patient group most likely to benefit from protection emerged.

“I wouldn’t say it’s negative” Kapadia said about the trial adding that it’s possible a larger study could have shown a significant advantage for protection on the primary endpoint. Moreover he added disabling stroke is a more meaningful outcome for patients. “This is in my opinion a positive trial not a negative trial.”

He concluded that use of protection with the Sentinel device (Boston Scientific) should be considered for all patients undergoing TAVI as a way to reduce disabling strokes. The number needed to treat for this purpose was 125.

I don’t think we can completely discount and call this a negative trial because disabling strokes are important and [are] associated with significant disability and morbidity and mortality. Sachin Goel

The results were published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine; along with an accompanying editorial by John Carroll MD (University of Colorado School of Medicine Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora) and Jeffrey Saver MD (David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA Los Angeles) that provides a more-sobering assessment of the trial.

“As a whole this trial strikes a serious blow to the hope that this first CEP device would have a definitive effect in the prevention of TAVR-related strokes” they write. “The ‘smoking gun’ of captured debris was not associated with high-quality evidence of stroke prevention. The safety of the device and its possible effect on disabling strokes provide a ray of hope but the concern persists that CEP approved and marketed on the basis of surrogate outcomes may not actually provide a clear and incontestable clinical benefit.”

PROTECTED TAVR is one of the most eagerly awaited RCTs—and the largest—in structural interventions Sachin Goel MD (Houston Methodist TX) commented to TCTMD.

Two important findings from the trial are that use of the Sentinel system was safe and feasible—with the proportion of patients in whom the filter couldn’t be placed similar to what’s seen in practice—and that disabling strokes were reduced Goel said. He acknowledged that the primary endpoint was missed but said “I don’t think we can completely discount and call this a negative trial because disabling strokes are important and [are] associated with significant disability and morbidity and mortality.”

The safety information is particularly noteworthy Goel said because there had been concerns that the manipulations necessary to get the Sentinel filter in the proper position could actually increase the risk of stroke. “I think this is very reassuring that we haven’t seen an increase in the risk of stroke with this device” he added.

Uptake of the Sentinel system has been spotty since the US Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2017 on the basis of the Sentinel IDE trial. That study showed that debris was captured by the filter in nearly all patients although it also missed its primary endpoint by failing to show a reduction in the volume of new cerebral lesions on MRI.

Whether the PROTECTED TAVR results will actually change how cerebral embolic protection is used out in practice—where there are some strong believers in its benefits and others who are more cautious—and whether TAVI programs will take on the added cost of embolic protection without clear evidence of a clinical benefit remains to be seen.

Megan Coylewright MD (Erlanger Health System Chattanooga TN) editor of the American College of Cardiology’s CardioSmart said “We were hoping there would be a very clear message that stroke was reduced with cerebral protection and the results show that there is no difference in stroke between control and cerebral protection. And typically in studies we stop there and we are curious about the subgroup analysis but we take the finding that the study was powered for as a way to guide clinical practice.” She noted that the trial was not powered to detect a difference in disabling stroke.

For his part Goel thought there would be some impact. “I’m not sure that all nonbelievers will start believing in this and start using this but I think there will be more believers now than nonbelievers perhaps and the shift will be towards using more cerebral embolic protection” he predicted.

Discussion during a press conference reflected uncertainty about the clinical impact of the trial.

Michael Young MD (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Hanover NH) said that his group does not universally use embolic protection during TAVI. This trial supports the safety and feasibility of using the Sentinel as well as a reduction in disabling stroke he said.

He added however that the trial “muddies the water somewhat for programs that are low-to-medium volume” pointing to the number needed to treat to reduce disabling stroke. “I think it’s going to be a tough sell for some of those programs to ubiquitously use that for all their patients.”

Still patient preference may affect use he suggested. “Patients are savvy and they do their research and I’ve had a number of patients asking ‘Do you use cerebral embolic protection?’” he said. “And I think this may potentially change the equation and how people think about it.”

And it’s not just patient preference that could influence adoption of embolic protection. At the main presentation of the results several physician panelists responded to a question about whether they would opt for embolic protection if a loved one were undergoing TAVI. Of the seven only one responded no noting that at her center in Montreal Canada protection is not currently used in any patients.

PROTECTED TAVR

Stroke has been a feared complication of TAVI from the beginning and remains so despite substantial reductions in risk over time. One study using data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry showed that early postprocedural stroke was associated with a substantially higher risk of 30-day mortality (16.7% vs 3.7%) and a reduced likelihood of being discharged home (36.1% vs 78.9%).

The Sentinel cerebral protection system was developed as a way to capture debris created by the TAVI procedure to prevent it from embolizing to the brain. Though the Sentinel IDE trial missed its primary endpoint a post hoc analysis suggested that there was a lower rate of stroke in the 72 hours after the procedure in the protection group (3.0% vs 8.2%) providing the impetus to perform the PROTECTED TAVR trial.

PROTECTED TAVR conducted across 51 centers in Australia Europe North America enrolled 3000 patients (mean age 79 years; 40% women) who were undergoing TAVI and randomized them to use of the Sentinel protection system or not. Patients at all levels of surgical risk were included with an average STS score of 3.3% in the protection arm and 3.4% in the control arm. Neurology professionals examined all patients before and after TAVI.

Overall the Sentinel system was successfully deployed in 94.4% of patients in whom an attempt was made.

The primary endpoint of stroke shortly after the procedure was based on NeuroARC definitions. Most of the strokes recorded were ischemic both in the disabling and nondisabling categories. There was a lower rate of disabling strokes in the protection arm but that difference was not seen for nondisabling strokes (1.7% vs 1.5%; P = 0.67).

Of the eight disabling strokes in the embolic protection arm two were hemorrhagic and would not have been prevented by the Sentinel device. Only one an ischemic stroke in the left MCA territory occurred in what should have been a protected vessel.

There were no differences between the Sentinel and control groups in terms of several other outcomes including all-cause mortality/stroke (2.7% vs 3.0%) mortality (0.5% vs 0.3%) stroke/TIA/delirium (3.1% vs 3.7%) or acute kidney injury (0.5% in each arm). Only one patient had a vascular complication at the access site for the protection system.

Subgroup analyses showed consistency in the lack of difference between trial arms in terms of all strokes and in the lower risk of disabling stroke with cerebral embolic protection.

What Will Change?

PROTECTED TAVR is likely to fuel a debate about how extensively cerebral embolic protection should be deployed in practice.

I think it’s going to be a tough sell for some of those programs to ubiquitously use [the Sentinel] for all their patients. Michael Young

The problem with stroke after TAVI Goel said is that there aren’t any good predictors of who’s going to be affected. At his center the Sentinel device has been used in a minority of cases reserved for those with prior stroke or a bicuspid aortic valve as well as those undergoing a valve-in-valve procedure.

Goel noted that there is another similar trial—BHF PROTECT-TAVI with a projected enrollment of 7000 patients—still ongoing; a meta-analysis combining the results of that trial with those from PROTECTED TAVR is already planned. In addition there are other devices in the pipeline that may provide broader protection against stroke during TAVI.

Based on the results Goel said he will consider using embolic protection more frequently during TAVI and will discuss these data with patients when making a decision about TAVI.

Coylewright said the focus on disabling stroke by the PROTECTED TAVR investigators reminded her of the story around left atrial appendage occlusion where trial evidence indicated a reduction in disabling strokes versus oral anticoagulation. “We want to lean into the outcome of disabling stroke because it shows a difference and because we believe that it is important to our patients” she said. “The study was not powered for that though. Thus it makes it difficult to interpret the result showing less disabling stroke as a means to change our clinical practice.”

Coylewright highlighted the role patients themselves will play in determining how extensively embolic protection is used moving forward: “I think one of the things that is needed is further engagement with patients undergoing TAVR to help us understand how critical this all-stroke outcome is to them versus disabling stroke in order to further understand how to deploy the therapy.”

Though there didn’t seem to be a signal of risk associated with use of the Sentinel system Coylewright said “there are many other things that heart teams will be considering which includes the additional access point during the procedure time spent during the procedure and cost to the patient and the hospital and the health system.”

As for how the PROTECTED TAVR results would shift use of embolic protection out in practice Coylewright couldn’t predict but she said once a study is published the decision to change practice on the basis of the results is based partly on the science and partly on the discussions that are sparked locally and nationally. In this case each heart team will have to review the results have a detailed discussion and make a decision about whether to change practice she said.

Commenting during a panel discussion at the press conference Robert Cubeddu MD (NCH Heart Institute Naples FL) said “a lot of this just boils down to cost and we need to be realistic about that.” He pointed out that many programs across the country are operating on tight margins: “Cost-effectiveness is something we always look at in everything we do in medicine so I’d like to see how perhaps [the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] will stand on this.”

Cubeddu indicated the embolic protection will continue to be used however. “It takes 5 minutes to do the procedure. We’ve seen that it’s safe and technically feasible in over 94% 95% of patients. And if you’re able to prevent one disabling stroke out of 125 and you’re that one patient I think we would all love to benefit from this” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmNsZXZlbGFuZGNsaW5pYy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9jbGV2ZWxhbmQtY2xpbmljLWxlZC10cmlhbC1maW5kcy10aGF0LWNlcmVicmFsLWVtYm9saWMtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi1kZXZpY2UtcmVkdWNlZC1yaXNrLW9mLWRpc2FibGluZy1zdHJva2UtZm9sbG93aW5nLXRhdnItcHJvY2VkdXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Clinic-Led Trial Finds That Cerebral Embolic Protection Device Reduced Risk of Disabling Stroke Following ...,"Findings from a Cleveland Clinic-led trial show that a Cerebral Embolic Protection (CEP) device reduced the risk of disabling strokes by capturing and removing tiny pieces of calcium and other fragments resulting from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) before they can reach the brain.

Findings from the “Cerebral Embolic Protection During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The PROTECTED TAVR Study” were presented today during a late-breaking clinical science session at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference and simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

In the trial the largest randomized TAVR trial to date researchers evaluated stroke reduction during or right after the procedure and neurologic outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis treated with either the CEP device to provide cerebral embolic protection during TAVR or TAVR alone. While the data showed a 21% relative risk reduction in strokes at 72 hours or at time of hospital discharge (whichever came first) the overall numbers of stroke were small and the reduction was not statistically significant enough to meet the all-stroke primary endpoint (2.3% with TAVR and CEP vs. 2.9% with TAVR only P=0.30).

However a secondary analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 60% relative risk reduction in disabling stroke through 72 hours or time of hospital discharge in patients treated with the CEP device (0.5% with TAVR and CEP vs. 1.3% with TAVR only P=0.02).

“In the practice of TAVR an important question for physicians and patients is risk of stroke” said Samir Kapadia M.D. chairman of Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic and the study’s lead author. “This trial informs the doctor that the disabling stoke was reduced by the use of the CEP device and the device is safe to use.”

TAVR is an established treatment for patients with aortic stenosis which is the narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart and can lead to interferences in normal blood flow. TAVR is a minimally invasive procedure in which the aortic valve is replaced with a catheter.

Embolization of debris from the valve can cause a stroke during or right after the procedure leading to increased injury or death. Stroke continues to be an important complication of TAVR with 16.7% mortality at 30 days and remains a top concern for patients.

Although stroke is largely unpredictable the risk is primarily procedural with the vast majority resulting from embolic material released at the time of the valve implantation procedure.

In the PROTECTED TAVR trial a total of 3000 patients were enrolled and randomized between February 2020 and January 2022 at 51 centers in North America Europe and Australia with all patients receiving a neurological exam before and after the procedure.

Disabling stroke occurred in 8 of 1501 (0.5%) patients in the CEP group and 20 of 1499 (1.3%) in the control arm. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the reduction in disabling stroke with the CEP device was consistent across patient subgroups including age gender operative risk valve type and history of cardiovascular disease.

Vascular complications at the CEP access site were minimal — one patient (0.1%) experienced major bleeding at the radial access site in the wrist during catheter removal.

“This study provides data from the largest randomized CEP trial with a clinical stroke endpoint that is relevant to healthcare providers and patients” said Dr. Kapadia. “Although stroke risk is decreasing with newer generation devices and is comparable to surgical aortic valve replacement it remains an important and troubling complication of TAVR.”

Every now and then thanks to their expertise and persistence they achieve a eureka moment. Suddenly triumphantly our researchers understand something no one has ever understood before.

It's my privilege to lead Research and Early Development at Bristol Myers Squibb. In this role I oversee programs and technologies that drive our organization across all therapeutic categories from the “aha” of discovery through the rigors of proof-of-concept. The best part of my job is getting to work with some of the brightest innovators in our industry — each of whom is committed to bringing medicines to patients with unmet medical needs.

Nothing is more important to any of us. And when it comes to bringing our A-game every day nothing motivates us more than knowing that the research carried out in our labs can improve patient health and lead to a higher quality of life and even extended longevity. As scientists it doesn’t get any better than knowing our roles have the potential to transform lives.

But that takes some doing. At the outset the discovery of drugs calls for applying scientific disciplines such as biology chemistry and pharmacology. My ongoing challenge in leading research and early development is to make sure that our researchers have the right resources — and equally valuable the creative freedom and support — to keep our pipeline thriving.

Working together for patients

Building a strong pipeline and winning for patients is a team sport every time. I’m often reminded of the Olympic motto Citius Altius Fortius which translates to ‘faster higher stronger.’ Our aspiration for ourselves and our patients is no different.

To be successful we must focus on discovering developing and delivering medicines to patients faster. It is not enough to be innovative; we must also embrace new ways to accelerate the overall R&D process.

Our sense of urgency drives us to be persistent in the face of scientific challenges and complexity and to seek new approaches to innovation.

Applying computer science. Introducing advanced solutions to our clinical trials. Building testing and deploying robust digital platforms that can achieve scale as sustainably as possible. New datasets that amplify our predictive power through all stages of our pipeline.

The combined power of these tools helps us deliver for patients.

The next big leap

Our pipeline is now more promising and diverse than ever. It’s currently flowing with more than 50 compounds in development across 40 disease classes. It’s no coincidence either that our efforts to incorporate diverse perspectives into the discovery of new medicines has made a big difference here.

We’ve brought together leading researchers in the pharmaceutical industry hailing from a wide range of backgrounds and cultures all of whom are passionate about science and profoundly compassionate toward patients. We’ve also educated inspired and hired a new generation of physicians and scientists from historically underrepresented communities to narrow the dangerous gaps in care facing those underserved populations. Only when our scientific workforce reflects the patient populations we serve after all can we truly unleash our potential to achieve the company’s mission.

I’m proud of these accomplishments. But of course our work is never done.

(Karla Parra/U.S. Air Force)

An exhaustive study four years in the making has found nearly a 40% higher rate of veteran suicides than that reported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The study’s interim report based on service records from the Defense Department and death records from eight states examined suicides and “self-injury mortality” — or deaths classified as accidental or undetermined — in people aged 18 to 64 from 2014 to 2018.

America’s Warrior Partnership a suicide prevention group contracted with the University of Alabama and partnered with Duke University to gather state-provided death data and coordinate with the DOD to corroborate military affiliation. It was funded by the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation.

The study identified a 37% greater suicide rate than reported by the VA. That was because “Operation Deep Dive” as the study is called worked to get specificity of the decedent’s demographics military experience and death details.

The VA by contrast gets its suicide numbers reported by the county authorities where the death occurred. The study found that method failed to identify veterans about 18% of the time.

“It’s not the VA’s fault. The issue is the counties” said Jim Lorraine an Air Force veteran and president of America’s Warrior Partnership.

The VA did not return phone calls or an email for comment.

The states that provided death information for the study were Alabama Florida Maine Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Montana and Oregon.

If the eight states represented a national rate study authors said approximately 24 veterans die each day by suicide as determined by a coroner or medical examiner compared to the VA’s average of 17.7 veteran suicides per day.

In addition some 20 former service members die each day by self-injury mortality — listed as accidents or an undetermined cause of death. More than 80% of those were overdose deaths Lorraine said.

The study identified that veterans most at risk of suicide were those who served for less than three years had been demoted and lived alone in a suburban or rural area.

The study will continue for another four years Lorraine said with plans to get data from more states and drill down into the specifics of each suicide with the ultimate goal of creating prevention tools Lorraine said.

“We’ve got to get those numbers down” Lorraine said."

On Counsell’s watch the Milwaukee Brewers developed All-Star pitchers without drafting them at the top of the first round or fast-tracking them into the major-league rotation. Brown’s curiosity and studious approach to the game led him down this path.

“I had gone into a deep Corbin Burnes dive last year when I was struggling” Brown said. “This was right in the middle of it. This was me struggling in Triple A and then getting hurt. I can tell you about a lot of guys who had bounce-back years.”

Brown laughed and continued: “I did the same thing when I had Tommy John. I can probably rattle off every dude who had TJ in all of North America.”

Brown’s Tommy John surgery cost him most of the 2019 season but he popped up as a prospect in the summer of 2022 when the Philadelphia Phillies traded him for veteran reliever David Robertson. By this time last year Brown had already earned a promotion from Double-A Tennessee and submitted two lights-out starts for the Iowa Cubs. The phone call every player dreams about did not happen.

Opening Day rolled around this season and Brown was still waiting. And then Justin Steele dropped to the ground with a strained left hamstring in the fifth inning of Game 1 making Brown the next man up. Brown 24 struggled in his major-league debut before quickly settling into a hybrid role that took him off the roster bubble.

Brown’s value could be seen in Friday’s 7-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates as he replaced starter Javier Assad and threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings that featured six strikeouts against one walk. Managing Brown’s workload — he threw fewer than 100 innings last year — is a bigger issue than determining whether he belongs.

Brown’s future could be in the rotation — the 6-foot-6 210-pound right-hander certainly looks the part — and the Cubs will keep open that possibility. His heavy fastball/curveball combination has also led reporters to ask Counsell whether Brown could emerge as the team’s closer.

“Ben’s best asset right now is he throws really hard” Counsell said. “Without being too analytical it’s just the hitters’ reaction. He’s beating hitters with the fastball. That’s not easy to do in the big leagues. No matter what your velocity is it’s just not easy to do. He’s beating hitters with the fastball and that makes you cheat. And that makes his off-speed very good. That’s kind of his formula.”

Counsell’s formula for small-market success included more than just Burnes and Woodruff. They were never regarded as generational pitching prospects like Paul Skenes the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft who debuted Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park. Woodruff was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs seven times between July 2017 and July 2018 an example of the roster management that showed Counsell’s dexterity during Milwaukee’s rise.

“He has an excellent track record” Brown said mentioning Josh Hader Devin Williams and Freddy Peralta by name. “There are some really good arms that Craig really helped develop.”

As a rookie in 2018 Burnes went 7-0 with a 2.61 ERA in 30 appearances out of the bullpen a midseason boost that helped the Brewers force a Game 163 at Wrigley Field and take away a division title from the Cubs. Burnes split the next season between the majors (8.82 ERA) and Triple-A San Antonio (8.46 ERA). His name then appeared in the Cy Young Award voting in each of the next four years and he won the award in 2021.

Progress as Cubs executives like to say isn’t always linear. Brown spent a month-plus on the injured list with a strained left oblique and finished last season working out of Iowa’s bullpen. He needed those reminders when his development stalled.

“Corbin Burnes went through that one funky year before he ended (up) going off for a Cy Young ride” Brown said. “Woodruff was a little bit of a late bloomer as well. There’s the (Jacob) deGroms of the world who didn’t debut until he was (almost) 26. Last year with my frustration I was like ‘Hey there’s still hope for me to be a good baseball player one day.’”

Brown’s self-awareness and dedication to his craft should help him continue to make adjustments. He has a 2.84 ERA in four starts and four multi-inning appearances as a reliever. His fastball velocity (96.5 mph) is elite. His strikeout rate (25.8 percent) is above average on a staff that doesn’t have that much classic swing-and-miss stuff.

Brown’s personality traits will also likely keep him in Counsell’s circle of trust. It’s not like the Cubs are going to suddenly get healthy. Before Saturday’s game in Pittsburgh the team placed reliever Yency Almonte on the 15-day injured list with a strained right shoulder and recalled right-hander José Cuas from Iowa. Whatever Counsell needs Brown will be available.

“It’s all good” Brown said. “Put in the time. Put in the work. And try not to worry too much about going down or whatever. It’s been awesome.”

Actress Yvette Nicole Brown 52 and her fiancé Anthony Davis found love with each other when they weren’t looking. The couple who announced their engagement in December 2023 discussed their relationship and upcoming wedding on Getting Grilled with Curtis Stone. During the interview Brown encouraged women who are waiting for partners not to settle.

“To be my age to be single as long as I was single and to have waited — you know I didn’t just grab a guy I waited until I found the guy my heart loves that’s a testimony and that’s also aspirational and inspirational to women that are in my position” Brown told Stone during their chat.

She continued “I would love for a 40-something or a 50-something woman to see this story and go ‘Okay it’s right for me to wait for the right one or to not just marry whoever asks me first if I don’t feel it.’ It is still possible.”

While the actress is open to sharing her story she still wants to be intentional about retaining a level of privacy.

“So now I’m trying to thread the needle about how much do I share to encourage people without giving away what is special and important to me?” Brown asked.

The couple met initially when they were in their 20s while in an acting class at church and reconnected in recent years. Brown said she wasn’t actively looking for love but clearly love was looking for her. They were platonic friends and then things blossomed organically according to the actress.

“In life sometimes things happen and you think ‘Okay I’m done with dating. I’m not gonna deal with this anymore’ and then in comes somebody who’s pumping your heart helping you breathe and you don’t even realize it” she said.

During the interview Davis said friendship continues to be the foundation of their loving relationship. When they pivoted to talks about their upcoming wedding Brown admitted that she no longer fantasizes about an idyllic white wedding. Therefore she’s going into wedding planning a bit blind.

“I’m of a certain age and had stopped dreaming of weddings and you know I’m not one of those girls who has a vision board of ‘This is my dress.’ I did that in my 20s it didn’t happen. I was done” she said. “It’s been 30 years since I dreamed about a wedding or where I was gonna hold it or whatever so I’m clueless.”

Davis is similarly not stressing about the wedding and said he’d marry Brown whether it be “at the justice of the peace” or a fancy “vineyard.” He had one catch however when it came to the bride.

“It has to be you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starving brown pelicans overwhelm bird rescue facility in Fairfield,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023953005D20>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Simmons College of Kentucky is bringing a piece of Louisville history back to life.

The school dedicated the old Central High School near the Limerick neighborhood on Thursday.

Simmons said it will now become the Ida B. Wells Hall named after the prominent journalist and early civil rights activist.

The building itself holds historical significance.

It was dedicated in 1873 and was the first locally and publicly funded school for African Americans. Many regarded the location as the “birthplace of Black public education in Kentucky” and one of the most progressive high schools for African Americans. It was also the only high school in Louisville for African American students.

""They said yes African Americans need to be trained with their hands but also with their minds and they wanted to train leaders and intellectuals"" George Wright University of Kentucky vice president for Institutional Diversity said.

Simmons hopes the building will now be returned to its status as a hub for Black education in Louisville and a key to a brighter future.

View the current offers here.

One of the greatest things about credit cards is that some give you statement credits to make the things you enjoy free. That includes perks like Global Entry Uber rides and streaming services.

But one of the greatest frustrations is keeping track of these statement credits to make sure they post correctly giving you the rebate that you deserve.

American Express offers the most statement credits out of any major issuer. Given how many you may have at your disposal keeping track of them can be difficult. That's why we have a monthly checklist of credit card perks you should be using.

But what happens if these credits don't post properly? Here's how you can claim missing statement credits from Amex.

Make sure you qualify for the statement credit

Before assuming that a statement credit is missing make sure you are eligible for that credit first. Many statement credits from American Express require enrolling for the benefit in advance. Thus if you didn't enroll for the benefit prior to making a purchase you might be surprised to find out that you aren't eligible for a statement credit.

BUSAKORN PONGPARNIT/GETTY IMAGES

Here's a look at some benefits you must enroll for in advance in order to receive statement credits from Amex:

Thus if you make a purchase with one of these merchants you may not receive the statement credit you are expecting if you didn't enroll for the benefit in advance.

How to claim your missing Amex statement credits

Before contacting Amex make sure you have the information on the merchant the purchase amount and what day it posted to your account. To find these details log in to your American Express account online or via the app.

Next navigate to the card that the purchase was charged to and open the ""Statements & Activity"" page. Then scroll down until you find the relevant charge the date and the amount. And then look through all other charges in that same month to see if you received the statement credit associated with your purchase.

If you are certain you're eligible for a statement credit and have waited a sufficient amount of time here's how you can claim your missing credits from American Express.

Related: How long does it take to receive statement credits from Amex Capital One and Chase?

For contacting Amex there are two options: You can use the online chat feature or call the number on the back of your card.

In March it took 12 days to receive my Walmart+ credit but I received the credit on the very same day in June. AMERICANEXPRESS.COM

Once you are speaking to a customer service representative mention that you have missing statement credits and identify exactly which benefit they are related to. From here mention the date of the charge for which you didn't receive the appropriate credits.

AMERICANEXPRESS.COM

In both July and August I didn't receive statement credits for my Walmart+ membership which is a benefit of The Platinum Card® from American Express. This was apparently a wider issue as reported by Doctor of Credit. However the chat representative said billing should be fixed from September 2022. My chat session to resolve the missing credits took less than five minutes from start to end. Enrollment required.

Related: How 5 minutes of chat got me 85000 points plus $150

If you decide to call the conversation model will be the same. Explain which credits are missing and the date of the relevant charge then request the credit from the employee you are talking to.

Most likely one of two things will happen during your conversation. It's possible the customer service agent will tell you to wait longer before they can manually post the credit for you. If that happens ask how much longer you should wait for the statement credit to post to your account before you contact Amex again for further help.

It's also possible that the representative will post courtesy credits to your account while talking to you. If that happens ask how long you should wait for these to show up.

In either situation make sure you take note of this timeline and ask what you should do next if things don't go as planned. I usually ask ""If the credits don't show up by then what should I do?""

Bottom line

When technology works as expected life is great. You enroll for a benefit offered by your credit card make the corresponding purchase and then a statement credit posts to your bill a few days later.

Unfortunately it doesn't always work this way. The good news here is that claiming your missing statement credits from Amex isn't overly difficult. The most time-efficient way to get your missing statement credits is to use Amex's online chat function.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZvcmxpdmVtdXNpYy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2lkZXNwcmVhZC1wYW5pYy10aGUtdGhlYXRlci1hdC1tZ20tbmF0aW9uYWwtaGFyYm9yLTktMTYtMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Widespread Panic Threatens To Overtake The Nation's Capital On First Night At MGM National Harbor [Audio/Videos],"Kings of jam rock Widespread Panic set up basecamp at a strategic location that the veterans of the road know well at this point having played there three times in four years. While WSP hunkered down for the weekend at The Theater at MGM National Harbor on the Potomac River just a few clicks downstream of the Washington Monument reinforcements of “Goodpeople” gathered from around the country for Friday night’s jubilee. As is tradition Panic brought the heat and performed nonstop jams with a second set that was as good as they’ve ever played.

Rolling up their sleeves and getting to work after a customary welcome greeting from John Bell (“G’evening everybody!”) the six-piece opened with “Give” for the first time since 2016. Two consecutive transitions connected the first three songs of the set as Dave Schools anchored the melody into a thumpin’ “Bear’s Gone Fishin’” until Jimmy Herring’s solo spilled over into a nasty “Worry”. (“One day I’m gonna get better babe / and take a little time to worry all about you.”)

The band paused to catch its breath but maintained the theme as JB crooned “C. Brown” (“You don’t have to worry…”) like a mother placating an agitated child. Before the song could fade away Duane Trucks revived the beat and introduced “Steven’s Cat”. For the fans who made the trek Jimmy Herring accelerated into the horizon of “Shut Up and Drive” until parking inside the first cover of the night fIREHOSE’s “Sometimes”.

Winding down the set Panic performed “You Got Yours” on the 27th anniversary of the song’s debut. Both Jimmy and JoJo—on organ and piano—had their say before moving on. To finish the first frame JB gnawed into a slice of blues history with a gritty version of Willie Dixon’s “Taildragger”.

Back from set break Panic staggered into the second set with a grooving “From the Cradle” before “Goodpeople” encapsulated JoJo’s “Dark Bar” for another spirited round. After a brief pause Panic charged on without stopping until the end of the set.

A voodoo-infused performance of Dr. John’s “I Walk on Guilded Splinters” blazed the way into an early morning “Diner” run. Following a peaking solo and subsequent breakdown JB served up a tasty improvised rap (“Put a quarter in the jukebox and make it sing this morning before all the respectable people come ’round.”)—sustenance for the soul.

Past the point of no return Panic dug into a heavy “Papa’s Home” until slowing the tempo down for a dreamy “Jamais Vu”. Cranking the intensity back up Bloodkin’s “Henry Parsons Died” evolved into “Conrad” to close the second set and ended over an hour of consecutive jams.

Widespread Panic came back for a pair of encores to finish the show in the same badass style that ran rampant throughout the first two sets.

The Miami Herald reported on the large fracus which took place on the Carnival Sunrise on September 9th. Included in the article titled A massive fight broke out on a Carnival cruise ship. Cellphone cameras caught it all was video featured on Twitter.

The Miami Herald explained that “footage of the nasty bust-up . . . involved a handful of people punching and beating on each other . . . ” The “handful” of people were estimated to be around thirty. The fight occured between the pool and one of the ship’s many bars.

A fight between cruise passengers sailing on the Carnival Sunrise is caught on camera pic.twitter.com/DUyNSKci2J — Parker Branton (@ParkerBranton) September 11 2022

The Daily Mail in the UK covered the cruise ship skirmish and included a TicTok video which showed the begining of the fight. The Sun newspaper included a video with a portion of the violent fight.

Fights on Carnival cruise ships are hardly rare as we have repeatedly reported. The last time a hoard of people began beating each other took place just last June on the Carnival Magic. Sixty 60 passengers were involved in an “all-out brawl” around 5:20 a.m. when the Carnival cruise ship was returning to port in New York following an eight day cruise to the Caribbean. As usual no one was arrested or prosecuted although numerous cell phones caught many dozens of cruise guests in the melee.

We first wrote about the problem of violence on Carnival owned cruise ships back in 2009 in Cruise Ship Brawls – A Problem that Will Get Bigger with Bigger Ships where we covered a “mini-rampage” on the P&O cruise ship Ventura and a brawl involving passengers who punched scratched and bit it out with police in Antigua. The following year we covered another violent brawl on another Carnival ship in More Cruise Ship Violence – A Drunken Brawl On Carnival’s Dream. We also wrote about this problem in Another Brawl Breaks Out on a Carnival Fun Ship. YouTube is filled with videotapes of violence on Carnival ships.

The problem arises when the “wider audience” (a term coined by Carnival chairmen Micky Arison) finds their way onto cruise ships attracted by low prices. Add too much alcohol and too few well-trained security guards on these budget ships and this is what happens. Carnival security guards are often seen kicking or hitting the guests or trying to keep onlookers from videotaping the raucous conduct.

Fowler joined the Navy eight years ago. Today Fowler serves as an aviation electronics technician.

“I joined the Navy to follow a family tradition” said Fowler. “My great uncles were all in the Army Marine Corps and Airforce. My father was in the Navy for 20 years aboard submarines. When it came time for me to serve the Navy seemed like the right fit.”

Growing up in Fredericktown Fowler attended Highland High School and graduated in 2014. Today Fowler relies upon skills and values similar to those found in Fredericktown to succeed in the military.

“I remember being at the county fair in Fredericktown” said Fowler. “A gentleman I’d never seen before or spoken to before knew who I was. That taught me that your legacy and character can go a long way. Someone could always be watching so carry yourself with that knowledge and you can always be proud of the life you lead.”

These lessons have helped Fowler while serving with the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Oceana.

Naval Air Station Oceana serves as the Navy’s East Coast Master Jet Base. The flight line Apollo Soucek Field is home to 17 aviation squadrons and hosts the F/A-18 Super Hornet.

The Super Hornet is one of the most advanced aircraft in the world according to Navy officials. The aircraft takes off from and lands on Navy aircraft carriers at sea and is capable of conducting air-to-air combat as well as striking targets on land.

Navy aircraft carriers are designed for a 50-year service life. When the air wing is embarked the ship carries more than 70 attack fighter jets helicopters and other aircraft all of which take off from and land aboard the carrier at sea. With more than 5000 sailors serving aboard the aircraft carrier is a self-contained mobile airport.

Aircraft carriers are often the first response to a global crisis because of their ability to operate freely in international waters anywhere on the world’s oceans.

Since USS Langley’s commissioning 100 years ago the nation’s aircraft carriers and embarked carrier air wings have projected power sustained sea control bolstered deterrence provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and maintained enduring commitments worldwide.

“The aircraft carrier is our U.S. Navy’s centerpiece our flagship and a constant reminder to the rest of the world of our enduring maritime presence and influence” said Rear Adm. James P. Downey USN Program Executive Officer (PEO) Aircraft Carriers. “These ships touch every part of our Navy’s mission to project power ensure sea control and deter our adversaries.”

Serving in the Navy means Fowler is part of a team that is taking on new importance in America’s focus on strengthening alliances modernizing capabilities increasing capacities and maintaining military readiness in support of the National Defense Strategy.

“The Navy contributes to the National Defense Strategy in many ways” said Fowler. “The Navy consistently provides services around the world. We provide maritime interception operations. If a country needs assistance we can always be there to help. We also provide freedom of navigation of the seas even in contested waters.”

With more than 90 percent of all trade traveling by sea and 95 percent of the world’s international phone and internet traffic carried through fiber optic cables lying on the ocean floor Navy officials continue to emphasize the importance of accelerating America’s advantage at sea.

“Maintaining the world’s best Navy is an investment in the security and prosperity of the United States as well as the stability of our world” said Adm. Mike Gilday Chief of Naval Operations. “The U.S. Navy—forward deployed and integrated with all elements of national power—deters conflict strengthens our alliances and partnerships and guarantees free and open access to the world’s oceans. As the United States responds to the security environment through integrated deterrence our Navy must continue to deploy forward and campaign with a ready capable combat-credible fleet.”

Fowler and the sailors they serve with have many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during their military service.

“My proudest Navy accomplishment is my final checker afloat” said Fowler. “That’s when you get to go up on the flight deck and launch jets. That was the qualification my grandma really wanted me to get before she passed so it’s very important to me.”

As Fowler and other sailors continue to train and perform missions they take pride in serving their country in the United States Navy.

“As a Navy sailor you can be an ambassador for America when overseas” added Fowler. “When other countries think of America they remember the good work done by the Navy. That’s why I feel a lot of pride when I put on my uniform and serve.”

Carrier Corporation is one of the largest and has a presence in over one hundred countries. You can also choose from Daikin Mitsubishi or York. Some of these brands also make unitary products. In addition to these major companies you can find locally-owned air conditioning companies.

Carrier Corporation

Carrier Corporation is a multinational corporation that manufactures heating and air conditioning equipment refrigeration systems and fire and security equipment. Founded in 1895 the company is known worldwide for its quality products. Its products are used in residential and commercial buildings. Its products are designed to improve comfort and efficiency in the home and office as well as in commercial spaces.

In 1990 the company was still privately owned but it became a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC). UTC is an aerospace giant known for its Pratt & Whitney jet engine division. UTC has a global footprint including Carrier. Its Building Systems division which includes the company’s sister company Otis Elevator Company accounted for 38 percent of UTC’s revenue in 1991. Today Carrier is a leading HVAC manufacturer with distribution channels in 118 countries.

York International Corp.

York International is an American conglomerate that makes luxury air-conditioning equipment. In 1981 the company was the second-largest air-conditioning maker in the United States. The company also acquired the air-conditioning division of Westinghouse Electric Corp. and in 1985 it considered selling it. In 1984 the company reported an operating profit of $6.5 million but it also had a debt of $60 million about 17 percent of Borg-Warner’s total. In 1985 York had a loss of $1.2 million and it owed Borg-Warner an additional $60 million.

The company also manufactures air-conditioning heating and refrigeration systems. Its products are used in residential commercial and industrial applications. The company currently has an office in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania but it will expand its business in the Northeast with the help of York International. In addition to its own sales and service operations the company has several joint ventures and alliances.

Daikin

Daikin is a leading Japanese air conditioning company with a history that dates back to 1897. As a manufacturer of luxury air conditioning and refrigeration equipment the company has developed a range of ancillary businesses. It has a successful chemical division that specializes in the manufacture of fluorocarbon gases the basic ingredient of air conditioning coolants. Daikin has also expanded into the manufacturing of oil hydraulic pumps. It has also taken on a broader role in the defense industry providing equipment and explosives to Japan’s Defense Ministry.

The company began an overseas expansion program in the early 1970s. It initially focused on Japan and its neighbors along the Pacific Rim. The continued success of the company encouraged it to expand into the European market where it set up Daikin Europe N.V. in 1971. This made Daikin the first Japanese air conditioning company to establish a base outside of Japan. It has remained a leader in the industry ever since.

Mitsubishi

Mitsubishi is an electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing company based in Japan. The company was founded in 1921 and is one of the core companies of Mitsubishi Electric. Since then it has grown to be one of the world’s most trusted brands in air conditioning systems. Listed below are some of the core companies of Mitsubishi.

After the company was founded it became a multinational corporation and acquired many other companies and products to grow its business. During this period the company suffered several losses but the company managed to recover and has been growing ever since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9pLXRyYXZlbGVkLXVzaW5nLWFuLWVzaW0tZm9yLW15LWlwaG9uZS1hbmQtaGVyZXMtd2h5LXlvdS1zaG91bGQtdG9v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I traveled using an eSIM for my iPhone — and here's why you should too,"The freedom to be able to take your phone all over the world and not pop in another physical SIM card to stay tethered to the world is unparalleled. Thanks to eSIMs this reality has been around since 2017 on smartphones — but I only just discovered the joy of getting an eSIM connection on my iPhone when I recently traveled to Europe from the US.

I have always faithfully relied on a good old physical SIM card for all my travels up until now. Enabling a physical SIM seemed easy enough and I always carry a little pouch to store my original SIM so I don’t lose it. Simple I thought.

But after my experience with eSIMs on my iPhone I don’t think I can ever go back to a regular SIM card while traveling.

For the uninitiated eSIM — that's short for embedded subscriber identity module — is basically a digital version of the SIM card which can be downloaded on a compatible phone and saves you the hassle of popping out the SIM card tray and popping in a tiny SIM card.

Most recent phones be they iPhone or Android device come with eSIM compatibility.

Traveling with an eSIM

Traveling with an eSIM was an easy-breezy affair. I was set to travel to France and Italy and I had my trusty iPhone XR with me.

There’s a nifty app that I discovered for downloading the eSIM on my iPhone XR. (More on the app later.) With a few swishes and taps I was all set for my summer travel. As soon as I switched off airplane mode on my iPhone the eSIM was enabled and I had a strong connection. Bonjour Paris!

eSIM will save you the hassle of popping tiny nano SIM cards in and out on your flight where you risk the possibility of losing the tiny things. It will also save you the stress of landing in a new country and buying one of those touristy SIM cards which can prove to be quite costly in certain countries.

It’s very easy to switch networks with an eSIM and you can have more than one network including having voice and data on different plans. You can usually have up to 5 virtual SIMs depending on the phone you use.

I didn’t need that many. I bought two connections — one each for France and Italy.

eSIM on iPhone

iPhone XR was one of the first iPhones to come enabled with eSIM and using eSIM proved to be a delight. After purchasing my plan I just had to enable everything under Settings > Mobile Data; under ""Data Plans"" I could toggle the plan I wanted to be on or off.

You can also label your plans with different options like ""Business"" or ""Travel"" and then choose which number to use for calls or messages and data too. I custom-labeled mine to know which one to use in which country.

(Image credit: Future)

Now here’s the best part about getting an eSIM on your iPhone — you can opt to make one connection a primary one while turning another connection into your secondary one. This means that you can make calls from one number which will be your default and use the secondary one just for cellular data. This is exactly what I did with texts coming through my primary US number while I used the data from the eSIM I bought.

Using iOS 13 and later you can choose either or both numbers. In fact with iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini you can use Dual SIM with two active eSIMs as well.

(Image credit: Apple)

Dual SIM is there on models before the iPhone 13 family as well but with one nano SIM and one eSIM.

You can also choose to ""Allow cellular data switching"" which will then use cellular data from both plans depending on coverage and availability.

Apple offers eSIM on all their models above iPhone XR and with iOS 12.1 or later. But you cannot use eSIM on an iPhone that is locked to a carrier. (Perhaps a reason to consider one of the best unlocked phones.)

Meet Airalo

Airalo is the app that sprung up the eSIM connection on my iPhone almost instantly. It's a free download on iOS or Android that presents a list of countries and eSIM plans to choose from.

Comparing a basic data plan I found on Airalo with some of the SIM card data plans in Paris I found I had saved around $5 by taking the eSIM 7-day data plan on Airalo (although the SIM card plans did include talk time as well).

Once I purchased the plan on Airalo the app led me step-by-step on how to activate the eSIM. It was through the same steps mentioned above and all I had to do to switch between my France and Italy plan was to tap on ""Turn on this line"" in the settings.

Other apps such as Holafly offer eSim plans too if you prefer to shop around.

Overall I feel this is an underrated technology that is not spoken about enough. The ease of use of eSIMs and travel especially on an iPhone made me a total convert.

In the future all phones might just move to having no physical SIM cards leaving more space for other components such as the battery. For now iOS 16 is all set to make transferring eSIMs very easy just through Bluetooth. Now that the iPhone 14 series is being sold in the US as eSIM-only models here's a detailed guide on how to activate eSIM on your iPhone 14.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mcm9udGllci1haXJsaW5lcy1zcGFjZXgtc3RhcmxpbmstaW5mbGlnaHQtd2lmaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frontier Airlines In Talks With SpaceX Over Starlink Inflight WiFi,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mcm9udGllci1haXJsaW5lcy1zcGFjZXgtc3RhcmxpbmstaW5mbGlnaHQtd2lmaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Chris Chmiel founder of the festival and Athens county commissioner spends his whole year preparing for the weekend-long event.

“For me it's like climbing a mountain every year” said Chmiel. “It’s just like the biggest part of my life really. (It’s) kinda stressful but kinda worth the stress ultimately.”

One of the recent changes to the festival is a transition of fiscal agents. Chmiel said a new non-profit was created for the festival: the Native Foods Education Organization. The current goal of the organization is to keep the festival going; though Chmiel said it could take on new projects in the future.

“Luckily we’re blessed with a really great team” Chmiel said. “We’ve got people who have been with the festival for like fourteen years … I think we’ve got a really solid group.”

Over the years more educational tents have emerged. This year tents included subjects like heritage sustainable living Ohio County Fair holistic health pollinators and of course pawpaws.

The pollinator tent included Wild Ones a group with the aspiration to encourage environmentally-friendly landscaping a plant nursery called Natives in Harmony and Kevin “KC” Clark “the Caterpillar Guy”

Clark wearing a black “Got moths?” t-shirt held four green caterpillars dawdling in the palm of his hand. Clark said his interest in insects was born in 1969 when a neighbor showed him how to raise caterpillars.

“You have to have the right habitat you have to have the right other insects” said Clark. “Those caterpillars depend on ants it’s a mutualistic relationship.”

Now Clark brings caterpillars to different schools and groups to educate children about caterpillars moths and butterflies.

James Hunt from Akron Ohio came to the Pawpaw Festival for his second year. Hunt and his family were encouraged to attend last year’s festival by their neighbors.

“Clean facilities great for the kids slept well” said Hunt. “Fresh air nice activities for the kids inside great music and we love the bubble guy.""

Though Hunt and his family had only attended one Pawpaw Festival previously and they were glad to return.

“We haven’t had a vacation in like four years because of COVID” said Hunt. “This is our only time off and we chose to do this.”

ARTS/West a local Athens arts center often attends Pawpaw Festival but this year for the first time they have something to sell.

Carter Rice program specialist at ARTS/West and self-identified tie-dye aficionado united his love for tie-dye and his work at ARTS/West. With encouragement from his boss Rice started selling clothes he tie-dyed some with an ARTS/West print at the Nelsonville Music Festival.

A new reclaiming aspect of the tie-dye is incorporating acid mine drainage into the dye. The process is similar to normal tie-dye but with the addition of soda ash to brighten the colors.

“All of the things that we're doing are Appalachian-based” said Rice. “The items we have received from UpCycle are all from the region the acid mine drainage is from Appalachia. And I would consider myself an Appalachian artist because I’m from West Virginia.”

This year was Rice’s first Pawpaw Festival. At the Nelsonville Music Festival Rice tried a pawpaw for the first time on a nature walk with TikTok’s “Black Forger” Alexis Nikole Nelson.

“Now that I’ve seen it I probably will always return” said Rice.

is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Boston. He tellsabout wonders in the Himalayas I am a biologist and I can see the Himalayas like most mountains in the world witnessing unprecedented change now. This includes climate impacts and biodiversity decline driven by social and economic factors. Understanding these crises and engaging policy makers and the public to adopt mitigations forms the core of my research. This work is interdisciplinary and involves ATREE the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment which I founded 25 years ago located in the Himalayas and Bengaluru.Flowering pink rhododendrons frame icy Himalayan vistas. Photo courtesy: iStockI’ve researched biodiversity in the Himalayas mapped deforestation and land use changes tracked climate change with satellite imagery studied local perceptions of climate events and initiated projects to diversify agricultural systems which can support biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods. The Himalayas are the highest mountains in the world — and the youngest on Earth. They are 40 million years old compared to the Andes which are 60 million years and the even older Alps. The Himalayas were formed when a piece of a huge land mass called the Indian Plate broke away from the African Plate and began moving northwards colliding with the Asian Plate — this collision resulted in the uplift of these mountains. With their altitudinal and climatic factors they hold a complex topography a vast amount of ice as glaciers and huge biodiversity.: A fire-tailed sunbird which is an important pollinator of rhododendrons sits amidst Rhododendron glaucophyllum. Photo Courtesy: ATREE via K. BawaIndeed about two-thirds of India’s biodiversity is found in the Himalayas. I’ve seen flowering rhododendrons covering the whole mountainside in reds and pinks primulas in the valleys carpeting entire forest floors the efflorescent flowers of the six-foot-tall Sikkim rhubarb found at 15000 feet caterpillar fungus (which is half-fungus half-insect) that occurs above 4000 metres and plant pollination at 5000 metres. At heights where you can barely breathe there are incredible biotic interactions that inspired me to write ‘Himalaya: Mountains of Life’. The diversity of just its plants — over 100 species of rhododendrons are found there — is fascinating. But now we face the loss of this tremendous treasure.This biodiversity evolved over millions of years but is being devastated within a few decades. The Anthropocene is impacting the Himalayas severely in terms of water climate and the richness of life. The Himalayas with their huge ice resources are termed the ‘water tower’ of Asia the source of its largest rivers which support over a billion people. These rivers also carry sediments which flow through the plains providing nutrients and minerals that sustain agriculture in the lowlands. Mountains for millennia a source of spiritual and sacred enrichment prove how we live in an interconnected world — what happens in a faraway Himalayan watershed will affect us all. These ranges confront challenges from population expansion to unplanned construction infrastructure development deforestation new roads and unchecked tourism bearing the gifts of littering.The Himalayas hold over 15 species of the delicate Impatiens plant including the magenta Impatiens glandulifera (Top) and the golden Impatiens stenentha (below). Photos Courtesy: ATREE via K. BawaThese are all impacting natural habitats and exacerbating climate effects. We have to urgently recognise the need for sustainable development where growth conservation and equity are compatible and which can save millions of lives from impending disasters. I owe the Himalayas much as they changed my life. Over 60 years ago as a young graduate student I took a ride in the toy train from Siliguri to Darjeeling. Raised in Punjab with relatively little biodiversity I was amazed as the train began to rise from the foothills. I saw an abundance of life I’d never imagined existed on Earth — almost every tree came from a different species. The slow-moving train would stop frequently and I could see glorious butterflies of many colours hear birds with wondrous diverse calls. I thought I was in a paradise. I would not want to see this paradise lost. The mountains have given us so much. We need to give the Himalayas our love and care now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcmFpbi1tYWcuY29tL2NvbGxpbmEtc3RyYWRhLXNwcmluZy1zdW1tZXItMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collina Strada spring summer 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcmFpbi1tYWcuY29tL2NvbGxpbmEtc3RyYWRhLXNwcmluZy1zdW1tZXItMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395242F4F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Real estate firm CBRE says Canadian hotels will return to pre-pandemic revenues next year two years ahead of its previous forecast.

The firm is projecting the Canadian hotels market will end this year at 92 per cent of the revenue per available room achieved in 2019 before the health crisis began.

It is forecasting moderate revenue growth will continue into 2023 as hotel operators push for higher room rates and projects revenue per available room will hit $107 next year.

Revenue per available room is a measure of a hotel’s performance calculated by multiplying its average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.

The $107 rate CBRE foresees will amount to a 70 per cent increase from the industry’s 2021 performance which was hampered by health and travel restrictions meant to quell COVID-19 cases.

CBRE is also projecting half of the major urban markets in Canada are expected to see a revenue per available room above $100 in 2023 with Vancouver reaching $182 Montreal at $135 and Toronto hitting $129.

“Strong leisure travel and a rapid rebound in the average daily rate in many cities is producing a strong hotel performance. Overnight visits from the U.S. continue to recover along with visitation from other key international markets” said David Ferguson CBRE’s hotels director in a news release.

“However travel from some key markets notably the Asia/Pacific region is still challenged. Cities and hotels that serve corporate travel meetings and group travel face a slower recovery.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiZXJkZWVubGl2ZS5uZXdzL25ld3MvYWJlcmRlZW4tbmV3cy9hYmVyZGVlbi1zZXJ2aWNlLXN0YXRpb24tcmV2YW1wLXN0YXJ0aW5nLTc1OTc4NDDSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmVyZGVlbmxpdmUubmV3cy9uZXdzL2FiZXJkZWVuLW5ld3MvYWJlcmRlZW4tc2VydmljZS1zdGF0aW9uLXJldmFtcC1zdGFydGluZy03NTk3ODQwLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aberdeen service station revamp 'starting to take shape' as grand opening around the corner,"An Aberdeen service station that is currently undergoing refurbishment is underway as progress is ""starting to take shape"".

The service station located on Springfield Road approximately two miles west of Aberdeen city centre has been taken over by leading real estate advisor CBRE on a 20-year lease.

It comprises 3186 sq ft of retail space and has over 30 parking spaces.

CBRE’s Aberdeen office worked in collaboration with the firm’s Roadside and Automotive team to secure Ascona and it will be the group’s first site in Scotland and their 63rd site in the UK.

Derren McRae Head of CBRE Aberdeen previously said: ""We are pleased to announce that Ascona Group has selected Springfield Road service station for its first operation in Scotland with plans to transform the site into a BP filling station and Nisa convenience store.

""The company picked a prime west end location in the city with it benefitting not only from the custom of drivers but also from ‘walk in’ trade from the surrounding popular residential area. The transaction also provided a great opportunity to work together with our specialist colleagues in the Roadside and Automotive team.""

The new petrol station is set to include BP branded fuel a Nisa convenience store Greggs Starbucks Coffee a full range of eat now and take-home groceries chilled snacks and drinks alcohol and more.

Pictures published by Ascona show the station in its final stages of work as the exterior for Nisa and Greggs appear to be almost complete.

It is planned to open on Thursday September 22 but could potentially open the day before depending on the arrival of stock and facilities over the national mourning period.

Further updates on the new petrol station can be found on their Facebook here.

It has been so for many years but the 2022 X1 Carbon Gen10 pushes the limits. It comes with new display options and the Intel Gen12 processors that have a significantly higher core count than last year’s models. Let’s put it to the test!

Configurations

Our unit came with the following specifications: Intel i7-1260P 16GB of RAM 512GB SSD (Samsung MZVL2512HCJQ-00BL7) with a 1900×200 500 NITs touch display with a Windows Hello IR webcam and the ThinkPad Privacy Guard. It costs 2269 at CDW but check Lenovo.com for potential deals.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 configuration is highly flexible and comes in many different variants. The nine CPU options range from the Core i5-1235U (10+8 cores) to the Core i7-1280P (14+8 cores) Intel 12th generation mobile P-series processor. That said all of them are equipped with the Intel Iris Xe Graphics integrated into the CPU.

The primary processor is paired with 8/16/32 GB of LPDDR5-2000 RAM soldered to the motherboard. 16GB should work well for most people and if you need 32GB we’ll trust that you know why. Storage options are 256/512/1024 and 2048GB of SSD over PCIe 4.0 (vs. 3.0 previously).

Fortunately the SSD drive is easily accessible by removing some screws that retain the bottom cover. Users can therefore change/upgrade it easily.

Design

Lenovo has kept the overall ThinkPad X1 Carbon design similar to last year’s. There are changes from the Gen 9 model but the overall theme and chassis are similar enough that you would have difficulty discerning the two from a distance.

The ratio between its weight of 2.48 Lbs (1.12Kh) and the system performance (more on that later) is one of the many reasons the Thinkpad X1 Carbon is so popular. This exceptionally light weight comes from its carbon fiber and magnesium construction.

Less glamorous but just as important Lenovo uses much more recycled materials (including plastic) than before. Even the packaging is made of 90% recycled or sustainable materials.

When paired with its durability (spill-resistant keyboard MIL-STD-810H certification) it has always been a tough act to beat and that’s still true for this 10th generation. And finally if you add the hardware + software security and the physical security (nano-Kensington port multi-layered BIOS security) it’s easy to see why it is a favorite choice for enterprises.

Keyboard / Trackpad

The keyboard has a typical ThinkPad layout (including the Fn key at the lower left) and while the key-travel depth is not as deep as on larger ThinkPads the general feel is familiar and comfortable. Lenovo has been highly consistent with this over the years and we’re tempted to have standalone ThinkPad keyboard reviews as references.

As we said the keyboard is spill-resistant and has two levels of backlighting to keep it readable in dim lighting conditions. This keyboard is also designed to utilize the keys as “air intake” to cool the computer. It’s a great idea.

The glass trackpad is 56 x 110 mm (2.20 x 4.33 inches) large and ultra-smooth. Some surface is taken by the three physical buttons (Linux-friendly) and we think it’s well worth it. Alternatively it’s also a click pad so you can mouse-click directly by pressing the trackpad.

Ports

The laptop’s chassis is thick enough to have the essential full-size ports and therefore avoid the need for dongles in most cases. There are two USB-A (full-size) 3.2 Gen1 and two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 (40 Gbit/s Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4a) are the best way to connect to a dock and connect external displays to this computer.

The full-size HDMI (4K/60) port is tremendously helpful for frequent presenters who might need to connect to projectors without fear of forgetting/losing the dongle/adapter—what a great assortment of ports.

Given the theft these days the Kengsington nano-security port seems to be a must-have in some urban areas and thieves might move on to an easier target. It’s also a source of peace of mind when leaving the laptop at your temporary office desk during lunch hour.

1x full HDMI 4K/60Hz

Audio Quality

The sound quality is high. Watching movies or TV shows is enjoyable as voices are clear (also valid for video conferences). The sound is loud enough but getting more bass would have been nice. The bass level is expected for this type of ultralight computer so it’s hard to complain.

Heavy travelers are more likely to use headphones which would bring better spatialization while keeping things quiet for hotel room neighbors.

Display

Lenovo proposes up to seven different 14-inch display 16:10 configurations. Going from a standard WUXGA (1920×1200) resolution with 400 Nits brightness to a 4K WQUXGA (3840×2400) touch screen with superior color accuracy.

One of the most exciting display options is the 2.8K (2880×1800) OLED which is HDR-capable at 500 NITs of brightness. The maximum brightness level requires HDR content but we typically prefer OLED for multimedia applications. For professional creative work IPS LCD might have slightly more accurate colors.

Our unit has a 1920×1200 touchscreen display with excellent brightness (500 NITs) and color accuracy (100% sRGB 1.3 Delta-E). It works great for light creative work (Photo editing Web Dev) and we don’t feel like we need more for what we do. However Lenovo has many fancier options like 4K HDR400.

The display reclines at 180-degree so you can lay it completely flat on a table which could be convenient if you do something with the touchscreen or are presenting to someone sitting on the opposite side of a table. And yes you can open the lid with one finger.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon can handle four independent displays (native + 3 external) thanks to Thunderbolt (5K/60) and HDMI (4K/60).

Webcam

Our camera is the FHD 1080p with an IR (infrared) webcam and electronic privacy shutter but Lenovo also has more affordable 720p options.

The 1080p camera performs noticeably better than previous 720p Lenovo laptop webcams in terms of details and noise. We highly recommend getting the best camera specs if you frequently are on video calls.

Lenovo also has software camera features that will put the laptop in a low-power state if you go away from the computer. The IR camera makes logging in fast and easy despite using a very strong password.

System performance

As expected with Intel’s 12th generation processors the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon does really well in raw CPU performance with nearly 50% higher multicore performance (Geekbench Cinebench) compared to last year’s X1 Carbon. The performance jump comes even though this CPU is a low-wattage model optimized for power efficiency rather than pure speed.

Graphics applications run well too and popular games like Fortnite or Doom Eternal can still run at 30FPS (medium settings) and are playable. However you need realistic expectations as there’s no discrete graphics processor (GPU). Lenovo has other laptops if you need that kind of graphics power.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon doesn’t get crazy hot. Surfaces typically start getting uncomfortable at 44 degrees C and this computer’s hottest spots would be about ~48C hot when under stress which is not that much.

The system self-regulates performance to prevent excessive heat buildup. The fans aren’t noisy and looking at the exhaust system. It’s clear that the computer is optimized for quiet office productivity and light creative work.

From a networking point of view this new model has WiFi-6E (vs. WiFi-6 before) and optional 5G or 4G connectivity which ensures always-on connectivity and additional security as you’re avoiding WiFi hotspots.

Finally the SSD performance has significantly improved since last year with some of the highest numbers in this category – see the chart below for year-to-year comparisons.

X1 Carbon Gen 10 Battery Life

The 57 Wh Li-Polymer battery has not changed since last year and this capacity is serious for this category. As expected the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen10 shows outstanding endurance and can play video for more than 11 hours. Local video playback is often a good battery life proxy for light productivity tasks.

Note that higher resolution displays will drain the battery faster and you can also opt for a U-Series Intel CPU which is even less power-hungry (down to the Core i5-1235U).

The charge speed is just as good as before (0.76Wh/mn) and we have not seen any changes. The charger remains a compact 65W model from Lenovo.

Conclusion

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 has a solid ultralight performance and it’s not surprising that it remains one of the most popular 14″ for Enterprises. We’ve recently seen it being offered by default to employees along with the Macbook Pro. That’s a great place to be.

It comes in many different configurations that make it efficient for many usage models going from basic office productivity to light creative work and development.

Consumers might find the same type of performance characteristics for a smaller budget in the Yoga line of products but they don’t come with the security management and durability the ThinkPads enjoy so yes there’s a price gap but there’s a real value associated with it.

Why buy this laptop?

The performance/weight ratio security options and durability sets the ThinkPad X1 carbon apart from other ultralights. Your IT department will like its vPro remote management and security features. Perhaps accounting might look twice because of the price though.

Potential competitors

Data shows users considering this laptop also look at the following computers (in this order): The ThinkPad T14 Apple MacBook Pro Dell XPS 13 / 13 Plus ThinkPad P1 and Yoga 9i. In our opinion the ThinkPad T14 isn’t an ultralight competitor but offers the same security and durability.

The XPS 13 is more compact because it has a 13.5” display but is heavier with a slightly smaller battery. The Yoga 9i is a powerful consumer product and won’t have the same level of security and durability.

Finally the MacBook Pro is an excellent enterprise computer but that choice is driven by the Max/Windows choice and the hardware is secondary. If you’re a Windows user we recommend the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10.

In 2015 Minneapolis resident DeCourcy Squire shut off the gas to her Stevens Square condo stopped paying the Houston based gas conglomerate CenterPoint Energy (CPE) and began using alternative energy to power her home. She had been a tax resister ever since the Vietnam War and after becoming involved with the grassroots group MN350 working to oppose the Line 3 Dakota Access Pipeline she could not in good conscience contribute to the gas company any longer.

Squire told Unicorn Riot that she first learned about Michels Corporation while protesting Line 3 but didn’t realize they had an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy until recently.

“Pushing for corporate divestment is very important but I think personal divestment is also a small step towards an alternative future” Squire said not just referring to alternative energy but also alternative politics free of corporate influence.

The Michels Corporation including its subsidiaries Michels Pipeline Inc Michels Power Inc. Michels Construction Inc. Michels Utility Services Inc. Michels Trenchless Inc. Michels Road and Stone Inc. and Michels Pacific Energy Inc. has become one of the largest utility contractors in North America. Many Twin Cities activists first became aware of them through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction as reported by Unicorn Riot.

Michels currently has three offices in Minnesota their newest being the Brooklyn Park office which opened in 2017 adding to its Lakeville and Rogers sites. According to Michels website their goal is to expand service capabilities in the Midwest.

CenterPoint Energy’s website lists 27 active projects within Minneapolis alone including Minnehaha Hiawatha Fulton Kenwood and Jordan neighborhoods all using Michels Corporation.

As Transportation Funds Increase So Do Michels’ Revenues

Michels Corp. and Michels Pipeline Construction have involvement in several special interest groups especially three main lobby associations — Wisconsin Transportation Building Association Transportation Development Association and Construction Business Group all with the primary aim to increase state transportation funds allowing for more public contract money to flow directly to the Michels Corporation.

In the 2022 election cycle individual employees and immediate family members of Michels Corporation have donated an accumulated $46142 to campaigns with the Republican National Convention (RNC) being the largest recipient of $20000 according to the research group OpenSecrets a national organization that tracks money in elections and its effects on public policy. This amount is far lower than the $134905 the RNC received from Michels affiliates in the 2020 election cycle. Recent campaign donations to Republican congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden and U.S. Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin has also been tracked to individuals from the Michels Corporation in the amounts of $17399 and $4650 respectively.

Wisconsin Right Now a conservative news outlet found that Michels’ involvement in special interest groups with Michels executives serving in lieu of himself has helped the company acquire nearly 1.2 billion dollars in contracts with the state of Wisconsin implying public-private profiteering. The Minneapolis based news site Southwest Voices reported that Michels Corp. has $12.7 million in contracts with the City of Minneapolis since the start of 2020 alone.

While there is no official tie to Michels personally lobbying for increased gas taxes higher registration fees and blocking tax exemptions on gas and diesel fuel sold to school districts it is clear that special interest groups Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association which Michels served as Board President and the Transportation Development Association where Michels served on the executive board have contributed financially to groups fighting to increase the gas tax.

Both the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that if Tim Michels wins the Wisconsin governorship he said he will divest from the Michels Corporation leaving his two brothers in charge. Regardless if Michels becomes Wisconsin’s next governor his family company and special interest groups will have one of their own at the helm of decisionmaking on government contracts and public utilities spending.

Michels admittedly said that he wants his family to continue seeking state-wide contracts despite obvious political conflicts of interest. The company’s contracts in just the last five years from the state of Wisconsin exceed $660 million in payments.

Tim Michels’ Right-Wing Gubernatorial Campaign

In 2021 Michels announced his candidacy for governor of Wisconsin. But Wisconsin residents have challenged Michels’ residency pointing to his East Coast homes where he lives much of the year including his seventeen-million-dollar mansion in Connecticut and luxury penthouse on New York City’s Upper East Side.

Screenshot of Tim Michels from his gubernatorial campaign ad called Tear Down.

In June 2022 former President Trump endorsed Michels who has supported the “big lie” that Trump won the 2020 election and has suggested he will work to overturn the state’s 2020 election results if he wins in November. He vowed to abolish the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission which administers and enforces state election laws. Additionally Michels has doubled down in recent cultural wars committing to fight so-called ‘critical race theory’ (CRT) being taught in public schools abortion and more.

Michels has been outspoken about his anti-abortion stance and says he’d ban abortion and emergency contraceptives if elected Wisconsin governor. “I believe God is unhappy with the country that allows for the killing of babies” he said at an event in Calumet County WI.

Polls throughout 2022 consistently had former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch ahead as the favorite in the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial primary by a comfortable margin. Kleefisch is supported by her former boss the past GOP rising star former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. However Michels won the Republican primary on August 9 the day after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago with 47% of the vote beating Kleefisch by five points.

Residents React to the Minneapolis – Michels Connection

Residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin are concerned about Michels Corp.’s ongoing government contracts and its exclusive partnership with CenterPoint Energy which holds a monopoly on natural gas in the Twin Cities. These concerns are becoming intensified now as they become aware of their unwitting contribution to Michels’ campaign.

“I wonder if I’m paying for this unnecessary MPD protection & supporting Tim Michels for governor through my CenterPoint bill or directly to MPD with my property taxes?” Nikki Carlson who uses the handle @M_Nikki_dUrso tweeted.

Carlson who is a North Minneapolis resident took to Twitter on July 13 to share her encounter with a Michels worker. She observed what she believed was an ineffective use of Minneapolis law enforcement.

“I asked the Michels guy why there are so many police squads there. He said to guard their employees while working in ‘the ghetto.’”

He explained MPD protection was a condition of their contract. He said “ghetto” to my face.



FYI the contractor replacing the gas lines Michels Construction is based in Wisconsin. Their owner Tim Michels is a right-wing candidate for governor of WI.

North Minneapolis is the historic Black section of the city that has been over-policed and under-resourced for generations activists say.

The Michels’ worker told Carlson that police protection was a condition of their contract. However Michels has been seen working in other parts of the city by residents without police protection.

One person tweeted that Michels’ staff vehicles have far-right bumper stickers on them that make residents feel “very uneasy.”

Minneapolis residents have also raised concerns about Michels’ hiring practices and worry that the company apparently doesn’t hire Black people. “WHY is this co. laying pipe in N. Mpls & putting their workers from Wright County in hotels when we have qualified people right here?” Carlson tweeted.

Minneapolis City Council President Andrea Jenkins has expressed these same concerns in emails. “I share many of the concerns you’ve identified and have brought these issues up with CenterPoint Energy many times…While it is true that our utilities payments support the Michels company no taxpayer dollars support this in fact the utility companies have to pay for permits to the city to do the work.”

However Michels Corp. has several contracts with the city’s Public Works Department paid by Minneapolis taxpayers which was reported last month by Southwest Voices.

Although Minneapolis police (MPD) are providing security for Michels while they do work in North Minneapolis cops are being privately paid through its contract with CPE Council Member Jenkins said.

MPD is allowed to wear their city uniforms and drive taxpayer-funded squad cars while working off-duty security jobs for private companies.

However Fox 9 recently found MPD protecting Target and Michels construction crews during their regular shift. “During those day shifts Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites.”

“During those day shifts Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites”



Yup. Not hard to find… https://t.co/X7SwWAY5XQ pic.twitter.com/VZyoEi2vKC — Dimitri Drekonja (@Ddrekonja) September 15 2022

Carlson tweeted that a drunk cop working security for Michels aggressively confronted her and implied that they are indeed being paid by taxpayers. “Angry intoxicated MPD officer just told me it isn’t about preserving police resources to focus on violent crime it’s about OVERTIME pay for light duty & I need to STFU. (& everyone but me knows this).” She reacted “I was naive thinking the objective was public safety.”

MPD is said to inform contractors in construction when and if they need protection according to a source.

Jenkins added “To be clear I find the response of the Michels employee to the Northside resident’s question to be despicable Michels needs to create a more diverse workforce that reflects the communities they serve.” However the city council president made no commitment to take any action.

One resident who uses the handle @JenAntila tweeted that when their sewer line failed over a decade ago a city public works employee gave them a list of city approved sewer line contractors and said “‘I can’t recommend anyone but my pen slipped’ Michels was circled. I hired them.”

Screenshot from Twitter

@JenAntila told Unicorn Riot that it was mid January when her sewer line failed and that Michels did a good job repairing it. But she also regrets her decision after discovering the politics of the company. “I just hate knowing what an a-hole [Tim] Michels is and knowing how much the city and & constituents (like me) bankroll him and have for decades.”

“These are the same a$$holes that last summer were tearing up forests wet lands & waters in Northern MN to put in another Enbridge pipeline” tweeted another.

Residents noted the irony of Minneapolis cops calling the city dangerous while the same officers are being used to protect private companies rather than protecting the public.

“These police officers care more about protecting out-of-towners from imaginary danger than protecting their own citizens from real danger” one user tweeted.

Also residents claim that police have intentionally made the city more dangerous by slowing down their work and threatening not to exit their squad cars while patrolling.

“And they say they don’t have staff to patrol/have a constant presence in Dinkytown at night” tweeted another.

As Trump-endorsed Republican Tim Michels solidifies his conservative ideologies in Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race it remains unclear to Minneapolis residents just how much they are funding his right-wing campaign steeped in anti-democracy rhetoric simply by paying taxes and their monthly gas bill.

“Minnesota’s energy dollars are supporting a candidate for governor of Wisconsin that wants to ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. He opposes same-sex marriage and all LGBQT rights. Is that what we want? I know I don’t” Carlson told Unicorn Riot.

While the exact dollar amount coming from Minneapolis residents into Michels’ campaign cannot be estimated it is apparent that Tim Michels is profiteering from his company’s contracts with the City of Minneapolis Public Works Department and its exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy helping fund his race — with Michels being the largest donor to his campaign at $11940882.25 of the $12 million raised.

Nathaniel Guthrie who goes by the Twitter handle @WoodGhuthriempls suggested boycotting CPE. ​​“Imagine that Centerpoint energy supports racists. We can’t be shocked that the cops do but this open cowardice and racism from Michels corporation should be stressed to center point.” Adding “Be a shame if we all here in ‘the ghetto’ stopped paying them en masse.”

Screenshot from Twitter

Unicorn Riot called and emailed several people at CenterPoint Energy for this story. When we asked CenterPoint Energy’s Director of Communications in Minneapolis Hannah Gullickson if CPE will respond to the numerous residents who object to funding Michels’ right-wing campaign through their gas bills she said she doesn’t speak to the press and forwarded the message to Ross Corson Senior Communications Specialist. We have not received an immediate response from Corson.

Opening an investment account can be a daunting task. Researching fee structures account types and product features take time and can be perplexing. Plus with so many companies offering investment services it can be tough to know if you’re making a wise decision. Fortunately this guide breaks down two major investment companies: Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab. If you’re hoping for help in automating your investments you may want to work with a financial advisor instead.

Overview of Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab

Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab are giant financial companies offering clients investment services. Each has different features and advantages so your financial circumstances will determine which one’s services are best for you.

Schwab also known as Charles Schwab unites a range of financial services under one roof. It has no trade or account minimums for its investment funds. Plus Schwab clients can invest in actively and passively managed funds. In addition investors can use a hi-tech robo-advisor tool to automate their investments.

Schwab recently acquired TD Ameritrade enhancing its services for clients wanting to trade international currencies. By 2023 it will fully assimilate TD Ameritrade’s functions into its platform. Schwab currently manages about $8 trillion in customer assets.

Merrill Lynch is an investing service operating under Bank of America’s ownership. It offers three investment services: Merrill Edge® Self-Directed Merrill Guided Investing and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Each service has incrementally higher fees and investment minimums and more sophisticated investing tools. It currently manages about $2.75 trillion in assets.

Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab: Fees

One of the ways major brokerage platforms compete is by lowering fees. Merrill Lynch and Schwab are no exception. Here is a breakdown of the major fees for both investment platforms so that you can compare the aspect of the tool you want to use the most.

Charles Schwab Fees

Schwab takes no commissions for online stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and option transactions. Plus it charges nothing for trading mutual funds or bonds. However it charges $0.65 per options contract and $2.25 per futures contract. Broker-assisted trades cost $25 and contacting customer service is free.

In addition investors with less cash can purchase partial shares of stock indexes for $5 apiece. Investors transferring assets out of their accounts will pay $15 to $25. Schwab’s robo-advisor accounts have a $5000 minimum with no fees. Investors with $25000 can open an Intelligent Portfolio Premium account for $300 plus a $30 monthly advisory fee. This account blends robo-advising and certified financial planner services.

Story continues

Schwab’s margin rates range from 10.575% for loans under $25000 to 8.825% for loans of $250000 to $499999. Merrill Lynch does not publicize specific margin rates requiring customers to inquire about current rates. They base your margin rate on your debt load the base lending rate and your assets with Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.

Merrill Lynch Fees

Merrill Edge® Self-Directed is Merrill Lynch’s basic investing account. It charges no commissions for online stock ETFs and options trades. No minimum is necessary to get started. Options trades have a $0.65 contract fee and asset sales incur fees of $0.01 to $0.03 per $1000 of assets. Typically broker-assisted trades cost $19.95 to $39.95 depending on the asset type. Various fees apply to clients holding ETFs. Contacting customer service is free.

Merrill Guided Investing is for investors able to meet a higher minimum requirement. Guided Investing clients can open an account if they have $1000 to invest. They will experience annual fees of 0.45% of assets managed plus the fees mentioned above. Investors with $20000 can access a Guided Investing account with personal financial advisory services and will pay fees of 0.85% of assets managed plus the fees mentioned above.

Lastly Merrill Lynch offers their Wealth Management account for clients with $250000 or more. Wealth Management customers can access a group of advisors to create a thorough financial plan. Because the assets managed are so substantial fees vary based on client needs.

Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab: Services and Features

merrill lynch vs charles schwab

Both companies offer a range of services including individual and joint brokerage accounts 401(k)s individual retirement accounts (IRAs) 529 college saving plans and custodial accounts. Additionally both companies offer banking services as Bank of America owns and operates Merrill Lynch while Schwab banking in its suite of products.

Charles Schwab Services and Features

Clients looking for a robo-advisor can use Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolios® which provide automated investing services and tax-loss harvesting. Also if you have at least $25000 to invest you can access the Intelligent Portfolio Premium service to receive help from a certified financial planner.

For client education Schwab has a daily Q&A stream Monday through Friday for all investing topics. The company aims to present first-rate research to its customers. It has a library of free financial education resources as well. Plus clients can speak with an investment professional 24 hours a day every day of the year via phone.

Merrill Lynch Services and Features

Merrill Lynch has human financial advisors that directly interact with clients for a fee. While they don’t offer robo-advised investment accounts they offer hybrid accounts that blend automated investing tools and oversight from investment professionals. However these features don’t apply to the Merrill Edge® Self-Directed account a no-frills investment tool that places control in the client’s hands.

Merrill Guided Investing clients may receive fee reductions for Bank of America Preferred Rewards bank accounts. In addition they’ll receive guidance for financial planning and investment strategy.

Merrill Lynch customers cannot trade cryptocurrency or access the foreign currencies marketplace. Additionally its customers can’t access fractional shares.

All Merrill Lynch customers can access investment education videos and resources for free. Their resources cater to all knowledge levels and cover expansive topics. Finally Merrill Lynch’s customer service is available Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Merrill Lynch vs. Schwab: Online and Mobile Experience

Both companies’ apps have favorable ratings but customer feedback contains numerous complaints. Schwab sometimes can overwhelm the average user with data. However it offers an intuitive interface on mobile and desktop. That said active traders will probably like the Schwab Street Smart desktop version because the mobile version lacks certain features. Schwab Mobile has a 4.8-star rating on the Apple store and 3.7 stars on Google Play. On the other hand Schwab’s Street Smart mobile app has 1.5 stars on the Apple store and 2.2 stars on Google Play.

Merrill Lynch has two mobile apps as well: the Merrill Edge app for Edge clients and MyMerrill for Guided Investing and Wealth Management members. Edge app users praise its ease of use and availability of investment research. It holds a 4.6-star rating on the Apple store and 4 stars on Google Play.

MyMerrill users give similar feedback and emphasize its streamlined nature especially for Bank of America customers. The app has a 4.7-star rating on the Apple Store and 4 stars on Google Play.

Who Should Use Which Investment Platform?

Merrill Lynch and Schwab both offer low-fee accessible investment options for investors. As a result novice investors prioritizing inexpensive investing could be satisfied opening an account with either company.

However the companies diverge from that point. Investors who want to use a robo-advisor are more likely to go with Schwab as Merrill Lynch does not offer a pure robo-advisor option. Additionally investors who want to dive deep into the data may prefer Schwab which provides additional investing tools and analysis through its Street Smart platform.

On the other hand wealthier investors who prefer white-glove treatment may be drawn to Merrill Lynch’s services. Its Guided Investing and Wealth Management products provide a dedicated financial advisor who can help you create a financial plan and invest accordingly.

The Bottom Line

merrill lynch vs charles schwab

Merrill Lynch and Schwab are significant players in the individual investing market. Both firms offer robust services from bank accounts and IRAs to college funds and charge minimal fees. In addition their mobile apps are generally easy to use. Investing with either company will help you make gains without suffering large fees. That said investors with more money may receive more individualized services from Merrill Lynch while investors who want to use market research or robo-advisors might prefer Schwab.

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year — her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website — the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page — so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being naïve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

What to do if you've been scammed",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjIxNDMzNC9lcmlrYS1qYW1lcy1seW5uLXBlcnJ5LXdvb3Rlbi1pbnRlcnZpZXctcHJlcGFyZWQtbGVhZGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Leaders Should Be Thinking About the Next Crisis,"(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

Erika H. James dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Lynn Perry Wooten president of Simmons University are leaders in their field who are also experts in leadership. The pair have spent two decades researching and writing about the topic and previously wrote the 2010 book Leading Under Pressure. Their new book The Prepared Leader was written during the COVID-19 pandemic and draws on years of research and interviews with leaders about their experiences leading during the tumult of 2020.

James and Wooten did all this while themselves transitioning into their current jobs at the height of the pandemic in 2020. James became the first woman and person of color to lead the Wharton School while Wooten became Simmons’ first Black president.

“We were living out what we were writing in this book as leaders of the Wharton School or of Simmons University” says James. “That duality of experiencing it trying to be effective leaders while also writing about it and leveraging our research at the same time is a really powerful part of our professional history.”

James and Wooten spoke with TIME about why they believe preparedness should be the “fourth P” in a company’s bottom line along with people profit and the planet. They also discussed the importance of establishing—and maintaining—diversity in crisis management teams and the role of what they call “mega communities” like the #MeToo or Black Lives Matter movements—broad and diverse collectives of stakeholders that can span organizations sectors and sometimes societies.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Why do you think that leaders were so woefully unprepared for the pandemic and other crises before it?

James: We don’t generally like thinking about or anticipating bad news and the notion of a pandemic of this scale we’ve seen signals or smaller versions of this in the past 20 years or so. But we’ve always been able to navigate them. They didn’t have hardly at all the effects that the pandemic of COVID-19 had on a country or certainly around the world. And so I think we are easy to dismiss the notion that something as catastrophic as a crisis would actually materialize and that we would be affected by them. So because our brain doesn’t like to think about negative news we tend not to prepare for bad things.

Wooten: It’s not only that our brains don’t need to think about it we don’t educate leaders for it. So people have to study accounting and HR and strategic planning and finance and marketing. But when you talk to leaders about their on-the-job training their formal training their college training very little time gets them to think about the skill sets the competencies you need for leading in a crisis situation. And how you take those skill sets that we talked about in a book and become this prepared leader means that you also think about it in the context of the people who work in your organization whatever your profit model is or your effective model—and the planet.

Some might argue that if you’re as a leader constantly focused on what crisis might be ahead perhaps you’re not as focused on the day-to-day running of the business. How should leaders be balancing those two priorities?

James: We have to do both quite frankly. And I think the most effective leaders are constantly thinking about what we need to do to achieve our strategic objectives while also being mindful that we rarely ever perfectly achieve the goals and objectives that [we] set out to achieve. Things are always happening and the best leaders are those who think about where their vulnerabilities—either internal to their organization or where there might be external threats that prohibit their organization from achieving the results in the timeframe that they had desired. So we’re unprepared because we don’t like to think about them we’re not taught to think about them—the best leaders understand that being effective means doing both strategic leadership and crisis preparedness.

You write in the book about “sudden” and “smoldering” crises. Could you explain how leaders’ responses to those should differ?

Wooten: The smoldering crises are the ones hopefully that you have time to prepare for—you’re constantly scanning the environment you’re looking for signals. You’re saying “what could happen possibly.” Even the pandemic when you started to see it happening in other countries leaders had to ask themselves “what’s going to happen if it comes to the United States?” So those smoldering crises have been gradual. Sudden crises: you don’t know they’re going to happen—they take you off guard. But if you have the skill set [to think] “OK how are we going to communicate? How are we going to build trust? How are we resourceful? How do we mobilize all of our stakeholders?” then you may not know the crisis [is coming]—a national disaster or a lawsuit or something—but at least you have the skill set to activate your leadership team.

James: I’ll add that typically we spend our time thinking about those external sudden crises. Most organizations have an active shooter plan most organizations have a weather events strategy if a hurricane or something happens. So we plan for the things that are generally least likely to happen—those sudden events. What we don’t tend to plan for are the smoldering events which generally are things that are happening inside the organization that are oftentimes a function of bad decision-making ineffective behavior a poor culture—those kinds of things that sort of simmer under the radar until they erupt because nobody has paid attention to them.

Not paying attention to these sorts of issues can have a very serious financial impact. How important is preparedness to a company’s bottom line?

Wooten: Crises can cost money—it’s how much money do we leave [behind] because we have to stop business: money that we lose from lawsuits money that we lose from reputational effects. And this is where we talk about the intersection of being a prepared leader with your profit. The better that you can be a prepared leader you can prevent crisis so you’re saving money. You can preserve your reputation. You can make sure that your operations can go on.

How have you both drawn on your own experiences of fighting fires as leaders for the learnings that you present in the book?

James: I’ll share a quick story. Lynn and I wrote an initial book several years ago called Leading Under Pressure. And when I was sharing that book with some neighbors they said “Oh is that a parenting book?” That was such an unusual response to a book titled Leading Under Pressure but in hindsight you realize that as parents we’re constantly doing the work of crisis leadership. We’re constantly scanning to see what could go wrong with our kids. We’re constantly trying to prepare them for the next step in their life. We’re constantly trying to put out fires when something bad happens to our children. So I think as parents we’re very well attuned to naturally thinking about things going wrong. We don’t oftentimes make that shift to the workplace. That’s not to say that employees are like children but it’s the same level of responsibility that a leader has and understanding what we need to be mindful of is the active part of preparation.

Wooten: For me I’m constantly scanning my environment and trying to make sense of what’s going to happen what could be the next crisis on the horizon. I lead a small university and in the United States. We talk about the demographic cliff especially for small universities as fewer students are going to college as people are moving from different sides of the country. And so I’m thinking about “OK how is this demographic cliff going to require me to innovate to rethink the business model of my university?” So the sense-making creativity the innovation… We have a tool where we talk about how you take a crisis and look at it as an opportunity to do something different. In the book we talk about the National Basketball Association and how they used the pandemic. There are many examples where we’ve seen organizations reinvent themselves and the crisis has become an opportunity to do something better—either the way you organize people or how you do technology or how you change your business model. So I’m constantly thinking about opportunities too.

What are the biggest lessons for businesses from the pandemic?

Wooten: We can be agile. Never before have we seen industries and businesses and communities reinvent themselves. You take healthcare and telemed you take universities and K-12 systems going online so we can be agile. And so how do we do things quicker? The other big lesson is looking for examples of effective communication. We know that in crisis situations leaders have to communicate communicate communicate. We talk about that in the book. It’s important because you want to build trust. And so being competent having a psychological contract as you communicate with people are so important—and having compassion.

James: I would add that one of the key lessons is recognizing that our tendency generally when we experience threat is to retreat and become very limited in how or where we seek information. And because a crisis means it’s something that we’ve not experienced before whatever is in our history our past is not going to inform us in terms of how to respond to this crisis. So the need for creativity—the need for intentionally seeking out information and ideas and new perspectives to help us solve a problem that we’ve never experienced before—that sort of goes against our psyche. But the leaders who have been most effective are those who are actually able to expand the sources from which they draw information and problem-solving.

What should leaders today be thinking about when it comes to leading through the next crisis big or small?

James: To me it’s thinking about understanding the lessons that they’ve learned or what they’ve experienced going through the pandemic and evaluating honestly “what did we do well in responding to that what didn’t really do well and responding to that? What structures or policies or procedures do we have in place that can help us mitigate the next crisis?” Guaranteed the next crisis probably will not be another pandemic but it will be something else. And there’s muscle memory. If we are intentional about learning from what we just went through we can leverage that muscle memory to help inform us the next time something else happens—but only if we are intentional about reflecting and learning the lessons having just gone through the previous crisis.

Wooten: We talk about mega communities [in the book.] It’s not only looking inside your organization to say what did you do well or what did you need to improve but “who do I need to partner with? How do I expand my network so I’m a better organization?” Mega communities say a lot of tough problems need the three sectors: you need government you need the nonprofit sector and you need the corporate sector. We saw that in the pandemic. Who else managed that last crisis well? What can I learn from them?

What are the key skills you’ve identified that leaders need to be able to handle a crisis?

James: Generally effective crisis leaders will engage in signal detection to understand what are the vulnerabilities and what do we need to be on the lookout for? The next phase is around crisis planning and prevention. When a crisis does hit there’s the notion of damage control or containment—how do we limit its impact? And the fourth stage is business recovery. And then lastly there’s the learning phase.

Within each of those phases Lynn and I have identified several key leadership traits or competencies that are necessary so in the signal detection phase for example one trait is sense-making. How do I make sense of all of the information that’s coming at me how do I put it together in a way that allows me to communicate to the broader organization? Here’s what we’re learning and here’s what we can start to prepare for it.

Wooten: I [also] want to talk about our risk taking. Sometimes during a crisis when you’re reinventing yourself and adapting to the world you have to think about what risks we’re going to take. [For example] we’re going to take all the basketball players and create a bubble in Orlando. Some of that was risk taking. But it’s assessing the risks and understanding what the pros and cons are. Erica and I talk a lot about how one of the leader’s roles in the crisis is to ensure resiliency. Yeah you’re going into this panic you’re going to become paralyzed but at some point you’re going to have to bounce back. Resiliency is “how am I going to bounce back and what is it going to take for me to be better? What are the investments I have to make—the team I need the financial investments the infrastructure—so that I can be resilient in that recovery mode?”

And with that kind of risk-taking when it is something like the pandemic you are having to make those decisions very quickly as well.

Wooten: Yep. Part of being quick is you’ve got to have the data and you have to have the theory of change—”why am I doing this? What does the data show me?” And being ethical. All the stakeholders are going to be involved in your risky decision. What are you doing to ensure their well being in a crisis situation?

James: I think it’s important to highlight that not all stakeholders are equal. You have people who are advocates for your organization and want to support everything that you’re doing. You’ll have people who are sort of ambivalent they may know your company but they don’t feel one way or another about it. And then you have people who are potentially very aggressively antagonistic to your company. And in times of crisis it might be [that] the people who might be most vocal might not be the ones who need the most attention. So those who are antagonistic to you might be very much all over social media. They might be very much present and vocal and you might feel like you need to devote your attention to that group. But they’re less likely to want to support you no matter what your efforts are because they are naturally antagonistic to what it is you do. The real key especially in a time of crisis is to pay attention to those who are ambivalent so that you avoid those from becoming antagonistic and you potentially are able to influence them to become your advocates. And I don’t think leaders oftentimes recognize [that]—they’ll go to the loudest voices but the loudest voices are not always the stakeholders that need and deserve the leaders’ attention.

Diversity is something that you identify as an important element when building a team that’s equipped for a crisis. There was a recent study from Imperial College Business School which found that diversity on boards is something that’s often sacrificed when companies are struggling. How can organizations prevent that from happening?

James: I think it really is a matter of the intention of the leader. If the leader understands the value that comes from having diverse perspectives on the board and the management team—wherever—then he or she will facilitate creating a diverse and inclusive environment in both of those settings. And then it becomes making sure that the board is aligned with the values of diversity. It becomes the board’s responsibility to ensure that the leader and the managers are in fact engaging in practices that create an inclusive communities such that the value of diversity the voices—the perspectives that allow a leader to make the most effective decisions—are in fact being heard.

Wooten: I believe most leaders want to have diverse inclusive organizations but haven’t thought about the roadmap. And so it’s asking yourself “When I look around the table especially the boardroom who’s missing especially relevant to this organization?” And then “what is my plan to make sure that the people who are missing can be in the room to make it happen?” And part of that once you get them in the room is that they have to feel like they belong. We talk about in the book going to all different types of experts to resolve the crisis and hearing various voices from outside the organization at the top of the organization and at the bottom.

And crisis always calls for you to really think about diversity and equity and inclusion. We definitely saw it in the pandemic as we saw for example women exiting the workplace as we saw how people were dealing with the social reckoning. So sometimes crises—a natural disaster or something like a medical crisis—will have a parallel to diversity issues.

James: Oftentimes when we now use the phrase diversity we immediately turn to demographic diversity and think we need more women we need more people of color. And while that continues to be true for most organizations we’re also inclusive in our approach to diversity especially in a time of crisis because our tendency as leaders is to go to the content experts. So in a crisis we’re gonna go to the legal counsel and we might go to public relations or head of communications. And those folks are important contributors to understanding how best to navigate the crisis. But if those are the only two perspectives and we’re not going to people who are interfacing with customers on a daily basis if we’re not going to our customers if we’re not going to shareholders to understand the perspective that they bring then we’re not going to have the most fulsome set of information and data upon which to make a decision. So for us demographic diversity is important but it’s not the only kind of diversity that matters in a time of crisis.

Do you have any tips for people who have that perspective and are struggling to have their voices heard within an organization?

Wooten: When I’m coaching people like that I [say] “think about where are opportunities to showcase your knowledge in multiple communications. Maybe you don’t feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting but it could be an email it could be a water cooler conversation it could be a text message but think about various communication pathways that you can showcase your expertise.” The other thing is I always say partner with someone—the CFO partnering with the chief marketing officer. Spend some time with a person from a different background to share what you’re working on and how you can manage through the crisis and get their perspective.

James: I would add aligning your work—or the communication that you want to get upward into the organization—with the strategic priority of the organization. That way it’s more likely to get the attention of top management because it’s already an area or a topic or an issue that they’re focused on. So if you can align whatever it is you’re trying to get communicated in the context of that strategic priority is much more likely to get attention.

What role does technology play in both creating and combating crises?

Wooten: We all have seen crises be birthed from social media or cybersecurity so the chief information officer the chief technology officer is an important member of any organization’s crisis leadership team. They always have to be on the lookout. But technology is an efficient solution to a lot of crises. I gave the example of technology being the solution for how we get medical appointments during the pandemic—the telemed. Likewise we’ve seen that a lot of organizations were successful communicating on social media for example using technology to find out where there were outbreaks of COVID or using technology to find out where you can get vaccinated.",,,,,,,,,

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

Instead of a relatively unobstructed view of Cedar and Rattlesnake mountains overlooking the city now anyone looking that way will see a large yellow crane. It’s waiting in eager anticipation to help build a controversial Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple that a group of local residents are trying to stop in Park County District court.

Later this month a final hearing will be held in the lawsuit that was filed by neighbors of the proposed temple site and others trying to block its construction.

The decision made by Johnson County Judge John R. Perry coming out of the May 23 hearing will likely determine if construction of the temple can begin.

In the meantime the church seems ready to start as soon as it’s able with a host of large shipping containers with components of the temple being moved to the temple site off Skyline Drive.

Outrage

Many in Cody expressed outrage on social media this week that not only had the crane been moved to the proposed site but so have modular units for the proposed Cody LDS temple. These storage units contain materials for the 101-foot-tall temple’s construction.

The church announced in a press release this week that because the previous spot the containers were stored is no longer available it had to move them to a site adjacent to where the temple will be built.

As first reported by Cowboy State Daily in 2023 these items were being stored at Y-Tex Corp. a business owned by a member of the church who had donated the land for the temple.

“This new storage location will avoid future crossings of public roads with these modular units during the temple construction” said Jimmie Edwards second counselor for the LDS Cody Wyoming Stake in a press release. “The church is not yet commencing construction of the temple.”

The church owns the temple property and is fully allowed to use the site to keep the containers there.

But many locals say the optics look bad and that it serves as evidence that construction of the temple is inevitable.

Others defend the project saying it’s hypocritical that critics aren’t similarly outraged about two historic buildings that were torn down in the city earlier this year.

Not So?

The nearly 10000-square-foot temple sparked controversy mainly because of the size of the building and its steeple on an almost 5-acre piece of land overlooking Cody. Some living in the neighborhood say the steeple will destroy their viewshed and the temple will have other negative impacts like ruining the night sky and creating more traffic.

The temple dispute is a topic that has dragged on for more than a year in Cody. The issue has riled up the community causing a clear divide between those who support and oppose the project.

Cody resident Dylan Wood who runs youth ministries in town said he’s very disappointed with how some people have been speaking about the temple online particularly those he knows to be of the Christian faith using scripture in what he sees as a distrustful and hateful manner.

“There’s been some really hateful stuff from people who are ‘Christians’ and it really hurts my heart” he said.

Wood said people need to remember the Ten Commandments which state that “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

Although he’s under no illusion that Cody is perfect Wood said many people seem to prefer being upset about something rather than appreciating the positivity in the community around them. Five years down the road after the temple is finished Wood believes the community will have already forgotten about it.

Carla Egelhoff an organizer with Protect Our Cody Neighborhoods (POCN) a group fighting the church in court hasn’t forgotten about the temple yet. Egelhoff said she isn’t personally bothered by the materials being moved to the temple site but has no idea if the church is telling the truth about why it is moving them.

Optimism

Egelhoff said she believes her group’s case is strong. POCN is challenging the decision made by the Cody Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) to allow construction of the temple last August.

“POCN has entered compelling legal arguments based on the Wyoming State Statutes and Cody city ordinances in support of a decision to reverse the PZB decisions and remand the conditional use permit and the site plan back to the City of Cody” Egelhoff said.

If the judge doesn’t rule in POCN’s favor Egelhoff said the group will consider filing an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Egelhoff also mentioned how the Cody City Council approved a number of changes as a result of how the temple approval process played out. Most notably this includes more deference to the city’s master plan and notification to landowners in a larger range around a proposed project for a conditional use permit (CUP).

According to the Cody Enterprise  under the new code if 20% or more of the property owners object to a project the PZB can only make a recommendation to the city council which then gets the final decision. In the past only Planning and Zoning Board members had a final say on CUPs.

“The change of number of neighbor notifications and handling of nearby affected property owners input is welcomed at this time” Eglehoff said. “Significant opposition to requests that are outside of current zoning ordinances ought to be addressed by elected officials. More opportunities for citizen participation will be positive for Cody into the future.”

Also when a site plan is under consideration there now must be approval from the majority of the board not just the members present at a meeting which aligns with Wyoming law. This had been a major source of contention at a meeting last summer where a majority of the board members present at a meeting rejected its site plan not the board as a whole.

Learn about First Church of Cannabis how it started how to join,"Did you know Indianapolis has a place of worship dedicated to marijuana?

Testing the bounds of religious freedom this establishment was created to respond to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act opening its doors the same day the law went into effect.

""This is what I live by and I have more faith in this religion than any other"" Bill Levin founder of the Church of Cannabis told IndyStar in May 2015. ""This is my lifestyle. This is millions of people's lifestyle."" Here's what we know.

Indiana Marijuana LegislationCould Indiana decriminalize marijuana after a recent DEA announcement? Here's what we know

What is the Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis was founded by Levin in 2015 in response to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was signed into law by former governor Mike Pence on March 26 2015 and went into effect on July 1 2015.

When the law finally went into effect on July 1 the doors of Levin's beloved establishment opened that same day as previously reported by the IndyStar. According to the First Church of Cannabis website the group's mission is to ""celebrate life's great adventure by building on compassion good health and love.""

While the group is unable to participate in the ""holy sacrament"" of being able to light up at their regular Wednesday service they've found other ways to fill the time according to the IndyStar. A typical service starts with a shorter sermon from Levin before opening the floor to members to discuss concerns. They also perform a ""diety dozen"" with affirmations of marijuana as a means of healing. Learn more about the ""diety dozen"" here.

Where is the First Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis is located at 3400 S Rural St. in Indianapolis.

Who founded the First Church of Cannabis?

Levin 68 founder and leader of the First Church of Cannabis is a long-standing marijuana advocate who began working with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the late 19990s according to the church's website. He eventually started his own pro-cannabis organization ReLegalize Indiana.

Levin also ran for political positions as a Libertarian in the early 2010s with marijuana legislation as a key focus but came up short. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed ""Bill took this as an opportunity to establish The First Church of Cannabis on the basis of 'Cannatarian' religion where love is the most important and including the sacrament cannabis"" according to Church of Cannabis.

Marijuana Church challenges Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Levin and the Church of Cannabis filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana Pence and Attorney General Greg Zoeller in July 2015 with the claim that denying them the right to smoke in public infringes on religious freedom. A second lawsuit was filed on March 3 2016 against the city of Indianapolis the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and former Police Chief Rick Hite.

The filed suits argued that members' use of marijuana at the Church of Cannabis should be protected under Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act but was dismissed by the Indiana Court of Appeals in December of 2018.

""I feel sorry for the people who are not educated in this subject matter"" Levin previously said to the IndyStar. ""We'll keep doing what we're doing because we're doing God's work.""

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church’s Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

“Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church” he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the “State of the Union” for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You’ve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You’ve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there’s a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I’m working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They’ve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‘This has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth’ but it’s just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it’s like ‘OK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it’s it’s changing.’ So Utah’s very dynamic is the point I’m trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It’s not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it’s just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ’s teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built — there seems to be one open house after another in Utah — I just hope that the members of the church don’t get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‘Boy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple’ and a lot more focused on ‘What promises am I making what are those covenants?’ — the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We’re hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we’re hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they’ll think about the Savior and they’ll think about the sacred promises they’ve made and they’ll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that’s the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We’re going to teach that. We’re going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson’s behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they’ll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one’s life?

Elder Pearson: My wife’s parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it’s to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we’re in it for the long term. We don’t let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they’ve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that’s different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you’re facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you’re listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they’re also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That’s something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

The road to the top is often long and winding. Just read about this journey to the top of professional baseball.

When I saw this headline — “How a forgotten basketball icon revolutionized the NBA and blazed a trail for Nikola Jokic” — I immediately thought of the late BYU star Kresimir Cosic. And sure enough he was in the story."

MAS’s new Financial Services Industry Transformation Map 2025 lays out the growth strategies to further develop Singapore as a “leading international financial centre in Asia”.

The report predicts that the financial sector will grow by an average 4% to 5% a year during 2021 to 2025 and that this will create 3000 to 4000 net new jobs on average each year.

It also outlines “asset class strengths” – i.e. the parts of financial services in which Singapore plays a key regional or global role and which will generate the most growth (and as a result the most jobs):

Foreign exchange: MAS wants to “broaden and deepen the electronic foreign exchange (FX) trading ecosystem by anchoring more FX platforms and liquidity takers” in the city state.

Wealth management: ESG appears to be a priority in this sector because MAS wants Singapore to “become Asia’s centre for philanthropy through building impact monitoring solutions philanthropy advisory competencies and innovative philanthropy models”.

Asset management: MAS want to enhance the Variable Capital Company regime (which has attracted more buy-side firms to the country) and other fund structures to cater to broader industry needs.

Private capital markets: The regulator aims to “develop private credit to complement private equity and venture capital funding”.

Fintech: An obvious area of growth but interestingly the focus is on the anchoring “promising fintech start-ups in areas like web 3.0 artificial intelligence and green fintech”.

Insurance: This is about Singapore being a catalyse in “insurance risk advisory and alternative risk transfer solutions for Asia to address pandemic climate and cyber risks and facilitate the participation of capital markets in risk financing”.

Thousands in Haiti faced water shortages after days of protest virtually halted distribution eyewitnesses said on Saturday as an approaching storm caused more worry in the reeling country.

Many residents of Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince have been forced to shelter at home this week as gunfire broke out and burning tires blocked streets during protests offuel price hikes and crime.

That slowed or halted companies that typically deliver water in the city where daily highs have been hitting 34 degrees centigrade (93 degrees Fahrenheit).

Many took advantage of an expected half day truce to rush to distribution centers to stockpile a few days supply of water and cooking gas which has also run short in many places.

Fears about the approach of tropical storm Fiona also fueled the rush to get water. Forecasters said the storm’s heaviest rains were more likely to hit the Dominican Republic on the east of Hispaniola island.

Jean-Denis Sévère a resident of Fort National said many had to travel miles to fill buckets and bottles then lug them back home.

“I live in Fort National since there are blockades in the country we came here to buy water. If it was not for these places we would die from thirst” he said.

The country’s latest unrest came as inflation surged to its highest in a decade and gang violence has left hundreds dead and thousands displaced with much of Haiti’s territory beyond government reach.

Richardson Adrien a Port-au-Prince resident told Reuters the lack of potable water was just the latest headache. Residents in recent months have also struggled to find fuel leaving some unable to work.

Finding clear water “is a problem. We look for it everywhere and we can’t find it. We put Clorox in the water to be able to drink it you can’t find water” he said.

The Haitian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(AP) — In a year of having to bounce back Andrea Lee recovered from two early bogeys and pulled away with five birdies on the back nine Sunday to close with a 6-under 66 and win the AmazingCre Portland Classic for her first LPGA Tour title.

Lee took the lead for good with an 18-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole and then hit a superb bunker shot from left of the 17th green to save par and keep a two-shot lead.

She was in the middle of the 18th fairway when she watched Daniela Darquea of Ecuador finish with a third straight birdie for a 66 to pull within one shot. Lee drilled her approach to 15 feet and lagged her putt to within inches to tap in for the win.

It was quite a turnaround for Lee a former No. 1 amateur from Stanford whose game got off track to the point her LPGA status suffered and she started the year on the developmental Epson Tour.

And then she climbed her way out of it winning on the Epson Tour taking advantage of sponsor exemptions with solid play and finally cashing in at Columbia Edgewater Country Club for her first win.

Her face was awash in a mixture of champagne and tears especially when she paid tribute to her grandfather who died late last year.

“He always believed I was a champion and today I am one” Lee said.

This took a great deal of patience and resilience with eight players having a chance to win throughout the final round and every mistake seemingly magnified.

Lee started in a three-way tie with Lilia Vu another former No. 1 amateur at UCLA and Ayaka Furue of Japan. Lee immediately fell off the pace with bogeys on the second and third holes.

“I told myself to stay patient because I still had a lot of golf left” Lee said. “I managed to get three birdies back and then I kept going.”

She finished at 19-under 269 and moved to No. 18 in the Race to CME Globe

Darquea's runner-up finish moved her to No. 59 a big week because the top 60 advance to the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in November. Darquea had been ranked No. 108 going into Portland.

The real threat to Lee came from Esther Henseleit of Germany who took the lead with an 18-foot birdie putt on the par-3 13th. She had a 6-foot birdie try on the next hole that caught the lip but didn't drop and she traded birdies with Lee along the back nine.

Henseleit was one shot behind when she came up short of the 17th green pitched about 12 feet long and missed her par putt to fall two back.

She finished with a par for a 66 and tied for third with Narin An (64) Hannah Green (67) Furue (68) and Vu (68).

Maja Stark of Sweden who earned her LPGA card by winning the ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland ran off five straight birdies on the front nine and was among the leaders until she ran out of steam. She shot 66 and finished eighth.

Lee becomes the ninth first-time winner on the LPGA Tour this year.

“It's more than anything I could have imagined” she said. “I can't believe it actually. I can't believe I'm standing here after what I went through last year.”

Lee won eight times at Stanford and won the Mark H. McCormack medal in 2019 as the leading amateur in women's golf. But her confidence took a hit during first her two years on the LPGA Tour which included the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.

It felt like starting over at the start of the year leading her to where she thought she always thought she would be.

Photographs taken in stores in Russia show Iranian Coke produced under licence in Iran has made its way into Russian stores. Described by bne’s Iran correspondent as “very sweet” the Iranian version of the beverage is taking up shelf space vacated by Russian-made Coca-Cola since The Coca-Cola Company suspended its business in Russia in March in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The arrival of the Persian Coca-Cola brand came as a shock to Russians looking to quench their thirst with “The Real Thing”.

One Russian social media account dubbed the drink “Aya-kola” while another quipped that after two sips of the Iranian Coke “you will be defending the Islamic Revolution and with three sips you’ll be off to fight in Yemen.”

Soft drinks from several countries have turned up on the Russian market since sanctions and market boycotts disrupted Russia’s economy according to social media posts. Products from countries including China and Montenegro have been spotted while a Dr Pepper from Poland is also now seen in Russian shopping baskets.

The Russian introduction of Iranian Coke—with the product retailing at around Russian ruble (RUB) 60 ($0.99) per can—signifies that suppliers in the Islamic Republic are making real headway in sending their products to Russia’s disrupted consumer markets.

Russian media reports in recent months have described trade entrepreneurs trying to plug dozens of market gaps with Iranian alternatives. The US even fears Moscow is addressing a lack of manufacturing potential for the making of armed drones by acquiring hundreds of Iranian drones.

Iran’s decades of international isolation since its 1979 Islamic Revolution have forced the country to perfect the emulation of a huge number of products unobtainable in sufficient volumes from abroad or to evade sanctions in sourcing products. Russia is now on the same road and is turning to Iran for advice.

One thing’s for sure the sad events that led to the departure of Coke from Russia certainly don’t jive with Coca-Cola’s famous 1971 “I’d like to buy the world a Coke” advertising campaign.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvY2EtY29sYS5jb20vYmQvZW4vbWVkaWEtY2VudGVyL3dvbWVuLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNlbnRyZXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWxpdmVzLW9mLXJ1cmFsLXdvbWVuLWNvY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women Business Centres: Transforming lives of rural women,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvY2EtY29sYS5jb20vYmQvZW4vbWVkaWEtY2VudGVyL3dvbWVuLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNlbnRyZXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWxpdmVzLW9mLXJ1cmFsLXdvbWVuLWNvY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C12D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

By proposing a compelling love story between hearing and deaf characters McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary have been selected as finalists for the Coca-Cola Refreshing Films contest.

“We had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that.

Refreshing Films

According to the Coca-Cola website “The Coca-Cola Refreshing Films program is a platform to provide students from partnered schools the opportunity to create content for the big screen.”

For over 20 years 17 colleges have competed in this program. This year marks the first time RIT students have been given the opportunity to compete.

Not only is this the first year that RIT students will beincluded in the competition but also the first time the Refreshing Films Program included in the competition but also the first time the Refreshing Films Program will include the deaf community as well.

The application process is an undertaking but The application process is an undertaking but that didn’t stop McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary from taking it head-on.

“There’s a script and we work together to develop a first draft” Ponte-Fleary explained. “We got help from two [School Of Film and An] faculty members Jack Beck and Frank Deese and went through the whole drafting iteration process.”

The students also had to create a budget sheet with a hypothetical had to create a budget sheet with a hypothetical limit of $18000 and submit all application materials along with a physical application. McClanahan of $18000 and submit all application materials along with a physical application. McClanahan discussed having to partner up with another student where one student would act as the producer and the other student could fill any other role typically the director.

“We got selected for semi-finals which was 15 scripts out of 500” McClanahan explained. “From there you add things like a storyboard update your script update your budget have lots of meetings with [Coca-Cola] then you submit it; from there there is one winner.”

Needless to say there was a substantial amount of work put into this project. a substantial amount of work put into this project.

Balancing a Budget

Once selected as finalists the students actually received the $18000 budget to professionally produce their short film.

Does $18000 sound like a lot of money? In the world of professional commercials that budget is stretched thin. The cost of renting equipment providing food attire hair/makeup paying the actors crew and interpreters adds up. As the producer of the film Ponte-Fleary was in charge of the budget and distribution as well as re-distribution as necessary

“It was a challenge” Ponte-Fleary said “$18000 doesn’t go a long way and we had to re-analyze lots of times.”

Although the students were not able to receive financial help other people were allowed to offer assistance.

Dr. Gerard Buckley president of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf generously covered the interpreting costs. Shanti Thakur director of the School of Film and Animation (SOFA) helped make sure all of the project's pieces ran smoothly.

Other contributors were the College of Art and Design (CAD) who helped cover insurance for the equipment and Sew-n-City who helped with hair and makeup.

With all of this assistance McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary were able to create the look and feel they had imagined.

“We had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that“We had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that“We had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that "" McClanahan said.

Deaf Representation

A large part of the film was the inclusion of the hard of hearing and deaf communities both on-screen and off. This was one of McClanahan’s main goals when starting this project.

McClanahan explained the inspiration for the film coming from representing the type of community at RIT the inspiration for the film coming from representing the type of community at RIT since this is the first year RIT is able to participate. The team made sure to incorporate this in all aspects of the film. Originally the plot was centered around two characters: one hearing and one deaf which could originally be interpreted as hanging out as friends. After meeting with the Coca-Cola company they decided to make it a love story.

“I wanted to make sure I had deaf crew members because as a hearing person it would be inauthentic not to have anyone on the set if I don’t understand that community” McClanahan said. “Also working with Gabe and being able to add those elements to the character being accurate with the language mannerisms and culture.”

Although there have been more deaf characters on the big screen in recent times – Echo in Hawkeye and Makari in Eternals to name a few – this is the first time Coca-Cola would represent the deaf community providing a monumental step towards the representation of more diversity within the film industry.

“Really it’s amazing” Ponte-Fleary said. “I am very proud that we are able to do this because it is huge. [Coca-Cola] has never had the deaf community involved in anything on the big screen… I mean really we’re making history with it.”

Amazing Perspectives

This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is just the start for McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary. The experience they have had so far is unmatched. From finding out they were chosen as semi-finalists to watching their script come to life the process has been unimaginable.

“It was an amazing feeling” Ponte-Fleary “It was an amazing feeling” Ponte-Fleary said. “You never know how far you are going to go.”

One thing McClanahan would like others to take away from the project is thatyou shouldn’t be afraid to branch out into other communities and cultures.

“When you bring different perspectives together it creates really great films. It’s a great time to explore and learn about different people” McClanahan said. “If you’re only creating things from your perspective there are so many other communities that don’t get represented.”

McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary wanted to thank everyone that helped make their film possible. There was so much support inside and out and they could never be more thankful.

The Coca-Cola Refreshing Films challenge is all about empowering the filmmakers of the next generation. By being the first students to not only represent RIT but also the deaf community in their film McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary are undoubtedly empowering generations to come.

""The vision was to make sure it was all of our dreams not just the two of us.

About 60 different rides make up this year's state fair midway and they all require either individual tickets or carnival armbands to ride. Rides take between three and six tickets.

Available at the carnival ticket booths armbands are $35 for Monday through Wednesday at the fair $25 for Thrifty Thursday and $50 for Friday through Sunday. Each armband has a $1 activation fee.

Armbands are not recommended for children shorter than 36 inches since there are a limited number of rides they can ride.

People who are shorter than 48 inches — and parents of children shorter than 48 inches — should check the ride requirements online before buying armbands. Several rides require children between 42 and 48 inches tall to be accompanied by an adult.

Separate tickets are required for the Sky Eye Wheel billed as North America’s largest traveling Ferris wheel. Each ride on the Sky Eye Wheel is $7.

But the state fair is offering several ways to save on tickets rides and more.

The company asked workers to return three days a week in the office. Read more

Comcast employees trooped back to Center City this past week as part of the company’s national “return to office” policy.

On Thursday at lunchtime the food court underneath Comcast headquarters buzzed with a back-to-school vibe with workers waiting in line at restaurant counters and Cafe Click restaurant’s outdoor tables full. Sunseekers snagged the public chairs on the plaza between 1700 and 1800 JFK Boulevard and the Vernick cafe in Comcast Technology Center seated lunchgoers who hadn’t seen each other in person in months or even years.

The return of Comcast employees to the office signals a noteworthy moment in Philadelphia’s pandemic recovery bringing thousands of people back into Center City after more than two years of working from home.

‘Loosey-goosey vibes’

A corporate memo sent to Comcast employees in August said all staffers — including the 8000 who work in Comcast’s two Philadelphia towers — were expected to work in person on Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays.

In practice it’s more flexible.

One Comcast user experience engineer who works in the Comcast Technology Center described the return-to-office policy as “fairly relaxed.”

“My boss told us that we’re flexible. Our team is flexible. We’re not going to be here all the time” said the engineer who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The engineer said the team is expected to be in the office for larger meetings or to collaborate with other teams but “the vibe I got was loosey-goosey. We’re supposed to show face a few times a week or a month but no one’s getting fired” for not coming in.

Reviews on Glassdoor the first week of return-to-office showed not every Comcast employee is happy about in-person work. At least one person who said they were a senior manager based in Philadelphia wrote that one downside of working at the media giant included “making everyone return to office for no reason.”

The campus is starting to return to a post-pandemic normal and a spokesperson said “We’re being very flexible. We want to work with employees to understand their situation to get back into the office.” Comcast wouldn’t say how many employees returned this past week.

Packed parking garages more SEPTA riders

In recent weeks more employees have been commuting back into Center City.

Placer.ai found a steady increase in workers returning to Philadelphia throughout 2022: August nonresident workers increased to 56% of the 2019 level up from 53% in July. The highest numbers occur on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday when some have designated days to work in offices. Placer.ai estimates the daily population in core Center City based on anonymized mobile phone location data with separate estimates for the number of residents workers shoppers and tourists who are physically present.

Concessions giant Aramark said all employees are now “fully back” in the office at its new 2400 Market St. headquarters. The company said its approximately 900 employees are working “here in our headquarters. And no mandated days we’re a full work-from-office company” according to a spokeswoman.

FMC Tower across the river has approximately 500 employees working at the chemical company and finished bringing everyone back to the office in mid-July 2021. “We have a two-day-a-week flex allowance that many of our employees use to work from home so our actual in-office population varies day to day” said a company spokesperson in an email.

But Comcast’s return had an immediate impact.

Robert Zuritsky head of Parkway Corp. which owns thousands of parking spots downtown said commuter garages in Center City were packed this past week “and people who work from home in the suburbs are also coming in Fridays to go to dinner or a show or meet friends.”

SEPTA’s ridership also increased by approximately 5% to over 476000 one-way trips the week ending Sept. 14 said spokesman Andrew Busch. That’s still about half of pre-COVID levels.

“As far as going back to work in person we’re seeing customers in the multifamily apartment buildings especially developers retrofitting buildings so people can work-play-live at home” said 215Secure head Dave Pearson citing 1001 South Broad and Washington Avenue a Post Brothers development as one example. “That’s the model for the two days that people work from home while working in office three days.”

Looking ahead

On Wednesday representatives from Center City District a membership organization and lobbying group for downtown employers were in Comcast’s lobby to hand out information about Restaurant Week discounts to theaters and museums and other perks to employees — some of whom had not been downtown in over two years.

Early data from Center City District show an increase in people walking around downtown likely thanks to Comcast’s return. Foot traffic on the 1700 block of John F. Kennedy Boulevard on Sept. 13 totaled just over 8000 people according to the Center City District pedestrian counters. That’s up 24% from August and nearly double that of January.

Comcast employees’ return “is a significant impact” said Paul Levy president of the Center City District. “It’s great they’ve come back. It’s important to set the standard” for other employers.

Levy said others will take their cue from Comcast.

“Once one major employer starts to come back those who haven’t can see what’s worked and hasn’t worked” he added.

Still whether more employees will return to offices or not will be clearer in the coming weeks and months said one recruiter.

“It’s been a mixed bag” said Sulaiman Rahman president of DiverseForce a recruiting firm. “We are seeing more companies ask employees to return to office for certain days of the week but we are hearing from more and more candidates that they cannot see themselves going back to a traditional commute to the office” Rahman said. “It will be interesting to see if companies can pull this off without paying a price through turnover.”

Among smaller companies the family-owned investment firm Prudent Management Associates recently moved office space for their 12 employees. Their new address at Two Commerce Square 2001 Market Street has a smaller footprint than at their 1735 Market Street offices. “Smaller offices less money” said Fred Snitzer managing director at the 40-year-old company.

“We think we have made some significant improvements such as signing a new 10 year lease in center city and moving offices for the first time in 30 years” he said. The investment firm has about $1 billion dollars under management.

Other employers including tech companies have chosen to remain hybrid by design such as tech companies.

SageFrog Marketing transitioned to a hybrid work model in 2021 allowing employees to work remotely from home or in its Doylestown office. To help alleviate expenses chief executive Mark Schmukler said the marketing firm offers a monthly stipend to all employees for gas or any work-from-home expenses such as cell phone bills WiFi and office supplies.

“We don’t plan on changing our current policies due to the gas inflation because it’s our employees’ discretion if they would like to work in the office” said Schmukler.

Hybrid work offers an edge when hiring he added. “Our hybrid work model is here to stay as it will allow us to expand our radius for top talent.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXpuLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9uZXdzL2JveGluZy9jYW5lbG8tdnMtZ29sb3ZraW4tMy1ob3ctdG8tcHVyY2hhc2Utb24tZGF6bi1wcHYtdmlhLXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXhib3gtbGctd2ViLW9zLXNhbXN1bmctdGl6ZW4tY29tY2FzdC12aXppby1wYW5hc29uaWMveDA1MWdla29yeXZvMTcwdWZicnE1dDIxetIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canelo vs. Golovkin 3: How to purchase on DAZN PPV via Playstation XBox LG Web OS Samsung Tizen Comcast ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dazn.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en-US/news/boxing/canelo-vs-golovkin-3-how-to-purchase-on-dazn-ppv-via-playstation-xbox-lg-web-os-samsung-tizen-comcast-vizio-panasonic/x051gekoryvo170ufbrq5t21z (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395168BFA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXpuLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9uZXdzL2JveGluZy9jYW5lbG8tdnMtZ29sb3ZraW4tMy1ob3ctdG8tcHVyY2hhc2Utb24tZGF6bi1wcHYtdmlhLXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXhib3gtbGctd2ViLW9zLXNhbXN1bmctdGl6ZW4tY29tY2FzdC12aXppby1wYW5hc29uaWMveDA1MWdla29yeXZvMTcwdWZicnE1dDIxetIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwOS85MTQzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Would Universal Buying Warner Bros.

Superb and convenient cocktails to satisfy the most discerning palates are now the crack of a pull tab away. Jeffrey Westbrook

It’s the ultimate question. And it has remained unanswered for 42 years.

“How ’bout a Fresca?” Judge Elihu Smails maniacally asked Danny Noonan in Caddyshack. Before the caddie could respond however Smails vigorously tousled Noonan’s hair to cement their “understanding” and the scene was over. So I ask you now Mr. Scholarship Winner: Do you want a Fresca?

Of course you do! And you won’t have to wait much longer to get it the way you truly want it. Constellation Brands — a beer wine and spirits heavyweight — is partnering with Coca-Cola (owner of Fresca) to deliver a grown-up version of what Smails proffered so long ago. In the fall canned cocktails featuring Fresca will hit the market beginning with separate vodka and tequila versions.

“We can’t ignore the fact that we have a passionate fan base within the golf world” says Alex Schultz who is part of the Constellation team rolling out the Fresca canned cocktails. “It makes sense because people at golf clubs have been using Fresca as a mixer for years. Now they’ll just be able to grab a cocktail that’s already perfectly mixed.”

It’s fair to say that pre-made cocktails with genuine spirits are tailgating on the road forged by hard seltzers which themselves are all about a convenient low-alcohol alternative to beer. White Claw and its ilk scratched out nearly $9 billion globally in 2021 and that growth is expected to continue.

For those who savor a well-made full-strength cocktail however a golden age of grab-and-go excellence is just underway — and the people behind the drinks are very aware their approach to mixology has a natural home on the golf course.

That’s certainly the case with Jill Burns and Kelly Gasink sisters who cofounded Austin Cocktails. When they were kids the Dallas-born sisters spent summers at their grandparents’ farm in Minnesota. Grandpop Fred was not a country club fella nor a stereotypical farmer. He enjoyed making divots at the local public course where he played in shorts and Birkenstocks grandkids in tow. At least as important to our tale he also had a tradition on the farm. When the hard work was done the family gathered at 1700 hours for “Cocktail Time.”

“He used ingredients from the gardens and farm in handmade cocktails” says Jill Burns who played on the golf team at Santa Clara University. “When we were kids we joined in with Shirley Temples but when we were old enough to take part in the cocktails we eventually thought ‘We should start batching these.’ ”

Fred’s granddaughters are passionate about the taste of their drinks. Kelly is what’s known as a super taster (that’s a real thing you can test for) whereas Jill says she likes an “alcohol-forward cocktail.” Together they opt for quality over ease. Rather than using a single supplier for the flavors in their drinks they search yon and hither for complementary tastes. The result is legit cocktails that don’t taste like they’re poured from a can.

This summer Austin Cocktails will debut two new tequila drinks. In the meantime try their Fred’s Ruby Red and savor the vodka grapefruit mint and lime mix. And next time you swing through Austin check to see if the tasting room at their spanking new production facility in The Yard is open.

The good news isn’t only emanating from Austin fellow professionals. Longtime readers of Rounds know the Transfusion is a favorite and in Virginia there is a new disciple of the Church of Vodka Grape and Ginger Ale. Turner Lewis is a full-time radiologist but during the pandemic he wasn’t going to the office and his entrepreneurial itch got itchier. Fore Craft Cocktails “is a boot-strap effort at this point” says Turner — but our man is making serious inroads with his Transfusion. New drinks are in the works but as for the mother-ship Transfusion Turner says he had an epiphany during its creation.

“I wanted real flavors” says he. “I didn’t want a 100-calorie drink masquerading as a Transfusion. No moonshine no malt alcohol. I wanted real vodka. I wanted it to taste like a real Transfusion.”

Can I get an Amen brothers and sisters!

Hochul gave elite access —and results — to campaign donors: emails,"Top aides to Gov. Hochul offered boutique access and customer service to elite deep-pocketed donors keen on furthering their business interests in the state a review of emails shows.

The 161 pages of emails show a vibrant buyer’s market for those willing to pony up for the governor’s reelection campaign. So far Hochul has hauled in $34 million for her campaign and is on pace to snag tens of millions more by election day.

In December 2021 Robert Trobe a former deputy commissioner for the city’s Department of Family and Adult Services was in deep discussions with Team Hochul about a campaign fundraiser he was organizing among non-profit organizations. Trobe now serves as vice president at Alliant Insurance Services.

“If we fix the minimum contribution at $250 and get an average per participant contribution of $300 I think we should be able to raise $30000 to $50000” Trobe emailed Mackenzie Wasilick finance chief of staff for Hochul’s campaign committee.

The trove of emails whose content was first reported by the Albany Times Union was obtained by The Post.

But Trobe wanted something in return: Hochul to come out in favor of a cost-of-living increase for state-contracted human services workers who assist New Yorkers combating various forms of addiction.

“What is critical in the run-up to the primary is the Governor’s support for inclusion of COLA in the next budget. … We had a productive initial meeting with [Director of State Operations] Kathryn Garcia” Trobe wrote. “If the COLA commitment from the Governor can be secured it will be extremely helpful in promoting this [fundraiser].”

In her $216 billion budget released in January Hochul made good pledging $500 million for human services cost-of-living adjustments — something Gov. Cuomo had refused to do for every year of his tenure The Albany Times Union reported.

Both Trobe and Garcia did not respond to requests for comment.

In February Trobe personally donated $1000 to Hochul’s campaign. A virtual fundraiser with non-profit community leaders took place on April 18.

“The governor came for a few minutes and spoke to us. It was a 10-15 minutes thing. Took a couple of questions and left” Lilliam Barrios-Paoli a former deputy mayor for health and human services who attended the fundraiser told The Post.

The revelations come as Hochul faces controversy for allegedly helping a contributor tied to $300000 in campaign donations get a $637 million contract from the state for rapid coronavirus tests — charging New Yorkers twice the price other vendors charged.

3 Wayne Chaplin wanted legislation that would require alcohol to be imported to “a licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a premises or warehouse operated by a wholesaler for a period of 24 hours.” John Parra

“In New York State bribery is basically legal. Donors make big contributions to candidates because they want something in return. And these emails show donors are getting special access special treatment and special help from the governor’s staff” said John Kaehny executive director of Reinvent Albany a watchdog group. “It’s probably legal and how Albany works but it’s definitely unethical and wrong. The governor is supposed to serve the public interest not the donor’s interests.”

Wayne Chaplin who attended a different Hochul fundraiser near Rochester in October 2021 was similarly blunt about his needs.

The event was hosted by Rob Sands chief executive officer of Constellation Brands an alcoholic beverages producer and marketer and the largest beer importer in the United States.

The Brooklyn-born CEO of Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirit was angling to find support for a bill that would “require alcoholic beverages imported into New York be first delivered to a licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a premises or warehouse operated by a wholesaler for a period of 24 hours.”

Southern Glazer the nation’s largest wine and spirits distributor would stand to make a killing while critics say the law would make it more prohibitive for smaller distributors and raise costs on consumers.

“See below information that was discussed with the Governor in Rochester” Chaplin wrote to Micah Lasher Hochul’s director of policy in a Dec. 7 2021 email. “I wanted to direct the attached to you as a follow up to that discussion as the Governor asked us to follow up with staff.” He sent along a two page explainer pumping the proposed law.

On the day of the fundraiser five different LLCs — all of which shared the same address with Southern Glazer’s corporate offices in Miami — donated a total of $25000. Campaign laws forbid any single company from donating more than $5000 total in a year.

So far Hochul has not taken a public position on the booze issue. But in the background is her husband William J. Hochul who serves as general counsel and senior vice president to Delaware North a Buffalo-based gambling and hospitality giant with wide interests in the alcohol trade as well.

Southern Glazer’s bill is currently bottled up in the Investigations and Government Operations Committee by its chairman State Sen. James Skoufis (D-Orange County).

“It’s a terrible bill. It’s bad public policy. What other product that consumers enjoy has to first make a pit stop before it gets to retail? The answer is none” Skoufis told The Post. “Southern Glazer they like to cajole they like to try and bribe they like to try and bully … It’s a very self-interested bill.”

Both Sands and Chaplin did not respond to requests for comment.

People close to former Gov. Cuomo said they were surprised by the blatant pay-to-play.

“That’s certainly not how we did fundraising or raised money” said a former top aide. “It wasn’t appropriate to talk state business and that was strongly strongly discouraged.”

Reps for Gov. Hochul denied any implication of impropriety.

“As public servants government staff receive communications from a wide range of New Yorkers on a daily basis. We welcome the views of different advocacy groups on policy issues but every decision is made by the Governor and her team based on what is best for New Yorkers. No donation has any influence on any government decisions and we strongly reject any implication otherwise” said spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays.",,,,,,,,,

Power outages and ""brownouts"" can be both frustrating and inconvenient to wait out. In 2019 Americans nationwide were without power for a cumulative average of 4.7 hours; this according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's annual survey and report (via Cummins). During those outages exactly how many of us went and unplugged our electronics while waiting for the power to return? You may have heard some guidance somewhere at some time advising you to do so during a power outage but the question is is this really necessary and if so why?

It might feel bothersome to run around the house or office disconnecting and unplugging all the devices but it's actually a smart thing to do says Constellation Energy because wavering voltages and surges can damage electronics and appliances rendering them useless even upon full restoration of electricity. Power outages brownouts and surges occur for several reasons including storms grid failure and electromagnetic pulses (EMTs) according to Penny Electric.

With any electric issue always check whether the problem is exclusive to your home or is widespread. As for unplugging your electronics and appliances here's more on that and why doing so is recommended — even if you've been fortunate enough not to experience any damage from past power outages yourself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NjaWVuY2UtYW5kLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXctaW1hZ2Utc2hvd3MtbG9ic3Rlci1uZWJ1bGEtZGF6emxpbmctaW4tcmVkLTgwMDAtbGlnaHQteWVhcnMtYXdheS01Nzk3MzUuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zY2llbmNlLWFuZC1mdXR1cmUvbmV3LWltYWdlLXNob3dzLWxvYnN0ZXItbmVidWxhLWRhenpsaW5nLWluLXJlZC04MDAwLWxpZ2h0LXllYXJzLWF3YXktNTc5NzM1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Image Shows 'Lobster Nebula' Dazzling In Red 8000 Light-Years Away,"A new stunning image has revealed the ""Lobster Nebula"" in a fiery red. The image was taken by the Dark Energy Camera an instrument designed to read secrets of dark energy.

Nebulae are star forming regions made of dust and gas. A nebula is usually found in spaces among stars acting as a nursey for new stars.

Studying dark matter

The Dark Energy Camera is an instrument mounted atop the Víctor M. Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. It is part of the Dark Energy Survey project to find evidence for dark energy. Scientists believe that this invisible force is responsible for the expansion of universe.

While the instrument looks for proof of this dark energy the telescope is able to take some mind-boggling images of the universe - like this one released on September 12.

The Lobster Nebula is pictured in the recent image. It is a star-forming region about 8000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. The image shows a region spread across 400 light-years in which bright young stars are spread over the giant cloud of dust and gas.

NASA

The Dark Energy Camera is aimed for high-performance and NOIRLab claims that it can capture even the faintest sources of light. It can deliver 400 to 500 images every night. Recently it reached the milestone of 1 million individual exposures.

An eyewitness tells TMZ ... Tyler and Alex hit up SOTA Wednesday night in Corona Del Mar for some sushi with friends -- including castmate Polly Brindle.

We're told Tyler and Alex weren't overly intimate but seemed more than friendly -- touching each other as they walked out the bar. Tyler can also be seen sniffing Alex.

Our witness says the two ended the night by strolling down the street side-by-side.

The timing is worth noting -- Tyler was havin' a good time with Alex and co. the day we learned about his split from the ""Pitch Perfect"" star. According to sources close to them the breakup had more to do with distance than the cheating rumors.

Sources close to Tyler a former pro surfer tell us there's nothing going on between him and Alex -- claiming it was just a group of 6 out to dinner.

Alan Alda is reuniting with an old pal from the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.

The Golden Globe winner 86 celebrated the 50th anniversary of his beloved show M*A*S*H on Friday with his costar Mike Farrell and some red wine sharing a photo of the reunion on Twitter.

""Mike Farrell and I today toasting the 50th anniversary of the show that changed our lives - and our brilliant pals who made it what it was. MASH was a great gift to us"" Alda wrote.

Alda recently reflected on the show for the milestone anniversary during an interview with The New York Times.

""Aside from really good writing and good acting and good directing the element that really sinks in with an audience is that as frivolous as some of the stories are underneath it is an awareness that real people lived through these experiences and that we tried to respect what they went through"" Alda explained. ""I think that seeps into the unconscious of the audience.""

Alda who revealed his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease in 2018 previously told PEOPLE the disease isn't slowing him down.

""I'm busy"" he said in 2019. ""I do occasionally do nothing and sit around. But I believe in doing everything in moderation including moderation. So far it's working.""

Here's How,"Costco is a warehouse club that offers discounts on bulk purchases. This can help you cut grocery costs so you can put more money into savings or use it for other financial goals. Costco also has its own brand of products the Kirkland Signature brand which is very popular.

If you want to shop at Costco though you generally must pay an annual membership fee to be eligible to buy items at the warehouse club. But this is actually not the case in every situation. In fact there's one way you can shop at Costco without becoming a member. Here's how.

Could this loophole open the door to Costco shopping without a membership?

If you want to shop at Costco without buying a membership there's an easy way to do it -- if you have a member who is willing to help you.

See if you have a Costco Shop Card you are allowed to come into any Costco location in the U.S. Canada or Puerto Rico and purchase items. And you are also allowed to purchase items online at Costco.com and Costco.ca. You do not have to be a member in order to make purchases at Costco with your Costco Shop Card.

What is a Costco Shop Card exactly? It's just a fancy way of saying a Costco gift card. So basically if you have a gift card to Costco you don't have to be a member to use it and you can take advantage of Costco's low prices and get access to its beloved Kirkland brand items.

Now there is a catch though. Only Costco members are allowed to buy Costco Shop Cards. So you would need someone who is a current Costco member to buy a gift card for you. And once you had spent the balance on your gift card you would need them to get you another card or to reload your existing one.

Obviously this is likely not a long-term solution since you probably don't want to hassle your friends and family with Costco memberships by asking them to buy you gift cards to the warehouse club all the time (even if you do pay them back). But if you're hoping to just try out Costco to see if a membership is worth it or if you only shop there a few times a year for special purchases then this could be a great option for you.

Should you become a Costco member?

Whether paying for a Costco membership is worth it will depend on many factors including how often you plan to shop at the store and whether Costco's prices on the items you regularly buy are discounted enough to cover the membership fee.

If you're struggling to decide and you know a Costco member who is willing to buy a Shop Card for you this can be a great way to test out whether membership is worth paying. You can get a chance to shop at the warehouse club with this approach in order to see if becoming a long-term customer is the right choice for you.

Across the nation the cost of food is on the rise; in fact we haven't seen these kinds of markups since the late 1970s. Although inflation appears to be slowing down it's not as though groceries will just magically get cheaper than they are at present.

Find Out: This Credit Score Mistake Could Be Costing Millions of Americans

A great way to save on food (and avoid waste) is to buy it frozen. Most every supermarket and big-box store has an ample array of frozen foods but the best place to buy such items is at the retail giant that needs no introduction: Costco.

GOBankingRates talked with Julie Ramhold consumer analyst at DealNews.com to find out the eight best frozen items to buy at Costco.

Sam's Club

Eggo Waffles

""At Costco a box of 72 will cost around $12 which works out to about 17 cents each"" Ramhold said. ""Shopping elsewhere you could pay as much as $7.75 for a box of 24 which comes out to 32 cents each. That means Costco is almost half the cost of other stores.""

Costco

Petite Cuisine Mozzarella Sticks

""These are a great thing to keep on hand for late-night snacks or quick game-day foods and Costco has a 5-pound box of them for $17.48"" Ramhold said. ""Other stores charge around $14 for 3.25 pounds -- that works out to $3.50 per pound at Costco vs. $4.40 per pound elsewhere.""

Costco

Kirkland Signature Three Berry Blend

""If you like smoothies this bag of mixed berries is an excellent thing to keep in your freezer"" Ramhold said. ""Costco has 4-pound bags for $16.39 while other grocery stores will have 3-pound bags for $15.49. That breaks down to $4.10 per pound at Costco vs. $5.16 per pound elsewhere.""

Shutterstock.com

Kirkland Signature Organic Strawberries

""If you prefer just strawberries Costco has you covered there too"" Ramhold said. ""A 4-pound bag will set you back $12.78 while elsewhere you can expect to pay around $4.77 for just 10 ounces. That breaks down to 20 cents per ounce at Costco vs. 48 cents per ounce at other stores.""

Costco

Kirkland Signature Italian Style Beef Meatballs

""Get 6 pounds of these for $21.85 at Costco -- they're good to keep on hand and can be added to things like pasta for a quick dinner whenever"" Ramhold said. ""Other grocery stores charge around $11 for about 2 pounds which means you'd pay 34 cents per ounce compared to 23 cents per ounce at Costco.""

Costco

Beyond Burger Patties

""If you're looking for plant-based beef alternatives Costco is a great place to look"" Ramhold said. ""A 10-count package of Beyond Burger patties will cost around $16 at the warehouse club; elsewhere you'll pay closer to $6.53 for just two patties. Costco's deal works out to $1.60 each while other stores are $3.27 each making Costco an easy winner here.""

Story continues

Walmart

Impossible Burger Patties

""If you prefer Impossible over Beyond Costco has those too"" Ramhold said. ""Pick up an 8-count pack of Impossible patties for around $12.67 at Costco or $1.58 each. Elsewhere you'll pay $6.63 or more for just two patties which works out to $3.32 each. Again Costco is a clear winner for meat alternatives.""

Costco

Dr. Praeger's Organic Veggie Burgers

""Speaking of meat substitutes Costco has a 12-pack of these organic veggie burgers for around $12.77 -- or $1.06 each"" Ramhold said. ""Elsewhere you can get a 2-pack for about $6.41 which breaks down to $3.21 each. Once again Costco is a clear winner.""

In a recent Instagram post Queenie shared a price tag trick so shoppers can save even more at Costco.

The price tag hack

Price tags hold more information than you may realize.

For example Queenie said that if a price ends in .99 that means the amount is usually full price.

However if the price ends in .97 then it's a clearance item and was most likely marked down from its regular price

Lastly if the price ends in .00 or .88 this means that a manager marked it down.

This typically indicates that an item has been heavily discounted and Costco is trying to get rid of the product.

More Costco hacks

Another important trick to consider while shopping at the large chain is to look for asterisks.

If you see an asterisk on the price tag make sure to grab it.

That's because asterisks indicate that your Costco location will not be restocking that particular product.

As a result the item in question is probably marked at the cheapest price.

Another great way to save on products specifically wine is to shop the Kirkland brand as they're usually half-off or more.

Plus many times the brand name you want is just slapped with a Kirkland label so you're in fact getting a high-quality wine made by top wineries exclusively for Costco.

Another way to save is to take advantage of its cheaper gas prices.

Prices could be anywhere from $0.10 to $0.40 per gallon cheaper at the retailer.

The wholesaler is also known for saving shoppers at least 15% on different restaurants or movie tickets when you buy gift cards at its store.

It offers gift cards for steakhouses and other fine dining BBQ burger joints coffee shops ice cream parlors streaming subscriptions and even gift cards for the spa.

User Chad (@chaadcrb) typically posts content about his job at Costco showcasing hypothetical scenarios he experiences on the clock. In this viral video with over 828000 views Chad records his reaction after seeing his co-worker on social media.

“When you see your quiet coworker on ur story and see how she act outside of work” he wrote in the text overlay making a shocked expression as he pretends to watch a wild Instagram story on his phone.

In the comments some viewers claim to be the quiet coworker in question who acts completely differently outside of work.

“Everyone was shook when they saw the real me outside of work” one user said.

“I ain’t the same person at work & oustide fr” a second stated.

“It’s my coworkers be snitching that’s why I’m quiet” a third wrote.

Others used the video to voice their opinions on sharing their social media accounts with co-workers.

“This is why I lie and say I don’t have ig at work I don’t need them knowing who I really am” one person commented.

“I don’t add my coworkers on NOTHING I don’t need them telling my business to NO ON” a second said.

“That’s why I like blocking my coworkers No need for them to know the truth” a third shared.

Most people have a social media account with 98% using it for personal use. However there is a large fraction of people who are connected with colleagues on social media. According to a 2020 report from ZDNet 74% of people are connected with co-workers on social media.

There are plenty of downsides to following co-workers on social media. 72% of people refrain from posting certain things on social media for fear of co-workers seeing them per ZDNet. 52% feel left out when they see photos of co-workers spending time together outside of work.

The Daily Dot reached out to Chad via TikTok comment."

The location was the Villa Castillo de Mallorca mansion in Cala Racó Puerto Andratx which represents the Castle of Santa Teresa in Saint-Tropez owned by the Al Fayed family and the last refuge for Diana and Dodi before their deaths in August 1997.

The first day's filming involved the actor Khalid Abdalla who plays Dodi Al Fayed in the Netflix series. Sequences were shot of him in various parts of the mansion and its grounds such as the garden and by the pool.

Filming in Mallorca will continue until October. Locations will include Formentor and Palma while there will also be scenes at sea - Dodi and Diana (played by Australian actress Elizabeth Debicki) on board what will represent the yacht Jonikal."

For all of their unique attractions none of them has been without irritation. So none of them have been big sellers. Which makes you wonder how thirsty Britain will be for this one the C5 X. Which is a pity because it's actually quite good and ploughs a unique furrow compared with the relentlessly sport-obsessed German opposition. In technical terms it might not be as revolutionary as some of those forebears but the non-conformist body more than makes up for it. Look carefully and you might even spot some cheeky nods to Citroen's quirky Eighties heyday.

But what actually is it? There isn't really an answer to that question. In some ways it's a big hatchback except the tail end is longer and there's no loading sill so you could use it as an estate. The body is raised up slightly like a crossover's and there's a bit of lower body cladding. But the roof isn't as high as a crossover's and the drag and weight are lower. It's also quite hulking in the metal. So it's a bit of many things but not wholly anything except Citroen thinks a new thing. So does it look a bit of a mongrel? It's a confidently handsome thing. For sure it doesn't look like anything else. You wouldn't say 'there's an estate' or 'there's a crossover'. The face allows it to be recognisable as a modern Citroen while the interestingly shaped arches and floating roof give some intrigue to the side profile. The rear end gets more LED lights and no fewer than two spoilers. For those interested the drag coefficient is an impressive 0.29.

Is it a boat to drive? Despite the height and softness the C5 X doesn't go all Marie Rose at the first corner. Not at all. The steering's really well done and roll is well checked. It manages to feel both substantial yet light – especially the three-cylinder petrol one. Whatever you look for in your car Citroen is to be applauded for offering something a bit different and we like how the C5 X quite overtly focuses on comfort and does it well. It encourages you to be smooth and progressive with your driving to get the best out of the set-up.

And of course the powertrains are pretty critical to the experience here. There are two petrol engines – one with 128bhp and one with 178bhp – both exclusively available with eight-speed auto gearboxes. They're straightforward and pleasant enough and they let you bowl down a B-road pleasantly enough. There's also a plug-in hybrid which does miracles for fuel economy on short trips and BIK tax and gives you lovely silent urban electric running. But on curvy roads it casts a miserable shadow on throttle response gearchange strategy and braking progression. Don't say we didn't warn you. Click through to the driving tab for more. How much will it cost me? In the UK prices start at £27790 for the base spec petrol-powered C5 X. That puts it in the ballpark of a fair number of estate and crossover rivals although it is a lot of car for the money. Top-end is the fully-loaded PHEV at £39960. If you’re worried about depreciation (it’s a big Citroen so of course you are) then Citroen points to its much improved residual values. It claims that from January 2021 to June 2022 it improved its residual values across its range by 17.3 per cent. That was apparently compared to an industry standard of 11 per cent in the same period so whatever Citroen you’re running it should hold its value better than before. Will the C5 X be the same? Only time will tell. What are its rivals? Good question. Citroen does quote a few – things like the Mazda 6 Tourer the Skoda Superb Estate the Volkswagen Arteon Shooting Brake and the Genesis G70 Shooting Brake. And that’s before you enter the world of many crossover options in the same price bracket.

What's the verdict? “ When you look at what people might own – a big estate or crossover most likely – the C5 X is fine value ”"

Palm trees near the Hollywood Bowl caught on fire Saturday evening as an audience was leaving the venue following a Sound of Music sing-along concert.

Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) responded quickly to the scene and posted an update on Twitter writing ""We're pleased to say the @HollywoodBowl is not endangered and no injuries have been reported.""

""A trio of @LAFD fire companies are on scene handling"" the organization continued.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O 0.70%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

With its 4.4% dividend yield and monthly dividend payouts investors in search of passive income can't go wrong with Realty Income stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9raWRzLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXZhY2NpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parents hesitate to give kids under 5 covid vaccine worrying health officials,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.washingtonpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /health/2022/09/18/kids-coronavirus-vaccine/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394F8C7250>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9raWRzLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXZhY2NpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53d2Vlay5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3d5ZGVuLWJsdW1lbmF1ZXItYW5kLXRoZWlyLXdpdmVzLW1hZGUtc3RvY2stdHJhZGVzLXRoYXQtcmFpc2UtY29uZmxpY3Qtb2YtaW50ZXJlc3QtcXVlc3Rpb25zLW55dC1zYXlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wyden Blumenauer and Their Wives Made Stock Trades That Raise Conflict-of-Interest Questions NYT Says,"Conventional wisdom in personal finance is that working stiffs with a 401k plan should stay away from individual stocks and just buy mutual funds that track broad market indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500.

Unless you’re a hedge fund manager or you have money to burn that’s your best bet most financial planners say. Individual companies can crater just as often as they soar and the risk is just too great for nonprofessionals.

Many members of Congress ignore that advice even if they handle legislation that affects companies’ fortunes. That causes both conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflict. Neither is good.

After a few high-profile cases of legislators making well-timed trades based on government information about COVID-19 (we’re looking at you Richard Burr) The New York Times this week gave congressional trading the full data-dive treatment examining trades for every member between 2019 to 2021.

They found 97 legislators out of 535 with dicey deals done by themselves or by family members including two of Oregon’s longest-serving Democratic leaders: U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer.

Wyden made the list because his wife bought and sold shares of Exxon Mobil and Shell while he sat on committees that handled energy issues the Times said. Wyden also made trades in companies run by executives who testified before the Senate Finance Committee while Wyden was the top Democrat on the committee the Times said.

A spokesman for Wyden told the Times that he and his wife keep their finances separate.

Blumenauer made the list because of trades by his wife too the Times said. She traded shares of CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group both of which offer Medicare Advantage plans. Blumenauer sits on the House Ways and Means Committee which has authority over Medicare the Times reported.

Blumenauer himself purchased stock in defense company Raytheon on Feb. 24 the day Russia invaded Ukraine the Times said. He sold the shares on March 14 the Times said. Among other weaponry Raytheon makes the Tomahawk cruise missile.

The trade was the result of a “miscommunication” Blumenauer’s office said.

”The congressman has long believed that members of Congress should not trade individual stocks” a Blumenauer spokesperson told the Times. “Due to a miscommunication his financial advisers purchased some stock on his behalf. When this was reported to him he immediately ordered it sold (at a loss) and gave unequivocal direction that he should not hold any individual stock.”

Recent filings show that Blumenauer’s wife still owns stock the Times said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYW5rbGVyLmNvbS9wL2hvbGx5d29vZHMtem9sb2Z0LWJsb3ctb2Zm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hollywood's Zoloft Blow-Off - by Daley Haggar,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYW5rbGVyLmNvbS9wL2hvbGx5d29vZHMtem9sb2Z0LWJsb3ctb2Zm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394F8C6170>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Most people didn't follow the rules and just named one restaurant while other people named closer to 10 restaurants. Nevertheless it's the thought that counts and the 100-plus comments offered some insight into the chain restaurant ""Wish List"" for Milledgeville.

Here are the five restaurants that were named at least five times:

1) Red Lobster – 21

2) Panera Bread – 19

3) Olive Garden – 16

4) Cracker Barrel – 9

5) Golden Corral – 6

Milledgeville-Baldwin County currently has just one sit-down seafood restaurant – Down South Seafood. Although really tasty Down South Seafood is only open on Friday and Saturday evenings and plus it's pretty far out in the boonies. This would probably explain much of the clamoring for Red Lobster.

There's always been the theory that Red Lobster ""only opens in towns with an interstate."" Dublin for example has a Red Lobster located off of Interstate 16 and Laurens County only has a few thousand more people than Baldwin. Plus Laurens doesn't have the legions of college students from suburban Atlanta with seemingly endless disposable income.

CLICK HERE to meet the Williams ""family""

So is it true that Red Lobster only open in ""interstate towns?"" Is it company policy? Well based on the map of Red Lobster locations in Georgia there's no hard-and-fast rule about opening solely in interstate towns although the overwhelming number of Red Lobster locations in Georgia are located along an interstate (see screen grab below). All totaled out of the 20 Red Lobsters in Georgia only two are not in interstate towns – the one in Albany and the one in Athens. Albany has the 10th largest population of Georgia cities and Athens the fifth.

The same generally is true for Olive Garden which received the third-most votes in the Baldwin2k poll. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were part of the same corporation up until 2014 – Darden Restaurants. Although the two restaurant chains are no longer in the same family Olive Garden follows the same pattern. Out of the seven Olive Gardens in Georgia two are not interstate towns – Albany and Waycross. The population of Waycross/Ware County actually is smaller than the population of Milledgeville/Baldwin County.

So for anyone holding their breath for a Red Lobster or Olive Garden in Milledgeville Olive Garden likely is more likely to happen based on the fact that there's a location in Ware County which is smaller than Baldwin County and likewise not located along an interstate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the models the 1500 Laramie G/T and 1500 Rebel G/T were added just this year.

Enriching the Ram 1500 features are color options with 15 exterior shades from which to choose.

While the Ram 1500 line offers a wealth of creature comforts with these trucks it's all about work. For example Ram brags of having the most powerful half-ton diesel pickup on the market (480 foot-pounds of torque). The line also features a maximum 12750 pounds of towing capacity and 2300 pounds of payload.

Historically the Ram half-ton diesel rivals the power output of early 1970s diesel versions of three-quarter-ton trucks.

The riding and handling of the 2022 is also enhanced with an industry segment exclusive link-coil rear suspension system with optional four-corner air suspension.

Chief among the truck's innovative features is the Uconnect 5 system that employs a 12-inch touch screen offering split-screen capability 360° camera views and content from SiriusXM. Active safety and security systems include adaptive cruise control forward collision warning blind-spot monitoring and Ready Alert Braking.

The 2022 configurations both for two- and four-wheel-drive trucks include a Quad Cab (6.4-foot bed) or Crew Cab (5.7- or 6.4- foot bed).

Class-exclusive features include the RamBox cargo management system relocatable anchor points in the bed and a new multifunction tailgate that includes a center bed step.

Videos by American Songwriter

The homage saw his friends colleagues and family play tribute to his cherished discography as well as a career retrospective that put his enormous legacy in perspective. The trip down memory lane for Gill prompted us here at American Songwriter to do the same. Below we’re going through just 8 of a book’s worth of iconic Gill tracks that are loved by the country community and the world over.

1. “Don’t Let Our Love Start Slippin’ Away” (from I Still Believe in You)

“Don’t Let Our Love Start Slippin’ Away” is a particularly catchy gem from Gill’s catalog. Released in 1992 the track is a waltzing appeal to his lover to keep their relationship intact. Despite being a little beat down in the lyrics the rest of the song is infectiously upbeat. With Gill’s soaring vocals and that incredible melody it is hard to shake this one once you’ve gotten a taste.

2. “One More Last Chance” (from I Still Believe In You)

Taken from the same album as “Don’t Let Our Love Start Slippin’ Away” comes this bluegrass-infused track about a wife who has had just about enough of him coming home drunk. In an effort to get a little TLC she hides his glasses and his car keys but she made the fateful mistake of forgetting his “old John Deere.” Playfully disparaging and a foot-stomper to boot there is a good reason “One More Last Chance” has endured as one of Gill’s top tracks.

3. “It’s Hard To Kiss The Lips At Night That Chew Your Ass Out All Day…” (from The Notorious Cherry Bombs)

Country supergroup The Cherry Bombs reunited in 2003 and deemed themselves a bit more “notorious” than their previous iteration. In the group Gill joined forces with his long-time friend and colleague Rodney Crowell among others to record their first official album as a band. Though their one album didn’t see the same success he was enjoying as a solo artist the Cherry Bombs are still a notable stop along our journey through Gill’s career.

As for which song to highlight we’re choosing “It’s Hard To Kiss The Lips At Night That Chew Your Ass Out All Day…” If there is one thing we love it’s a bit of a sly number that appeals to our most unabashed natures and this track is surely that and then some. The video is something to behold as well.

4. “Pretty Little Adriana” (from High Lonesome Sound)

Slowing things down “Pretty Little Adriana” was inspired by a murder of a 12-year-old girl named Adriane Dickerson who was shot outside of a Nashville supermarket in 1995. Gill writes with a deep tact from the parent’s perspective while his warm vocals shoulder the emotional weight. As evident by the first three songs on this list it’s certain that Gill knows how to write a track that gets the blood pumping but he has his fair share of somber notes as well.

5. “When I Call Your Name” (from When I Call Your Name)

Keeping things the same tempo “When I Call Your Name” sees Gill in a similarly dejected state. The song is a certified crooner. It doesn’t get more classic country than this. Singing A note on the table that told me goodbye / It said you’d grown weary of living a lie / Oh your love has ended but mine still remains / But nobody answers when I call your name Gill paints a lonesome picture that is perfect for those quiet nights when you need a little reassurance that someone out there is alone with you.

6. “I Can’t Tell You Why” (from Common Thread: The Songs of The Eagles)

To represent Gill’s time with that little underground band he likes to hang out with from time to time you know – The Eagles – we’re looking at his cover of “I Can’t Tell You Why” from the 1993 tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of The Eagles. Gill’s version of the ballad is a standout from the record and sees the vocalist infusing a good amount of R&B into the track via a Hammond B-3 organ and a saxophone solo. Gill makes the track his own while hanging on to what made it a classic in the first place.

7. “Whenever You Come Around” (from When Love Finds You)

Another slow-burning chart-topper “Whenever You Come Around” is an unrequited love tale of the highest caliber. Beautifully written and impeccably delivered this track has made its way around the country circuit since its release notably with a cover by Willie Nelson for his Band of Brothers album.

8. “Go Rest High On That Mountain” (from When Love Finds You)

Few songs cut right to the heart quite in the way that “Go Rest High On That Mountain” does. This heartbreaking ode to a departed loved one was started by Gill after the passing of his friend and fellow country singer Keith Whitley. He finished up the song after his brother passed away four years later. With harmonies by Ricky Skaggs and Patty Loveless this song is truly an unparalleled tearjerker.

Over the last 37 years she has consistently risen in the ranks at the Atlanta-based carrier including leading more than 20000 Delta flight attendants as senior vice president of in-flight service as well as serving as vice president of reservation sales and customer care where she was responsible for more than 37 million customer contacts across 10 engagement centers in four countries.

Now Ausband is executive vice president and chief customer experience officer at Delta. Needless to say she’s one of the most experienced executives in the travel industry—and an expert at preparing for business travel too.

Ausband recently shared more with Fortune about the must-have items she never leaves home without.

Reliable technology

I started my career at Delta as a flight attendant and picked up some packing habits that are hard to break. One lesson that’s stuck with me all this time is reliability – while I’m not a deep sleeper I didn’t ever want to be late for a trip as a flight attendant. An extra alarm clock was mandatory for me as a backup to my hotel-room alarm clock and a wake-up call. Obviously technology has come a long way since then so I’ve gone from packing a physical alarm clock to ensuring I have my power cords. Now I organize all of my chargers and adaptors in our Someone Somewhere amenity kit; I have one in every bag. And I never leave home without my iPad.

Minimalist packing style

I’m a minimalist when it comes to most of my travel; that’s another habit that has stuck with me from my flight attendant days. I’m usually flying for business so I pack only what I need—whatever I’m flying in gets worn into the evening. There’s no need for extra weight in the suitcase. And hey less weight means more fuel conservation on the airplane too. A set of packing cubes always comes in handy so I can separate out what I need and see it all clearly in my suitcase.

Transitional power suit and sneakers

I truly believe a good pantsuit can function as a suit of armor and it’s one of my favorite pieces to style. But the key here is that it’s transitional. I always pack a suit that can be worn with the same shoes I leave home wearing. Sneakers are my new best friend with suits. I’m definitely getting my steps in during my airport visits and these platform sneakers are typically what you can find me in. They’re functional and comfortable and they dress the suit down enough so that I’m able to wear it meeting customers and colleagues during the day and then grabbing dinner at night.

Breathable workout clothes

I’m sure other road warriors can relate to the struggle of finding time to fit in a workout. I know my own Apple Watch constantly reminds me to close those pesky rings! So now Lululemon running leggings are a staple when packing for any trip business or pleasure. It’s the only item I don’t contemplate. Having comfortable clothes that make me feel good makes the workout that much easier to complete. And thankfully when I don’t get to the workout on the ground I can still get some stretching in onboard with one of our Peloton classes on Delta Studio.

Plane-friendly skin care

Frequent fliers know hydration is key at 30000 feet so another must for me is plane-friendly skin care. We recently brought clean beauty brand Grown Alchemist onboard. They’re helping us stock our Delta One amenity kits with 100% natural cruelty-free plant-based skincare and body products. I’ve become addicted to their Vanilla Watermelon lip balm to keep my lips moisturized throughout travel—it has a permanent place in my carry-on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWNoZWNrZWQtYmFnLWZlZXMtc2t5bWlsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta will soon let you redeem miles for bag fees on many more flights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWNoZWNrZWQtYmFnLWZlZXMtc2t5bWlsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C0310>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Up to this point most flights both over and under this length have received prepackaged snacks or boxed meals but soon we will see a return to plated meals and some additional revisions to the meal service.

What Will My Flight Offer?

Each flight will offer a different service depending on the destination routing and length. In short meal service levels return to mostly pre-2020 offerings.

Delta One

Delta One seats on Delta’s most premium transcontinental routes (New York (JFK) to both Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) among others) has had a return of hot food since June of 2021. This onboard service will continue and there will be little changes in the way it will be presented going forward.

Flights Over 900 Miles Plus Flights to and From Mexico Central America and the Caribbean

This is where the biggest changes will come. Beginning March 1 2022 and continuing out over that week hot food will return to first class.

Some new entrées will be added:

Ginger beer-braised osso bucco

Wild mushroom ravioli

Chicken cacciatore

French bread pizza

Barbecue beef short ribs from Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q (on select flights departing Atlanta)

Some new desserts include:

Ricotta cheesecake

Frozen Greek yogurt with cherry syrup

Strawberry rhubarb and pretzel tart

You can expect an entrée appetizer and dessert on most flights where a meal is offered. Delta tends to serve most meals on 1 tray on normal domestic or local international routes without a Delta One product to allow for easy service and cleanup.

On all meal service flights there was always be a full bar service in first class so you can have your choice of beverage with unlimited refills.

Flights Under 900 Miles

For now flights under 900 miles will contain a full drink service and packaged snacks.

These snacks include:

Biscoff cookies

Almonds

Rold Gold pretzels

USDA-certified organic bars from Kate’s Real Food (the dark chocolate cherry and almond bar is on offer at the moment)

Final Thoughts

The return of hot food to premium cabins signifies the return to somewhat normal standards of flying and is an exciting improvement to premium cabin passengers and elite customers. Over time we hope more service standards become improved and meals get even better but it’s nice to see some meals return for now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kb3VnbGFzLWRjLTgtaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,63 Years Ago Today The Douglas DC-8 Entered Service,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='simpleflying.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /douglas-dc-8-introduction-anniversary/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C0220>, 'Connection to simpleflying.com timed out.

In recent days consultants from the Italian government’s ministry have been sorting out draft contracts for the final sale of Italy’s national airline ITA Airways. As already known it had been announced on Aug. 31 that it had been chosen by the Italian government to go ahead with an exclusive negotiation with the consortium formed by Certares a U.S. private capital company Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM.

For this reason ITA Airways reopened on September 16 its Data Room which holds the Italian airline’s most confidential documents. Entering was Certares the U.S. fund that is exclusively negotiating and also a group of experts in international shipping routes from the U.S. company Delta Airlines.

According to the Italian newspaper “La Repubblica” the two counterparts have already exchanged drafts of the two final divestment contracts namely the Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) and the Shareholders’ agreement (Sha) which regulates relations between shareholders.

However despite these very concrete demonstrations of interest the general elections on September 25 and the formation of a new government in October are imminent deadlines that should not be underestimated. Certares Delta and Air France-KLM have allowed the Italian state to have 45 percent of ITA’s shares (as opposed to MSC-Lufthansa which would leave no more than 20 percent) meaning the Italian state would retain two of the five board members with broad veto powers over strategic decisions and the ability to appoint the airline’s president. The shareholding structure would then consist of Certares with 40.1 percent Air France-KLM with 9.9 percent and Delta with 5 percent and 45 percent the Italian government as the majority shareholder.

The election of the new Italian government in October represents the deadline for the sale of ITA Airways since if it is passed it would mean having to start over or even blow up the privatization.

Another factor forcing an accelerated timetable is rising fuel prices. ITA Airways about a week ago announced that there may be cash flow problems in November which if not resolved in time will make it impossible to face the coming season.

If fuel prices rise another 20 percent and if the pandemic situation deteriorates further restricting travel and thus air travel the matter could become critical. Apparently by December the cash level could fall below the 100 million safety threshold becoming unsustainable. For the next winter season between 100 and 150 million will be needed.

The Certares fund noting the Italian flag carrier’s cash flow difficulties has taken precautions with a “price adjustment” mechanism that is if ITA Airways’ accounts turn out to be less solid it will pay less money for the acquisition.

This week Kingsbridge-based venue Twenty Seven announced on its Facebook page that next Monday September 19 it will be offering special takeaway menus in celebration of the Queen.

While orders have poured in the business has also received a backlash from some people accusing it of profiting from the Queen's death. It has prompted the restaurant to explain that is simply coming up with 'new ideas' to keep the business afloat and to make the day of the funeral even more of a special and memorable occasion for its customers.

Next Monday has been declared an extra national bank holiday so that individuals businesses and other organisations can watch the state funeral which is due to start at 11am at Westminster Abbey in London. Schools will also be closed for the day.

Government guidance states it is up to individual businesses whether they remain open or not and if they give staff the day off. A long list of stores have announced they will be closing ranging from Greggs to McDonald's.

However independent businesses like Twenty Seven which have already publicly shared how it is struggling due to soaring energy bills say it is 'constantly' fighting to financially keep the restaurant's doors open. Twenty Seven is owned by award-winning chef Jamie Rodgers.

It's name comes from the age Jamie was when the restaurant opened five years ago. Since Covid Jamie has publicly shared how the business has had to contend with recruitment issues and having its electricity bills soar almost three times higher than pior to the coronavirus pandemic.

Next Monday Twenty Seven it is offering its customers a Queen's brunch/ luxury afternoon tea priced £25 which is available to collect between 9am to 3pm. In the evening it is offering a lobster or beef wellington banquet to collect from 5pm to 8pm priced £50 per person.

Within 24 hours of announcing the menu on Facebook it had received orders for nearly 100 boxes but it was not all good news.

Jamie posted on the restaurant's Facebook page yesterday: ""We also had a few emails from people being rather unkind saying we were trying to profiteer off such a sad day and we should close to pay our respects to the Queen. Anyone who actually knows 27 will realise we are here for the customer not just for profit.

""In lockdown we regularly dropped off a £10 roast dinner to East Prawle to a lovely elderly lady who now comes in every week for lunch. When KFC/ McDonald’s closed we fought right through diversity to bring people food that they craved but couldn't readily get hold of.

(Image: Twenty Seven)

""I'm now constantly trying to come up with ways to give people affordable access to a fine dining experience through this financial crisis. It will only be me and Claire working that day anyway.

""We’ve just got back from a short break away and the idea came to us around the pool when Claire said 'let’s make afternoon tea and watch the Queen's state funeral'. I said 'if I’m making it for us I may as well make it for everyone.'

""We truly meant no harm or offence. Thank you to everyone who purchased the boxes; we can all raise a glass together with a luxury picnic.

""We were just trying to offer a service as it seems everyone else is shut which we completely understand but with nine bank holidays already this year we do have bills to pay and I need to keep my business afloat in these troubled times. That's why I'm constantly trying to think of new ideas to keep my doors open.""

Jamie has confirmed that the takeaway service is still going ahead and that the post received 170 likes in three hours. He said: ""We decided to open Monday and do a Queen's afternoon tea so people can eat while watching funeral. Lots through it was a good idea but some emailed saying it’s not a good idea.

""One email said 'shame on you for taking commercial advantage on this sad occasion'. When I first got the emails I thought a lot of people would be negative but everyone on Facebook has backed us up and some have even ordered on the back of it.""

Identifying PII data and other sensitive information in flight the new SNS feature leverages pattern matching machine learning models and data protection policies to simplify data protection and compliance in applications that exchange high volumes of data.

One of the first managed services on AWS SNS uses the publish/subscribe model for delivery of messages supporting both standard and FIFO topics. For standard topics only owners can now enable message data protection to scan messages in real-time for sensitive data and provide detailed audit reports or block the message delivery. Otavio Ferreira senior software development manager at AWS and his team explain:

With message data protection for SNS you can scan messages in real time for PII/PHI data and receive audit reports containing scan results. You can also prevent applications from receiving sensitive data by blocking inbound messages to an SNS topic or outbound messages to an SNS subscription. Message data protection for SNS supports a repository of over 25 unique PII/PHI data identifiers. These include people’s names addresses social security numbers credit card numbers and prescription drug codes These capabilities can help you adhere to a variety of compliance regulations including HIPAA FedRAMP GDPR and PCI.

Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-data-protection-policies.html

Customers can define an audit policy to determine whether any of the systems are inadvertently sending or receiving sensitive data or use a block policy to prevent the delivery. Other supported data identifiers include credentials such as AWS secret access keys and device identifiers such as IP address and MAC address. David Boyne senior developer advocate at AWS tweets:

This is pretty neat. Using policies to detect PII information and audit or block messages in flight is awesome. Great for EDA applications as you scale them in orgs it's so easy to add PII information into messages/events be interesting to see this being used

Discussing possible use cases Ferreira and his team write:

Consider an application that processes a variety of transactions for a set of health clinics an organization that operates in a regulated environment. Compliance frameworks require that the organization take measures to protect both sensitive health records and financial information.

The new CloudWatch metrics MessageWithFindings and MessageWithNoFindings track how frequently PII/PHI data is published to an SNS topic and the amount of sensitive data published to a topic.

Source: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/09/amazon-sns-preview-message-data-protection-sensitive-data-in-motion/

Amazon SNS message data protection is currently available in a subset of AWS regions. The pricing of the new feature is based on the amount of payload data scanned with a minimum of 1KB of message scanning and the amount of audit report data generated: with prices depending on the region message scanning starts at 0.08 USD per GB and audit reporting starts at 0.19 USD per GB.

Yes Hong Kong will lose its status because of its travel restrictions

Hong Kong’s strict Covid-19 prevention strategies have driven foreign businesses away. According to a survey by the city’s European Chamber of Commerce nearly 50 per cent of European companies are planning to move out of Hong Kong.

What’s more many people are debating whether Hong Kong will lose its status as an international financial hub. I think it will unless the government drops its travel restrictions soon.

Most countries have decided to “live with the virus” with people not needing to wear masks even when they go out. But Hong Kong thinks differently and that is hurting us. Under the city’s “3+4” model travellers must undergo three days of compulsory quarantine at a designated hotel followed by four days of “medical surveillance” at home. Besides they will be tested for Covid-19 daily during that period. This is very troublesome so most tourists avoid Hong Kong. Also many major international events in the city have been cancelled.

Some people may think Hong Kong’s Covid-19 curbs are not a problem because of the development of technology. However face-to-face gatherings are different from online meetings. We are not robots. Humans need interaction with their fellow professionals and business partners. A majority of students prefer having physical lessons instead of online classes. I believe it is the same in the adult world.

Hong Kong’s quarantine restrictions have led to a lull in investments in the city and an exodus of talent across financial and many other industries.

With countries such as Canada Britain and Australia opening up new immigration pathways for Hongkongers many young skilled professionals as well as wealthy families are planning to leave their hometown.

Education Bureau rejects survival plans by 2 under-enrolled secondary schools

A total of 140500 Hongkongers had applied for Britain’s BN(O) programme up to June this year and 95 per cent – 133124 people – had been approved. This allows successful applicants and their dependents to live work and study in Britain for up to five years after which they can apply for citizenship.

Also thousands of students have left Hong Kong to study abroad. Teachers are leaving too. I fear for the city’s future.

Hong Kong needs a concrete plan for ending its quarantine requirements if it is to reconnect with the rest of the world retain key talent and maintain its competitive edge as an international financial centre.

No the Hong Kong market is stable and can withstand shocks

Some believe that China’s overhaul of Hong Kong’s political system coupled with the strict Covid-19 restrictions means the end of the city’s status as an international financial hub. Yet more than two years after the introduction of the national security law and with the ongoing pandemic Hong Kong is still a regional hub for international business attracting people from all corners of the globe.

Hong Kong remained third in the Global Financial Centres Index after New York and London even as a series of measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus weighed on the city’s economy.

A Hong Kong government spokesman noted the city’s financial markets have continued to function “in an orderly manner” despite uncertainties from the Covid-19 pandemic. Major global banks and financial institutions including BlackRock and Citigroup remain dominant players in the city. These are signs that the city continues to make progress amid turbulent times.

Face Off: Will a vaccine pass be effective in containing Covid-19?

Hong Kong’s status as a global financial centre has been enhanced since the handover because it is now acting as a bridge between mainland China and the rest of the world.

Beijing’s support is also providing Hong Kong with fresh opportunities to further boost its reputation. Hong Kong can take advantage of the development of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) where new foreign enterprises and talent will be based. The GBA comprises Hong Kong Macau and nine municipalities on the mainland.

While Hong Kong has made good progress it has not always been plain sailing. The city was rocked by the 2019 anti-government protests and now the pandemic.

Hong Kong students head back to school as Covid-19 cases surge

But the Hong Kong market is stable because global investors are confident about its ability to withstand shocks. Hong Kong offers many advantages – it has no capital controls while a fully convertible currency and solid infrastructure make it a top attraction.

Even though Hong Kong is now a part of China the city will still be a top destination for foreign businesses. Being an international financial hub is less about politics and more about efficient management so there is no doubt that Hong Kong is still No 1 in the region.

From what I have seen Hong Kong will remain one of the world’s leading financial centres for years to come.",,,,,,

Inflation has made it hard to buy much with a buck these days.

$1 pizza has disappeared. Dollar stores aren’t dollar stores anymore.

So wouldn’t it make more sense to start paying with $2 bills instead?

“If you had a $2 bill perfect” said Heather McCabe a writer and $2 bill evangelist who runs the blog Two Buckaroo chronicling her spending with twos and other people’s reactions. “It’s a very useful thing to pay for a small amount.”

Yet the $2 note is the unloved child of paper currency.

It’s considered a curiosity to some and scorned by others in the United States. The myths around the $2 bill — nicknamed “Tom” by fans because it features Thomas Jefferson’s portrait on the front — are endless. Many Americans think $2 bills are rare are not printed anymore or have gone out of circulation.

Wrong.

The Treasury Department’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) will print up to 204 million $2 bills this year based on an annual order from the Federal Reserve System. There were 1.4 billion $2 bills in circulation in 2020 according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve.

But $2 bills account for just 0.001% of the value of the $2 trillion worth of currency in circulation.

BEP doesn’t have to request new $2 bills each year like it does for other bills. That’s because $2 bills are used so infrequently and last longer in circulation. The Fed orders them every few years and works down the inventory.

“Many Americans have pretty dubious assumptions about the $2 bill. Nothing happened to the $2 bill. It’s still being made. It’s being circulated” McCabe said. “Americans misunderstand their own currency to the extent they don’t use it.”

Bad luck

The United States first issued $2 bills beginning in 1862 around the time the federal government first started printing paper money. Alexander Hamilton’s portrait was on the two until a new series was printed in 1869 with Jefferson.

But the deuce was unpopular and never gained a foothold with the public.

A major reason: The the $2 bill was considered bad luck. Superstitious people would rip off the corners of the bill to “reverse the curse” making the bills unfit to use.

“He who sits in a game of chance with a two-dollar bill in his pocket is thought to be saddled with a jinx” the New York Times said in a 1925 article. “They have been avoided as ill-starred.”

The two was also known for keeping controversial company. It was associated with gambling where it was the standard bet at racetracks and prostitution.

And during the nineteenth century crony candidates frequently used $2 bills to bribe voters. Someone holding a $2 bill was thought to have sold a vote to a crooked politician.

The Treasury Department during the 1900s tried unsuccessfully several times to popularize the use of the $2 bill. In 1966 it gave up and discontinued printing the bills “because a lack of public demand.”

But a decade later as the United States approached the bicentennial the Treasury designed a new $2 bill series with a portrait of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back.

The aim was to cut the number of $1 bills in circulation and save the Treasury money on production costs.

But the relaunch in 1976 failed. People viewed the new version as a collector’s item and hoarded them instead of going out and spending them.

The Postal Service offered to stamp them only on April 13 the first day they were issued in honor of Jefferson’s birthday unintentionally adding to the idea that they were commemorative bills -— a misconception that continues to this day.

“The press and public now tend to link the $2 bill with the Susan B. Anthony dollar under the general heading of ‘fiascos’” the New York Times said in 1981.

There’s no rational reason why $2 bills aren’t as popular as other bills said Paolo Pasquariello a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. But people exhibit a preference for multiples of 1 and 5 he said.

Another reason $2 bills never took off: Cash registers invented in the late 1800s were never designed with a place to hold them so cashiers didn’t know where to stash them.

“There wasn’t an alteration of cash registers for $2 bills” said Heather McCabe. “The infrastructure of paying for things didn’t change. There was not an adjustment of how people work with that bill.”

If cash registers had a familiar slot for $2 bills the bill would be more popular she argued.

$2 subculture

But there are people who swear by $2 bills. In fact communities and subcultures have developed around them.

US Air Force pilots who fly U-2 spy planes always keep a $2 bill in their flight suits.

Since the 1970s fans of Clemson University’s Tigers football team have paid and tipped with $2 bills -— “Tiger Twos” — in other cities’ restaurants bars shops and hotels. The tradition started as a way to prove to Georgia Tech in Atlanta that it would benefit the city to schedule games against Clemson.

“There is a degree of popularity to them. There is a sense of excitement” said Jesse Kraft a curator at the American Numismatic Society. “But as far as putting them back into circulation that’s the key that’s missing.”

Kraft is a proponent of adopting $2 bills more widely.

He notes that it’s about half as expensive for the Treasury to print a $2 bill than higher denominations which come with costlier security features on the paper. It’s also more efficient to print $2 bills than $1 bills because the Treasury can print twice as much for the same amount of money and requires less storage.

John Bennardo who made a 2015 film about $2 bills called “The Two Dollar Bill Documentary” has made it his mission to “educate people and enlighten them and start using $2 bills in their life.”

In short he concludes $2 bills are underappreciated in the United States and a way for strangers to meet and engage.

“You will get remembered if you use a $2 bill” Bennardo said. “It has this ability to connect people in way that other bills don’t. It opens up a dialogue between you and the cashier.”

“It’s a practical bill with inflation. But it’s social currency as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9waWN0dXJlLXJvY2tzLXRvLWdldC1wdWJsaWMtYnVzLXNlcnZpY2UtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMTEzMDFmMC0zNWY5LTExZWQtOGZlYS02N2ZjNTYyMGY2NTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Picture Rocks to get public bus service for first time,"For the first time Sun Shuttle will expand its services and provide public transportation to the Picture Rocks area.

The one-year pilot program will launch on Oct. 24 a news release from Sun Shuttle said. Since at least 14% of the Picture Rocks population has unmet transportation needs community members have spoken up about the importance of public transportation to provide access to social services medical services and employment opportunities.

“The Regional Transportation Authority has listened to residents of Picture Rocks and their call for public transportation” RTA Executive Director Farhad Moghimi said in the news release. “We are interested in working with the community through this pilot project to test the interest in using Sun Shuttle. We encourage residents to provide their input at the upcoming meeting to be part of the process to deliver the best possible service to the community.”

The pilot program will provide service to destinations such as the park-and-ride at the local Dollar General Safeway the Tucson Premium Outlets and connection points to additional transit routes.

“This pilot program is part of our ongoing commitment to providing quality transit service throughout southern Arizona” Moghimi said. “The shuttle service will be open to anyone and will be a great time to try this neighborhood transit option.”

Program managers will use the pilot program to assess the success of the service and evaluate how to best serve the area after the year-long pilot the news release said. The transit fares for the service will remain free through Dec. 31.

Community members are encouraged to attend an input meeting on Monday Sept. 19 as transit planners are working out the schedule and frequency of the new service and need help from the public. The meeting will be from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. at the Picture Rocks Community Center located at 5615 N.

Driver Killed in Multi-Vehicle Crash in Jefferson Davis Parish

Jefferson Davis Parish – On September 17 2022 shortly after 12:00 p.m. Louisiana State Police Troop D was notified of a three-vehicle fatal crash on LA Hwy 26 about a half mile south of LA Hwy 102 in Jefferson Davis Parish.

The crash claimed the life of 75-year-old Larry Andrew Doucett of Hathaway.

The preliminary investigation revealed a 2005 International DuraStar (Forestry Bucket Truck) driven by 40-year-old Alfredo Guilamo of Katy Texas was traveling south on LA 26.

At the same time the driver of a 2017 Hyundai Accent stopped for traffic that had stopped in front of him.

Guilamo failed to stop and traveled into the northbound lane of travel in an attempt to avoid striking the Hyundai.

As Guilamo steered to the left the right side fender of a portable wood chipper being towed struck the rear of the Hyundai.

After the initial impact with the Hyundai the bucket truck traveled into the driveway of Dollar General and struck the left side of a 1999 Chrysler Town and Country van being driven by Doucett.

Both vehicles entered a roadside ditch which caused the bucket truck to overturn and come to rest on top of the Chrysler.

Despite being properly restrained Doucett sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The front seat passenger in the Chrysler who was properly restrained sustained serious injuries and was transported to area hospital for treatment.

The driver of the Hyundai and his passenger were both properly restrained and not injured. Guilamo was properly restrained and not injured.

Toxicology samples were obtained and will be submitted for analysis. This crash remains under investigation.

While this crash remains under investigation inattentive/distracted driving continues to be a leading factor in fatal crashes in our state.

(WJHG/WECP) - One person was reported to have minor injuries after a multi-car crash caused delays on Front Beach Road in Panama City Beach Saturday afternoon.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers said the incident happened around 2:45 p.m. They say a car was leaving the Everything A Dollar store parking lot near the intersection of Front Beach Road and Hinson Avenue.

FHP said a car was turning onto Front Beach Road but failed to yield to another car that had the right of way on the roadway. Troopers report the cars crashed and drifted over into the opposite lanes where they then crashed into another car.

One of the cars did catch on fire but troopers said only one of the drivers was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. They said no other injuries were reported.

Bay County Sheriff’s deputies closed sections of Front Beach Road for safety precautions. We’re told firefighters arrived on the scene and were able to extinguish the fire.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O 0.70%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

Jericho battled the GCW star as one of the “Labors of Jericho” during his feud with MJF and Gage’s use of a pizza cutter at an inopportune moment caused some controversy when the Dominos ad aired right after it.

Jericho talked about working with Gage during the latest episode of Talk is Jericho recounting how he learned a lot about the psychology of deathmatch wrestling from Gage. He also weighed in on the Dominos incident as well and you can see the highlights below:

On working with Nick Gage in AEW: “Nick Gage again like ‘I don’t know who this guy is but he’s f**king insane.’ And then I asked Mox about him [and Moxley said] ‘He’s a teddy bear’ or something whatever he said. And I spoke to him a couple of times and he was super super-respectful. And that goes a long way with me. Like I meet a lot of guys in the business and as long as you have respect for the business I’m cool with you. I don’t care what you do. And when I met him he was so so respectful and really was happy to be there and was kind of ‘Hey man I just wanna tell you like I’m a really big fan of yours and it’s really cool for me to be here. And it was like he just loves wrestling.’ This is the path his wrestling took doesn’t mean he’s any less of a wrestler.”

On learning more about deathmatch wrestling at that time: “I really started learning the psychology of deathmatch wrestling. What possesses these guys to do this? I’m not one of these guys to be like [imitates Jim Cornette] ‘Well that’s f**king bulls**t. That bulls**t stupid mudshow wrestling!’ I don’t look at it that way. I look at it ‘Okay there’s a market for this and these guys are really good at what they’re doing; how are they doing it?’

“So I really watched what he was doing. And I thought like ‘S**t man I’ll do it! I’ll do it.’ There was a time there was a Chris Jericho time period where I would have went ‘I would never get hit with a light tube. That’s stupid! That’s not wrestling that’s bulls**t.’ And once again take head out of ass Jericho. Does it fit the story? Yes. Does it fit the story of the match? Yes. Let’s do it.”

On the Dominos controversy: “That was hilarious. So Nick wanted to do a pizza cutter that’s one of his gimmicks. So right out the gate he slices my arm with the pizza cutter I still have a scar there. And that gets people like ‘Holy s**t! This is real!’ And then during the commercial break he starts slicing my forehead with the pizza cutter in picture-in-picture… So right when Nick is carving my forehead with the pizza cutter there is a Dominos Pizza commercial where the guy is cutting the pizza with what? A pizza cutter! And apparently Dominos was furious.

“And this was ‘AEW is gonna lose all their sponsors and this is it! This is the end of the line!’ Nothing ever happened. I was like if I was the Dominos guy I would have filmed a Chris Jericho/Nick Gage commercial the next f**king day. I mean it’s right there! Pizza cutters Dominos it goes hand in hand!”

Whether it’s a favorite stuffed teddy bear or a plastic action figure there will be no peace at home until your child is reunited with their favorite toy!

A Domino’s Pizza branch in New Zealand recently received a call about a dinosaur toy for this exact reason. When staff members realized they did indeed have “Bitey” the T-Rex in their possession they decided to put him to work!

“Last week one of our stores received a worried call asking to check if ‘Bitey’ the T-Rex had been left in the foyer after his family had picked up pizzas that evening” Domino’s New Zealand wrote on Facebook. “Sure enough Bitey was there!”

They went on to say that it was almost closing time so they told Bitey’s family to pick him up tomorrow. That’s when Bitey rolled up his tiny sleeves and got to work! After getting his very own name tag he learned how to make some tasty pizza.

After getting saucy in the kitchen Bitey got a lesson on phone etiquette and taking orders from hungry customers. He wasn’t very good at dialing the phone on account of his short arms but he turned out to be terrific at making witty banter.

Like any good restaurant worker Bitey took on dishwashing duty that night. We love the cute little cardboard hat they crafted for him too!

After washing up it was back to making pizzas. It’s a good thing Bitey is made of plastic and doesn’t actually eat food or else those pizzas wouldn’t have lasted two minutes. As it is Bitey didn’t eat a bite!

The restaurant reported “… he was sent home with plenty of stories to tell about his first shift at Domino’s the next day.”

We love that this Domino’s crew took some time out of their night to have fun with this child’s toy. Bitey has our vote for employee of the month!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vcmV2aWV3cy90cmllZC1kb21pbm9zLTE2OTktYmlnLWJyZWtraWUtMjUwMTY0NDnSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlcnBvb2xlY2hvLmNvLnVrL3doYXRzLW9uL3Jldmlld3MvdHJpZWQtZG9taW5vcy0xNjk5LWJpZy1icmVra2llLTI1MDE2NDQ5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I tried Domino's £16.99 'Big Brekkie' pizza and it was not what I expected - review,"I've always joked with my friends about how a breakfast pizza should be a thing so you can imagine my reaction when Domino's actually launched one.

The 'Big Brekkie' pizza launched this September and includes toppings such as sausage smoked bacon mushroom and tomatoes with a choice of either brown or tomato sauce depending on what you fancy. It seems like this particular pizza has divided Domino's fans so I wanted to see what it really tasted like.

I'm a huge fan of Domino's pizza so I had really high hopes for the new brekkie addition. I did have a few concerns though was it going to be greasy? Heavy? Would someone even want to eat this in the morning? Let's find out.

The pizza

My local Domino's didn't open until 11am so I skipped breakfast and found myself very hungry by 12pm. I opted for a small pizza since I was on my own and didn't want to be left with loads of pizza if I didn't like it.

My 'Big Brekkie' pizza arrived fresh and smelt absolutely unreal. After toying between tomato or brown sauce I went for the classic tomato and I'm so glad I did.

In terms of aesthetics this pizza looked surprisingly good! It didn't appear out of the ordinary or weird and even the tomato sauce was applied on top in quite a neat fashion.

It included big thick slices of Cumberland sausage and smooth crispy bacon with just the right amount of sauce. The mushrooms were a little slimy but I wasn't expecting them to be perfect because mushrooms can be a hit and miss anyway.

As I took a bite I was surprised at how utterly light this pizza was. When you think of a breakfast pizza you think huge greasy and stodgy but this pizza did everything right.

There was no grease on the toppings and the tomato sauce didn't overpower the pizza which was what I was worried about. The dough was light and fluffy and honestly I can see why people would choose to have this for a weekend brekkie treat.

Don't get me wrong this definitely isn't something you could eat on a daily basis but on a hungover weekend or if you fancy something different it's a great option. The cheese also worked really well with the breakfast ingredients which I was also a little dubious so that's another tick from me.

One thing I will say is the price of this pizza was a little steep at £16.99 for the small and £21.99 for a large. In total with delivery I paid £18.49 for a small pizza which seems rather expensive to me considering you can get a cooked breakfast at my local café for just over a fiver.

I do know that with places like Domino's it's all about the convenience of the delivery and the brand itself though. Since the pizza was actually really good I can let that slide.

The verdict

The toppings were top quality the tomato sauce really complemented the ingredients and the dough was beautifully fresh. I was very impressed.

I'm still so surprised at how light this pizza was which is why I'd definitely order it again. There were so many delicious flavours on the pizza that weren't ruined by the sauce and I'm so glad about that.

One thing I will say though is that if you don't like mushrooms you might have to take them off because they were a tad slimy on my pizza - but personally that didn't bother me.

All I can say is well done for Domino's Pizza for creating this absolute gem of a pizza something that I've actually been wanting for a while and now I've got it. It lived up to my expectations and it's a winner for me.

It is expected to be operational by 2025 and would deliver approximately 120 kilotons per annum (KTA) of advanced recycling capacity.

This and other planned units expected to be constructed in Europe and the United States would collectively add as much as 600 KTA of advanced recycling capacity by 2030. The facility in Böhlen would be the first in Germany.

The project also would make Dow the largest global consumer of circular feedstock for polyethylene production. This is the first facility to be located at a Dow site. The project is targeted for a final investment decision by the end of 2023.

“The project has a series of investments all the way along so by the end of 2023 all contracts are expected to be in place” Marc van den Biggelaar Advanced Recycling Director Dow EMEA & APAC told PlasticsToday.

While the companies did not release financial details Mura announced on June 1 that its partner KBR a science technology and engineering firm made a $100 million investment in Mura to develop multiple new projects worldwide to remove more than one million tons of plastic from global waste streams.

Process uses supercritical steam to convert plastics

As shown in the video Mura's Hydrothermal Plastic Recycling Solution (HydroPRS) advanced recycling process uses supercritical steam to convert most forms of plastics including historically non-recyclable flexible and multi-layer materials back into the original oils and chemicals from which they were made. These can be used to create new “virgin-equivalent” polyethylene-based products that can be used in multiple medical and automotive applications and even for food-contact packaging the company said.

With Mura's process the same material can be recycled repeatedly so it has the potential to eliminate single-use plastics and prevent them from going to landfills or being incinerated. Advanced recycling processes are expected to save approximately 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of plastic recycled compared with incineration the company said. The technology also reduces reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.

Advanced recycling is different from mechanical recycling which shreds only certain types of plastic for recycling.

First plant in UK expected to be operational in 2023

The planned facility in Germany builds on Dow's ongoing collaboration with Mura first announced in 2021 with an initial project to construct the world's first plant using Mura's HydroPRS process located in Teesside UK which is expected be operational in 2023 with an initial 20 KTA production line. The facility that will be co-located at Dow’s plant in Germany would enable a significantly larger capacity for plastic waste and increase the supply of fully circular feedstock to the industry.

Oliver Borek Chief Commercial Officer of Mura Technology said during a video press conference on Sept. 12 that the facility in Germany will have five times the capacity of the Teesside facility. “Teeside is 20000 KTA but that is liquid output which translates to 25000 tons of input. Böhlen is 120000 KTA of output” Borek said.

Dow said there are several advantages of co-locating the advanced recycling plant at its facility. It is expected to significantly reduce scaling costs. In addition it is expected to reduce carbon emissions by minimizing transportation of the product. Plus the gas output from the advanced recycling process can be converted back to plastics so no by-products go to waste.

Dow committed to securing circular feedstocks

""The continuation and growth of Dow and Mura's collaboration is another example of how Dow is working strategically to expand and build momentum around securing circular feedstocks and supporting breakthrough advanced recycling technologies"" said Isam Shomaly Dow Business Vice President for Feedstocks and Commodities.

""We continue to increase Dow's capacity to use recycled content as feedstock and continue to invest in the most effective technology available to enable our circular business model for plastics"" said Diego Donoso President of Dow Packaging & Specialty Plastics. ""The diversification of our feedstock slate and decarbonization of our assets will enable the achievement of Dow's goal of a sustainable low-carbon future and meet strong and growing customer demand for circular polymers. This will be a significant step forward to decrease our dependency on virgin fossil-based feedstocks.""

Mura Technology CEO Steve Mahon added ""Combating the global plastics crisis requires innovative solutions that can drive a circular economy. Mura's collaboration with Dow has led to the largest commitment across the industry to date showcasing the urgency from industry leaders to adopt scalable solutions such as HydroPRS that will transform the plastics industry worldwide. Dow's continued support for Mura Technology has led to a highly financeable commercial arrangement and the deepening collaboration will allow both companies to achieve their stated ambitions in the advanced recycling space.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy90aWt0b2stc2VhcmNoLWVuZ2luZS1taXNpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy90aWt0b2stc2VhcmNoLWVuZ2luZS1taXNpbmZvcm1hdGlvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok's search engine repeatedly delivers misinformation to its majority-young user base report says,"CNN —

When a TikTok user searches the social media app for information on top news stories ranging from Covid-19 vaccines to school shootings nearly 20% of the videos presented as search results contain misinformation according to a research report published Wednesday.

Researchers at NewsGuard a journalism and technology tool that tracks online information searched TikTok and Google this month for information on major news topics such as the 2020 presidential election the Russia-Ukraine war and abortion to compare the misinfomation delivered by their search engines.

TikTok whose users are predominantly teenagers and young adults “repeatedly delivered videos containing false claims in the first 20 results often within the first five” the report states. “Google by comparison provided higher-quality and less-polarizing results with far less misinformation.”

A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNN.

The researchers searched terms such as “mRNA vaccine” and “2022 election” as well as controversial news topics like “Uvalde tx conspiracy.” They analyzed 540 TikTok results and found that 105 videos or 19.4% contained false or misleading claims the report says.

According to the report a search on TikTok for information about politics including the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 2021 US Capitol insurrection often included misinformation as well as references to QAnon conspiracy theories. For example a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results NewsGuard found.

NewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.

TikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.

In response to the NewsGuard report a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation including medical misinformation and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”

TikTok ties to China under scrutiny

TikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines which include misinformation according to NewsGuard’s review.

NewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.

US officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.

Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”

TikTok does not operate in China Pappas said though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.

“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse as a general matter as a platform than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff” Steven Brill founder of NewsGuard told CNN.

Brill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.

“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia. But this takes it so many levels further.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTMvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8xMy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasdaq closes higher on Wednesday as stocks stabilize following massive sell-off,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTMvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8xMy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951200310>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In fact this Parade of Homes is larger than its predecessor with 26 entries that feature 24 home models plus a Showcase Community and the Showroom at Refined Interiors in Suntree/Viera.

Christopher Burton’s Andros is enviably situated in stunning Adelaide a 460-acre gated community of custom single-family homes on oversized homesites ringing Viera’s beautiful Lake Adelaide with elevated lifestyle amenities only moments away. The company operates under the philosophy that a home should make every day feel like a vacation and the Andros certainly accomplishes that goal.

The Andros features four bedrooms four full and two half baths with 4850 square feet and a three-car garage. The expansive game room includes a raised media lounge and a wet bar making it an entertaining showpiece.

Homes start in the lower end of the $30000s at Showcase Community Crystal Bay at the southern end of the county. Builder D.R. Horton offers single-family homes from 1672 to 2601 square feet and that feature three to five bedrooms in one or two floors.

Crystal Bay will include a clubhouse pool and a host of other amenities including bocce and pickleball courts. As “America’s Smart Home” D.R. Horton homes are outfitted with an industry-leading suite of smart home products that keep homeowners connected with the people and place they value most.

“You are always connected to your home whether you are sitting on your couch or thousands of miles away” said D.R. Horton IT director Austin Juarez.

Parade Showroom Refined Interiors offers a one-stop shop for all home design needs with its newly redesigned 6000-square-foot showroom in Suntree/Viera.

The company sells and installs a wide scope of products from flooring cabinetry and stone countertops to backsplashes decorative hardware closet systems LED bathroom mirrors and even kitchen appliances. The end goal was to have one place for clients to go to when remodeling their existing space or building and designing a new one.

The Parade of Homes is possible through the support of sponsors in the industry. The Signature Sponsor this year is US Bank.

“As established members of our community my team feels it is important to help support our valued builder partners in any way we are able” said Scott Cronenberg retail mortgage branch manager for US Bank.

“By stepping up as the lead sponsor again this year we are able to help showcase our community’s best most talented builders.”

Additional sponsors include:

■ Realtor Sponsor: The Ross Group brokered by Denovo Realty

■ Awards Sponsor: Florida City Gas

■ Toast Sponsor: Regions Bank

■ Dinner Sponsors: Atlantic Tile Capritta Appliance & Air Conditioning Island Tile & Marble Truist

■ Luxury Car Sponsor: Mercedes of Melbourne

■ Media Sponsors: Christopher Alan Homes Halco Inc Payne Point Media The Viera Company

■ Hors D’oeuvres Sponsors: MG Interiors Gulf Western Roofing Milwaukee Tools Peay’s Electric

Megan Ross with the Ross Group explains why her company chose to again be the official Realtor Sponsor for the event.

“The Parade of Homes is an excellent way for local builders to showcase their homes and communities to the general public who otherwise might not be aware of their options when looking to build” she said.

“It also gives Realtors a chance to preview homes and communities to stay knowledgeable within their market. In a world so focused on technology and digital marketing the Parade of Homes is a way for builders to highlight what makes them different by utilizing that in-person special touch.”

The self-guided tour is a cinch to navigate thanks to QR codes noted in the Parade magazine available digitally. With a smartphone attendees can scan the location of the entries and obtain driving directions in a flash.

The Parade of Homes is not only a feast for the homebuyers’ eyes but it also offers a chance to become acquainted with builders they can trust to make home dreams into reality.

“Prospective buyers can have peace of mind knowing that the builders in our association follow a code of ethics and are committed to providing the highest quality homes” said Thomas.

Entries in the Parade of Homes are typically open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and from noon until 5 p.m. on Sundays during this self-guided tour. However HBCA recommends calling the specific model home directly to ascertain hours of operation.

THE Archbishop of Canterbury says he cried after hearing the Queen died then raced home from holiday in France.

Justin Welby revealed he shed a tear and the news “caught him off-guard”.

He said yesterday: “I was on holiday in Normandy in France when I received the call from an aide saying Her Majesty had passed away.

It was an extraordinary moment. We drove through the night to get back here for 5am in the morning on Friday.

All we could talk about was what all this could mean and what could happen. How do you begin to describe it?”

He said while visiting queues at Lambeth Bridge: “It’s impossible not to feel emotional when you see these crowds — and when you see the Royal Family dealing with their loss.”

The Archbishop also dropped off supplies for his sister-in-law who had been queuing for 12 hours.

Mary Eaton 66 registrar of Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University said: “As far as Deliveroo drivers go I feel very spoilt having the Archbishop rescue me with breakfast.

It's almost 90 miles away from the coast but a new amusements arcade is aiming to bring a slice of the seaside to a town just over the border from Notts. Jones Retro Amusements opened in Long Eaton's High Street on September 3.

The building was previously a cafe named Fill Ya Face however owners Michelle Jones and husband Terry Jones decided they wanted to bring something different to the High Street. Having owned arcades in the past the married couple changed their cafe to a family amusement.

Mrs Jones said it felt like an end of an era closing the cafe. The 39 year old said: “Everybody that we’ve spoken to has been positive it’s something different.

“We’ve seen all ages come in the weekend is a lot busier with the kids they especially like the glitter and face painting we’ve done a lot of them.

Mrs Jones added: “The high street just needs an injection a bit of life. There’s something for all ages sand pits outside a variety of machines cheap tea and coffee. When there’s quite a few people in it’s a nice feel a good atmosphere.

“It’s just nice to have brought something a bit different a bit of fun. If people ever want to come for a cup of tea and let the kids play.

""It’s been weird we’ve had an arcade before so to be back it’s been very strange. I think the day we swapped it all over felt like the end of an era. We have been open for three years.”

The ‘Skeg Vegas’ amusements is open from 8.30am until 6pm every day of the week. Mrs Jones also spoke of the struggles of running the cafe in the aftermath of Covid and the current cost of living crisis. She said: “You come in and have a bit of fun without spending. The cost of living is what it is you’ve got to do the best you can. For small businesses they feel it more than the rest with such tight profit margins.

“We were watching the shopping going up the electricity then started looking at staffing costing reduced opening hours. After covid and the living costs it just wasn’t feasible for us to stay open. It’s crazy everybody that you speak to is all in the boat.”

The former cafe has everything from sand pits to 2p machines and teddy bear grabbers face painting and hot drinks. The owners want to give locals something different and something fun.

Mr Jones 43 added: “I had a couple of customers come in and said it’s absolutely unbelievable for Long Eaton it’s something fun.

He adds that they’re almost there with completing the ‘Skeg Vegas’ look. Mr Jones said: “We’re halfway there at the minute not fully there. People have said they love it. We’ve got a few more bits planned”.

Some used wristbands were attracting bids of up to £70000 before they were removed.

An eBay spokesperson said: “These items are against our policies and we are removing them from our site.” Its event ticket policy prohibits the sale of most tickets including those for events that are free to the public.

The Queen’s lying-in-state at the Palace of Westminster opened to the public at 5pm on Wednesday and 48 hours later about a dozen people had listed their coloured and numbered paper bands for sale on online marketplaces.

People joining the queue that winds its way around central London to view the coffin are given paper wristbands to mark their place. This allows mourners to leave the queue for a short period to use the lavatory or get refreshments then return to their spot.

The wristbands which do not guarantee entry and are strictly non-transferable have been issued by the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) to help manage the huge numbers of people keen to catch a glimpse of the Queen lying in state. Bands have different numbers and colours each day. The DCMS website explains the process for queueing saying the band is “a record of when you joined the queue”.

One seller’s gold wristband was listed with the description “Queen Elizabeth II Lying In State Gold Queue Wristband. Used – see photos from the day! Friday 16th September 11-hour queue same day as David Beckham (was about an hour before us). Joined queue before 6am.”



An orange wristband which features the royal coat of arms and the abbreviation LISQ (lying in state queue) had a price of £1000 after nine bids. The seller described it as “brand new” and “never been used”.

A similar band with a starting price of £550 gained 22 watchers in its first 24 hours of being live.

Several sellers are including bundles of commemorative newspapers alongside their bands and many have included photos of themselves wearing the wristband in the queue to prove their authenticity. One eBay member listed his orange band with a note that: “I originally put this wristband at a high price. As you can see it was same colour as my jacket! But have decided to let it run on auction. Something in me from the Queen said do it.”

The cheapest band listed on the site is priced at £10 and for £20 you can buy one described as a “bit wrinkled but a piece of history”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2hvdy1jbGV2ZXItbWVjaGFuaWNzLWtlZXAtNTAteWVhci1vbGQtYmFydC10cmFpbnMtcnVubmluZy13aW5kb3dzLTk4LWViYXktYW5kLXNjcmFwcy_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVyY3VyeW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvaG93LWNsZXZlci1tZWNoYW5pY3Mta2VlcC01MC15ZWFyLW9sZC1iYXJ0LXRyYWlucy1ydW5uaW5nLXdpbmRvd3MtOTgtZWJheS1hbmQtc2NyYXBzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How clever mechanics keep 50-year-old BART trains running: Windows 98 eBay and scraps,"When BART first carried passengers the country was sending astronauts to the moon. The Apollo-era trains were symbols of a generation barreling toward a space-age future complete with carpeted floors and a seat promised to every passenger.

That was 1972 when BART was state of the art. But half a century later as the agency celebrates its 50th anniversary this month many of those same silver-and-blue trains are still chugging through the Bay Area. And keeping them running — even in the country’s technology capital — requires a special breed of ingenuity.

BART mechanics rely on Frankensteined laptops operating with Windows 98 train yard scraps and vintage microchips to keep Bay Area commuters on the rails.

“We have literally started with a picture and scoured different manufacturers and eBay looking for an oddball part” said John Allen a mechanic who specializes in breathing new life into broken down BART trains. When Car 372 caught fire in Orinda in 2013 his team created an entirely new system and built their own tools to replace the floor. “Sometimes we don’t even know what the name of the part is.”

To understand why BART upkeep is so complicated take a look back to the founders. They shunned heavy steel trains and old-school signaling technology and instead hired an aerospace company to build a train fleet that would serve as a new model for public transit. The result? All-electric trains with sleek aluminum bodies and wide windows underpinned by nearly autonomous operations. The price tag for BART’s original 450 cars: $160 million.

“BART was envisioned as a renaissance system” said Mike Healy the agency’s longtime spokesperson and BART historian. In 1972 it “was sort of the new kid on the block.”

But much of the hardware quickly went out of date. Even as Silicon Valley sprouted next door the trains remained tethered to a safe but arcane automated train control system that depended on DOS — a computer operating system now relegated to the dustbin of history — for vital operations. BART inspired train networks in Washington D.C. and Atlanta yet its specific mechanics were never widely replicated.

Today the transit system is an outlier with everything from wheels to windows crying out for custom-built attention.

“The biggest stumbling block is coming up with parts that they don’t make anymore” said Mark Wing a mechanic who oversees maintenance on the entire train spanning electrical propulsion equipment to busted seats.

Which parts are not made any more? “Pretty much everything” he said.

When a BART car runs into trouble Shawn Stange steps back in time. He pops open a circa-2000 IBM Thinkpad running Windows 98 and opens a portal into the train’s brain — the Automated Train Control system — through the DOS computer language.

Much as if he were conducting a vehicle diagnostic test Stange uses the software as a mechanic’s roadmap. “This stuff was written so long ago. So you have to take Windows 10 and open up a virtual Windows 98 box and then run the (DOS) program to download the log files” he said. “It’s primitive.”

Stacks of vintage laptop carcasses are common at BART warehouses. The train software is so old it won’t work on modern computers.

“I was in an engineering office and I bet he had 40 of them sitting on the floor stacked up” said Allen. “Rob this part and rob that part to keep one laptop going. You see that here all the time.”

Perhaps the most illustrative symbol of BART’s go-it-alone approach is its iconic 1970s lead cars which have a dedicated fan base among transit design aficionados. The sloped nose was built for a futuristic effect but had little practical purpose and even prevented the trains from switching interchangeably with flat-faced vehicles. Irrespective of functionality the shape became BART’s “identity” said Healy.

Today 56 of the original lead cars known as A cars are still in operation BART spokesperson Jim Allison said. Their mechanical innards were replaced during a mid-life rebuilding of the legacy fleet starting in the late 1990s but the same pointed nose greets tens of thousands of passengers every day. Another 341 of the trailing “B Cars” from the 1970s are still in use along with 60 “C cars” which were built in the 1980s.

In June the family of legacy lead cars became just a little smaller. Car 1204 derailed and it now lives at the Concord maintenance yard scorching under the most recent heat wave. “It’ll go to Schnitzer Steel in Oakland and get crushed” said Allison.

But before Car 1204 meets the trash compactor mechanics picked through the train’s bones in recent weeks. They pulled headlight sockets and popped out its hard-to-replicate conductor windows to preserve parts.

“The window is kind of bowed out like a bubble” said Scott Fitzgerald a manager at the Concord yard adding that they have just one spare left. “I don’t know how many attempts the glassmaker has tried to get that arc correctly.”

One of the first people to see BART’s space-age trains running through the Bay Area was Mekela Edwards. On Sept. 11 1972 she was a toddler slung over her mother Theresa’s shoulder when the pair became the system’s first paying customers. “Sometimes I introduce myself as BART’s first baby” said Edwards who is now a teacher in Palo Alto.

For her the trains always had an air of discovery on trips from Oakland to San Francisco. But Edward’s connection to BART also parallels many passengers’ love-hate relationship with the system as the dated trains struggle with cleanliness delays and notoriously failing air conditioners.

And as she grew older her frustration with BART sometimes bubbled over into angry social media posts when the crowded old cars morphed into saunas. “I just could not believe it was so hot on the train” she said recounting a trip in 2016. “And so I was tweeting ‘do something about this.'”

Its old trains are being slowly phased out. Most will be sent to the junkyards in the next two years and a handful will be repurposed for among other things a local beer garden video-game arcade and firefighter training. The Western Railway Museum in Solano County is also fundraising to save historic BART cars for a new exhibit.

Taking their place will be the $2.6 billion “Fleet of the Future” which already makes up nearly a third of the trains. The cars have cooler cabins LCD map screens and yellow and blue seats. Along with a revamped train control system the new fleet is meant to finally push BART into the 21st century even as its initial rollout is hampered by software glitches.

Finding replacement parts won’t be a problem and DOS is no longer necessary for Allen and his crew but it will still be bittersweet to say goodbye to trains that they have lovingly kept alive.

“There is a part of me that definitely has a little tear in my eye” said Allen who has dedicated the past 16 years to BART repairs. “I think we could probably rebuild the fleet again and keep it going . . . but you know out with the old and in with the new.”

BOSTON MA—(UPDATED) Patients with severe symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) ineligible for surgery fare just as well when treated with the Pascal device (Edwards Lifesciences) as those treated with MitraClip (Abbott) according to the CLASP IID study.

The results which were presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at TCT 2022 and published simultaneously in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions come just 2 days after the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Pascal transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) system for the treatment of degenerative MR making it just the second device available in the US.

“The CLASP IID trial is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the two TEER therapies and further establishes the safety and effectiveness of mitral valve TEER for degenerative mitral regurgitation patients with prohibitive surgical risk” said study investigator Konstantinos Koulogiannis MD (Atlantic Health System Morristown Medical Center NJ) during a press conference. “It met its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints with the Pascal system demonstrating low composite major adverse events and a significant sustained MR reduction.”

Lead investigator D. Scott Lim MD (University of Virginia Health System Hospital Charlottesville VA) said the introduction of a second device is important as it provides physicians and patients with options.

“The two devices have different design features that I think may be beneficial in different anatomies” said Lim.

For example Pascal’s hollow nitinol-frame construction allows it to close passively and flex during systole and diastole. The device also elongates allowing it to be maneuvered into anatomies with denser mitral chords said Lim. The clasps for grasping the mitral leaflets can be operated in tandem or independently allowing for staged leaflet capture and adjustment and a central spacer helps to bridge the coaptation gap so the leaflets aren’t pulled as tightly together.

Federico Asch MD (MedStar Health/Georgetown University Washington DC) who wasn’t involved in CLASP IID congratulated the researchers saying the field has now entered a new era. “We’ve been building a lot of data with MitraClip as a device but as a composite it’s important to now show that TEER works. There are going to be patients who are better candidates for one [device] or another. I don’t think we have that answer right now” he said.

Speaking with TCTMD Janarthanan Sathananthan MBChB (University of British Columbia/Vancouver General Hospital/St. Paul’s Hospital Vancouver Canada) who wasn’t involved in the study echoed Asch’s comments.

“I think it’s beneficial to have another device to offer TEER as an option” he said. “We’ve seen the struggles that we’ve had with screening for transcatheter mitral valve replacement. We have high exclusion rates so having another device that offers a therapeutic option for edge-to-edge repair is beneficial. CLASP IID also reinforces the benefits of edge-to-edge repair”

Interim Analysis of 180 Patients

The CLASP IID study included 180 patients enrolled at 43 sites in the United States Canada and Europe between 2018 and 2021. Up to 300 patients are planned for enrollment. However interim analyses were planned for 180 210 and 240 patients provided the sample size was deemed sufficient for analyzing the primary endpoint. At 180 patients the interim analysis proceeded because the predictive probability for study success exceeded 96.5% say investigators.

The current analysis included 117 patients treated with Pascal and 63 treated with MitraClip with frailty the most common reason that patients in both treatment groups were ineligible for surgery. Both were well matched but those who received the Pascal device were more likely to have undergone prior aortic valve surgery or TAVI. Two-thirds of patients received the Pascal implant;24.1% received the newer Pascal Ace device which is narrower has a shorter profile and longer clasps; and 8.6% received a combination. In the MitraClip arm 39.3% were treated with an NT/NTR/XTR device while 60.7% received the newer-generation G4 device which has independent clasps for gripping the mitral leaflets.

With respect to major adverse events—a composite safety endpoint that included cardiovascular death stroke MI need for renal replacement therapy severe bleeding and nonelective mitral valve reintervention—the Pascal system met the margin for noninferiority when compared with MitraClip (3.4% with Pascal vs 4.8% with MitraClip). At 30 days the 1.3% difference in major adverse events had a one-sided upper confidence boundary of 5.1% which fell within the prespecified 15% noninferiority margin.

With Pascal there was one cardiovascular death three severe bleeds and one mitral-valve reintervention. In the MitraClip group there was one cardiovascular death and two severe bleeds.

In terms of effectiveness the proportion of patients with MR ≤ 2+ at 6 months 96.5% with Pascal and 96.8% with MitraClip. The absolute difference of 0.3% had a one-sided lower confidence boundary of 6.2% which fell within the prespecified noninferiority margin of 18%. Regardless of device all patients achieved MR ≤ 2+ at discharge while 87.2% and 88.5% of the Pascal- and MitraClip-treated patients had MR ≤ 1+ at discharge. At 6 months 83.7% of the Pascal-treated patients and 71.2% of the MitraClip-treated patients had sustained MR ≤ 1+ suggesting there was “some loss of efficacy over the same course of follow-up” with MitraClip according to investigators. Mean valve gradients were stable over time in both groups.

There are going to be patients who are better candidates for one [device] or another. I don’t think we have that answer right now. Federico Asch

Commenting on this signal Lim told TCTMD: “Obviously this is only 6 months only 180 patients . . . We have to see if this bears out over the entire cohort over much longer follow-up. If it does then I think it is something operators will consider. It is mirrored in at least two other publications out of Europe that when they compared [Pascal] to MitraClip [they] seemed to find a decrease in efficacy with the MitraClip patients. It may bear out but right now it’s a little early to say.”

Sathananthan pointed out that CLASP IID does have limitations most notably the low patient numbers. However a second device one that appears to have less residual MR than that seen with MitraClip is a valuable addition. To TCTMD Sathananthan said one of the conundrums faced by operators who’ve performed edge-to-edge repair is that the severity of MR can be underestimated immediately after the procedure. Then at follow-up it’s not uncommon for MR to be a little bit higher than expected.

“So that sustained benefit [with Pascal] is promising” he said calling it a signal that is worth watching in the larger cohort and over long-term follow-up. “It’s nice to try to get surgical-like repair results at the end. All of this is positive for the field.”

Anita Asgar MD MSc (Montreal Heart Institute Canada) one of the panelists during the late-breaking science presentation called CLASP IID an important study for TEER as it highlights the safety of the procedure but also cautioned against making much of the direct comparison given the small number of patients especially since just 37 patients in the MitraClip arm received the new-generation G4 device.

Another panelist David Cohen MD (St. Francis Hospital Roslyn NY) pointed out there is observational data suggesting that achieving MR ≤ 1+ is better for patients with degenerative MR. If a difference between MitraClip and Pascal emerges with respect to these sustained MR reductions he said it could be a factor when choosing devices.

Quality of Life and Functional Outcomes

Patients in both treatment arms had significant improvements in functional capacity and quality of life when compared with baseline but there was no difference between devices. Procedure times were longer with the Pascal device (88 vs 79 minutes) but declined over time suggesting there is a small learning curve with the device. Most of the participating sites did not have prior experience with the Pascal device prior to CLASP IID the researchers point out.

Lim said that one advantage of MitraClip is the extent of operator experience noting that operators may lean towards it because they are comfortable implanting it. In terms of anatomy more complicated or thicker mitral leaflets requiring mechanical closure might also be suitable for MitraClip he said.

The full trial has completed enrollment and patients are currently being followed. They hope to present data from the full 300-patient cohort early next year said Lim.

The Pascal system has CE Mark approval in Europe for both MR and tricuspid regurgitation.

There are ongoing studies comparing TEER with MitraClip versus surgical mitral valve repair in patients with degenerative MR. One of those studies PRIMARY is a superiority trial funded by the National Institutes of Health with a planned enrollment of 450 patients at all levels of surgical risk. The other study is REPAIR MR a noninferiority study testing MitraClip versus valve repair surgery in degenerative MR patients at intermediate risk. Results from both trials aren’t expected for several years.

The CLASP IIF study is also ongoing. In that study investigators are comparing Pascal to MitraClip in patients with functional MR and prohibitive surgical risk.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI3NzI5MzAzMjIwMDQ0NzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First-in-Human Experience With the ModulHeart Device for Mechanical Circulatory Support and Renal Perfusion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.sciencedirect.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /science/article/pii/S2772930322004471 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952F39330>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI3NzI5MzAzMjIwMDQ0NzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NpemluZy1taXNtYXRjaC1wcm9ibGVtLWJhbGxvb24tZXhwYW5kYWJsZS12YWx2ZXMtc21hbGwtYW5udWxpLXRhdmnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sizing Mismatch a Problem for Balloon-Expandable Valves in Small Annuli TAVI,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NpemluZy1taXNtYXRjaC1wcm9ibGVtLWJhbGxvb24tZXhwYW5kYWJsZS12YWx2ZXMtc21hbGwtYW5udWxpLXRhdmnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952F3A8C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

After last season’s First Four loss to Dayton in the NCAA Tournament Bruno will apply his newly acquired players with his returning players and look to make noise in the Big East.

The Blue Demons will open the season with their portion of non-conference opponents at Wintrust Arena against American University on Wednesday Nov. 9.

This season DePaul will be participating in the Elevance Health Fort Myers Tip-off in Florida. The three day event runs Nov. 25 to Nov. 27 just after Thanksgiving. The Blue Demons will match up against the University of Maryland University of Pittsburgh and Towson University.

Following the Fort Myers trip DePaul will travel to Butler University where they will start the Big East portion of the schedule. Last season the Blue Demons had the Bulldogs number In the two meetings DePaul was victorious by a win margin of 34 and 37 points.

On Dec. 18 DePaul will host its Big East home opener against Georgetown another team the Blue Demons have had recent success against under Doug Bruno.

Wednesday Jan. 4 will be the first time the Golden Eagles of Marquette meet Bruno’s Blue Demons since the Big East tournament meeting last season. The Blue Demons against Marquette last season were 1-2 in those three meetings and left a bitter taste in their mouth following a 85 to 105 loss to end the Blue Demons season.

Geno Auriemma and the UConn Huskies will meet twice with the Blue Demons. The leaders of the Big East for the last 20 plus seasons look to continue its dominance.

DePaul nearly achieved their second win all-time against the Huskies when they fell short 78 to 80 in overtime. With star guard Paige Buekcers likely to miss the whole season with a torn ACL the Blue Demons could look to capitalize off the absence.

The regular season will conclude on Feb. 27 against Marquette on Fox Sports 1 and on March 3 the Big East Tournament will begin.

Bruno since taking over in 1988 has an overall 731-357 and has only had two seasons where his team did not achieve a .500 record or better.

DePaul will look to make it back into the NCAA Tournament and the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since the 2015-16 season.

CNN —

Home owners renters and potential buyers look at housing and the real estate market from different often conflicting perspectives.

There are alarming headlines for all three in recent weeks:

This convergence speaks to the larger problem of a shortage of affordable housing in the US as well as the broad issue of affordability and leads to stories like this: Majority of Americans say they’re worried about being able to pay for housing.

I went to Anna Bahney the CNN Business writer focused on real estate to understand why there’s a housing shortage and what if anything anyone is doing about it.

Our conversation conducted by email is below.

A housing shortage an affordability crisis

WHAT MATTERS: I have read both that there’s a housing shortage and that there’s a housing crisis. Is there a difference between those ideas – a shortage and a crisis? And is the problem that there literally aren’t enough houses for the number of people in the US?

BAHNEY: The “housing crisis” is actually an “affordability crisis.” Part of the reason housing has become so expensive for Americans is because there is a national shortage of homes. Record low interest rates during the pandemic coupled with more than a decade of under building created a supply and demand mismatch that has pushed home prices higher.

The US has fallen behind by about 5.5 million housing units over the past 20 years as builders failed to keep up with historical building trends. If you add in property destruction due to demolition or natural disasters among other things the total shortfall could be 6.8 million during that time according to the National Association of Realtors.

This is a gap so deep that it would take more than a decade to catch up. But even if more homes and apartments are built it won’t matter unless people can afford them.

Mortgage rates are the highest they have been since 2008 and home prices remain near record highs pricing many prospective homebuyers out of the market. Those people then remain in the already tight rental market pushing rents up even further.

As tenants reach the limits of what they can afford to pay each month homeownership gets further out of reach as they struggle to save for a down payment. This widens the wealth gap and locks in place inequities between those who benefit financially from homeownership and those who don’t. It also widens the racial home ownership gap in which 72% of White Americans are homeowners while only 43% of Black Americans own a home.

The cost of housing is driving inflation

WHAT MATTERS: The cost of housing has been cited as a cause of inflation. To what extent is that true and what is the market force that could lower the cost of housing?

BAHNEY: The soaring cost of housing has been a key driver of inflation. For most people housing is their biggest expense. About one-third of the Consumer Price Index a basket of goods and services the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to track inflation is the “shelter” component.

Last month the index showed that inflation was worse than expected and the housing component had risen 6.2% from a year ago the biggest increase since 1991. Stubbornly high inflation means that the Federal Reserve will likely take aggressive action at its meeting next week with either a 75 basis-point hike in interest rates or potentially a 100 basis-point hike.

But there are some early signs of cooling in the housing market. Home sales have been dropping for six months in a row as the rising cost to buy and finance a home pushes more people out of the housing market. As demand dries up prices will come down and eventually mortgage rates will settle.

Where is the housing shortage felt the worst?

WHAT MATTERS: Which parts of the country are most affected by this problem?

BAHNEY: Cities in the Sun Belt like Phoenix and Austin saw some of the biggest increases in housing costs during the pandemic. In Miami the price of a home is up 33% from a year ago and rents are up 26% from last year. But the affordability crisis is happening nationally in all regions of the country.

The median-priced house now costs $749 more per month

WHAT MATTERS: The Fed’s medicine for inflation is to raise interest rates which has driven up mortgage rates. That might control sales prices but won’t it make the cost of housing more expensive?

BAHNEY: The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates in order to stem inflation which may reduce demand but also makes the cost of buying a home even more expensive.

But the Fed doesn’t set the rate borrowers pay on mortgages directly. Instead mortgage rates tend to track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury. As investors anticipate the Fed’s rate hikes they often sell government bonds which sends yields higher and with it mortgage rates.

The rate on a typical 30-year-fixed mortgage has more than doubled from a year ago making a home purchase that was possible then out of reach for some today.

A year ago a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $359900 home and financed the rest with a mortgage rate of 2.86% – which was the average at the time – had a monthly payment of $1192.

Today a homeowner buying the median priced home which is now $403800 with a mortgage at the current average of 6.02% would pay $1941 a month in principal and interest. That’s $749 more every month.

Americans are now spending more than 35% of their median income on monthly principal and interest payments on that median-priced home. Historically Americans spent closer to 25% of their median income on payments.

To get back to that level some combination of these things would need to happen according to mortgage data company Black Knight: a person’s income would need to grow by 40% mortgage rates would have to be cut in half or there would need to be a 30% drop in the median price of a house.

None of those are likely to happen any time soon.

Homeownership is getting out of reach

WHAT MATTERS: If housing prices go down it will mean millions of people lose value in their main asset. If housing prices don’t go down it means millions of Americans will never own a home. It seems like an impossible situation.

BAHNEY: Some housing economists have been saying lately that the housing industry is in a recession but homeowners aren’t feeling that way. Sure there are plenty of examples of cooling in the housing industry (mortgage firm layoffs home builders pulling back home sales falling). But homeowners still have tremendous equity in their homes which has risen by an average of $60000 in the past year.

Still millions of people are being shut out of homebuying as the affordability challenges prove insurmountable.

In April 2021 a household had to earn about $80000 a year to afford payments on the median-priced home with a modest down payment of 3.5%. A year later the income requirement was $108000. This cost increase means that about 4 million renter households that could have bought the median-priced home last year could no longer do so 12 months later.

How can this problem be fixed?

WHAT MATTERS: What are some of the ideas to fix this problem? Is there an effective way the government can act?

BAHNEY: Most housing policy experts say that building a steady supply of new moderately priced homes is job number one. But because those homes are not as profitable for builders as larger higher-priced homes it will take a concerted effort by both public and private sectors.

In May the Biden administration announced a Housing Supply Action Plan to close the affordability gap and ease housing costs. The plan aims to boost the supply of affordable housing by enhancing existing federal financing and incentivizing areas to reform zoning and land use policies to build more lower-cost housing. It also calls for homebuilders to adopt more efficient construction methods.

But none of this is a quick fix and some of it requires congressional action.

Separately the Federal Housing Finance Administration which oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has announced plans this summer to expand home financing options for buyers particularly those of color to close the racial homeownership gap. These programs include down payment assistance lower mortgage insurance premiums and a credit reporting system that factors in rent payment history.

Some of these ideas including new zero down payment loans with no closing costs for buyers in specific Black or Hispanic neighborhoods are already in place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL2JsYWNrLXNlYXR0bGUtaG9tZW93bmVyc2hpcC1yZW1haW5zLWxvdy1hLXByb2dyYW0tdG8tZml4LWl0LXN0cnVnZ2xlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Seattle homeownership remains low.

For many of our editors this fall it’s a swarm of spooky black bats.



The totally Instagrammable bat decor trend has been a Halloween staple in my house thanks to a pack of Martha Stewart brand bats I bought a few years back. With the rise in popularity Etsy and Amazon retailers are offering a ton of affordable options and I even multiplied our bat collection this year.

The minimalist style of the bats just works as a fun not-at-all-tacky complement to your other home decor. Try swarming them over the mantle going up the stairs as part of a styled console table or around the front door. Take a look at how our contributors editors and readers are styling Halloween bats in their own homes this fall.

Surrounding the Fireplace

The fireplace is the perfect spot for a bat display especially if you style your mantle for fall or Halloween.

Part of a Spooky Vignette

Whether you have bookshelves console tables or want to style them “flying” up the stairs bats in flight add a perfect spooky touch to any Halloween setup.

In the Kids’ Play Space

Bats are the perfect not-too-scary Halloween decor for kids’ spaces! They can complement a Halloween or fall-themed bookshelf display. They can also add a spooky touch to a playroom.

Lex Pott is a Dutch artist known for his unique take on candles. One of his most popular items is the Twist candle one piece of wax shaped to form both the base and the candle itself which burns at both ends according to its listing on Mociun where it sells for $45. The candle weighs in at 270 grams (just over 9 ounces) and has a burn time of approximately 10 hours per end (via Lex Pott). This is significantly less than your average 8 ounce candle that can burn for as long as 55 hours says Malibu Apothecary.

The Twist candle is unique; it's not something you'd typically find in most homes. This is in part due to its hefty price tag which often deters homeowners from purchasing a Lex Pott creation. Luxury candles aren't a new concept but the average person may have trouble justifying buying a pricier candle when there are often very similar styles at a more affordable price.

Cash Only’s 420 Recs is an ongoing series where interesting folks offer recommendations for all things 420 — what strains they like what weed products are blowing their minds and what they like to do once stoned.

Mira Gonzalez rolls the best most aerodynamic blunts west of the Mississippi. On the east the award goes to Janice Griffith—Cash Only fam and unsurprisingly one of Mira’s BFFs. Her skills are so good that she could easily land one of those gigs being the personal roller for a rapper—maybe Waka Flocka Flame is still hiring?

Yes Mira is a legendary toker and she’ll tell you she has the tolerance of at least five grown men though the number could be higher. Outside of huffing Dutchies Mira is an accomplished writer poet and illustrator—with an always-funny Twitter to boot. She’s also published a poetry collection an NSFW coloring book and temporarily co-hosted a really good podcast called “Really Good Financial Advice.”

Mira and I go back to our days as editors at Merry Jane Snoop Dogg’s cannabis media brand. One of the best parts of that gig entailed me catching a ride to work with Gonzalez and us chain smoking blunts while brainstorming articles or talking shit for the whole damn cruise. We also did some great work like breaking a story on black market vape carts and how they were causing a mysterious lung illness amongst consumers as well as partnering with Pornhub on a series of videos including one in which Mira and Janice turned a fleshlight into a bong.

Mira always makes me laugh and her 420 Recommendations for Cash Only definitely scratched that itch. Below the weed lord explains how strain names are mostly fake her love of getting high and “freaking the fuck out” to weird movies and shopping for very expensive hyper-realistic babies on Etsy. Thanks Mira we love ya!

What’s your current favorite strain and how do you like to consume it?

Mira Gonzalez: Honestly one of the first things I learned when I started working in the weed space is that strains are mostly fake and so is the divide between indica and sativa lol.

For example my first job involving weed was as a budtender for a weed dispensary in Los Angeles when I was 19. When we got new weed me the one other employee and the owner would smoke a blunt together. Then the three of us would collectively decide if the weed would be labeled as indica or sativa and what that strain would be called. (Anything we gave the name “Girl Scout Cookies” or “Blue Dream” would sell extremely fast.)

All of that is just to say I don’t really have a favorite strain. I find it’s more reliable to choose my weed based on scent THC content and vibes.

My favorite way to get stoned kinda changes depending on my mood. I go through phases but lately I’ve been dabbing a lot.

When it comes to flower though my favorite way to smoke will always be blunts. Dutches are my preferred brand but tbh I’m not picky. I’ll never be too proud to smoke a Swisher if that’s what’s available.

Do you have any favorite weed products right now?

Like I said I’ve been dabbing a lot. Raw Garden is probably my favorite brand for concentrates.

I also love edibles but I have the weed tolerance of like five grown men so I always want the really strong shit. In California that mainly comes in the form of pills and tinctures. Some of my favorite brands are Protab (tablets) and Proof (tinctures). For flower I love Pure Beauty.

What activity do you like to do after you’ve gotten really stoned?

I love getting really high and braiding my hair. I also like finding weird or niche Etsy shops. The other day I found a shop that just sells hyper-realistic fake babies for thousands of dollars each. The shop had a ton of five star reviews from really happy customers.

Can you recommend something to watch while really high?

Well personally I love to get high and freak the fuck out; just absolutely lose my shit. So if that sounds appealing to you here are some of my recommendations:

Eraserhead (1977)

Angst (1983)

House (1977)

Natural Born Killers (1994)

SexWorld (1978)

Can you recommend something to listen to while smoking?

Taylor Swift.

Can you recommend something to read once stoned?

Wikipedia.

Who’s in your dream blunt rotation?

Cornel West and Dolly Parton.

The housewife and her family will be visiting Malaysia for three days in November. Earlier this year the expected waiting time for new passports was six weeks.

In May ICA received more than 7000 passport applications per day and long queues formed outside the ICA Building in Kallang Road.

Ms Zalina was surprised she could collect the passports so quickly.

Singaporeans who apply for a new passport can now expect a shorter processing time of one to two weeks ICA told The Sunday Times on Sept 13.

But those with year-end travel plans should apply for a passport now said ICA.

It added: ""Based on pre-Covid-19 trends passport applications typically peak between October and December.

""Singaporeans who submit their passport (application) late will risk not being able to collect their passport in time for their travel.""

ICA reminded Singaporeans that the processing time depends greatly on the volume of applications it receives. Applicants should also factor in additional waiting time for an appointment to collect the passport when it is ready.

To tackle the surge in May nearly 300 officers from other work units across ICA were deployed to process and produce passports.

ICA noted how it has worked with SingPost to increase the passport issuance capacity and that the combined efforts have greatly improved the situation.

Travel experts urged those who require a passport to apply now ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays.

In a survey commissioned by The Straits Times and conducted by market research firm Milieu Insight in September 32 per cent of the 1000 respondents said they will be travelling overseas in the last four months of the year and have already booked tickets or accommodation.

Ms Lavinia Rajaram Asia head of public relations for Expedia Group said that based on Expedia flight search data Bangkok Seoul and Kuala Lumpur remain the top travel destinations for Singaporeans.

Reminding Singaporeans who intend to travel to plan ahead Dr Michael Chiam a senior tourism lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic said: ""There might be a delay in the renewal of passports if there is another surge towards the end of the year.""",,,,,,

It took her over two years to build the tiny yet spacious home as she had no previous experience but she learned along the way. She did have some help especially from her dad who has carpeting experience.

The project is based on a 10ft (3m) wide and 24ft (7m) long trailer. The reason for the big size is that this is now her home as she didn't find the idea of a stationary house all that appealing. The trailer offers her the freedom of moving wherever she wants but also a feeling of uniqueness given it was made by her. She built the mobile home on a single floor as she dislikes the idea of having to climb up through a narrow space to the loft every night just to go to sleep.Carina is a nature lover and has many plants in front of the house all of which sit in repurposed objects in the most eco-friendly fashion. Stepping inside we get into the living room where we find a closet that seems to only be enough for one person.For a nice view perhaps while reading or just daydreaming she also built a small couch next to a window. She wanted a small built-in sofa so she can have an open space to do her yoga routine and just have some time for herself.The living space also includes two tables one for herself and one for her partner. The table Carina built for herself is low to the ground and is made of only two bricks and a tabletop as she confesses she prefers sitting on the floor instead of a chair.As the flowerpots in front of the tiny home would hint Carina really likes plants and she works as a floral designer for a flower farm. Next to a little stove she put a lot of flowers that got rejected by the farm and she thought of giving them a new life.The kitchen and bathroom are built back-to-back separated by a sliding door. The bathroom seems rather spacious for a mobile home but she deserves credit for this. Carina made great use of the space designing a custom shelf next to the shower cabin and not wasting any chance at gaining some extra storage.The choice of a comically tiny toy-looking sink combined with a small washing machine means she managed to make the most out of the limited space available. However she made sure she gave the sink a makeover building a custom cabinet for it and using some tiles her mother brought from Mexico to decorate it. The environmentally conscious theme continues as Carina decided to buy a composting toilet that does not use up any water. She admits it is a bit challenging to use but it’s worth it to her.To build the kitchen she used wood that she found around the land where the tiny house now lies. She cut it sanded it and oiled it to finish the masterpiece that those cabinets are. On the countertops she added a small two-burner stove. Two little sliding doors hide the microwave trash can and other kitchen utensils inside the kitchen cabinets and provide easy access. We can also see a small fridge covered by a movable countertop allowing for its replacement with a bigger unit shall the need arise. For extra space there’s a long wooden plank beneath the window serving multiple purposes. It could be used as a bar area dinner table or even additional storage space especially while cooking.Next up is the bedroom with the bed itself being the focal point. And it is quite a clever contraption. The frame manages to not only be home to a few big drawers for extra storage but also hide the plumbing. This makes it accessible for repairs by just removing the mattress and lifting the plank beneath. The wall decorations are all meaningful for her. They are either concert tickets pictures of places she visited or various gifts.Carina says the project was something she thoroughly enjoyed and now plans to use the experience she gained to start building customized tiny homes for other people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vcmVub3ZhdGlvbi9ibG9vbWluZ3Rvbi1pbmRpYW5hLWlrZWEta2l0Y2hlbi1jYWJpbmV0LXJlbm92YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Julia Child-Worthy Pegboard and Glossy IKEA Cabinets Mingle in This Indiana Kitchen,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

Before Domino’s deputy commerce editor Samantha Weiss-Hills and her husband Alex closed on their Bloomington Indiana home in 2017 they already had an email chain going with their architect. In exchange for $5000 Andrew Heathfield helped the couple mock up plans for their long-awaited renovation (they had been living in the untouched rental for more than a year at that point) which included a near-complete overhaul of the kitchen. Then Sam called up her contractor father to take the lead on the transformation. He built a range hood out of 2-by-4s installed their Bosch dishwasher and even bloodied a finger while hanging the sliding door leading to the new dining area but never without a smile on his face. “My dad has been doing this forever so it was fun to watch him” she says.

The kitchen before.

Storage was paramount for the couple: they love to entertain plus Sam was working for Food52 at the time so she was constantly testing new recipes and gadgets. Not having to stress over labor costs freed up the budget for most of their must-have items. Ahead she takes us behind the scenes of her clever kitchen renovation.

A Clean Slate

At first Sam questioned whether shiny white cupboards from IKEA were the correct fit aesthetically for her circa-1900s bungalow but she was convinced it was the right move after she heard artist and designer Maya Schindler rave about how easy it is to wipe down hers. Plus the inner workings of the Swedish brand’s units are easily modified—the one closest to the breakfast bar serves as the pantry. “I’m a massive fan of drawers” Sam says. “Then you’re not digging through everything constantly.” The cabinets in the dining room hold so much more than extra cookware: They’re a place to store records rarely used china and dog food. “It’s a catchall” she notes. Refreshing the storage in both rooms came to a cool $10000.

Appliance (and Sink) Tetris

Dropping a proper island in the center of the kitchen offered an opportunity to play appliance Tetris. First off it provided a more sensible location for their new stainless steel dishwasher and $500 Ruvati sink (complete with cutting board garbage disposal drying rack and strainer). With those bits and bobs out of the way Sam and Alex could shift the refrigerator and the oven to the main wall resulting in the ever-sought-after work triangle.

It’s Groovy to Glide

The only demolition that took place involved widening the doorframe to what was previously the guest bedroom (now the dining room). “It was a really hard pinch point” recalls Sam. Heathfield tasked custom fabricator Central Scenic with creating a sliding door made from polycarbonate and powder-coated steel that when Sam and Alex desired could separate the area from the kitchen. When guests come to stay the room acts as the ultimate flex space. “We opted for soft close so it never slams” adds Sam.

Big Deal

The engineered hardwood flooring came in at—wait for it!—$200. It was luck really that their local shop was having a sidewalk sale: They were able to scoop up hundreds of square feet of flooring for practically nothing. A save like this left room in the budget for the splurge-worthy Heath backsplash tile (20 square feet cost $525). “We wanted to bring a little bit of warmth in given it’s a bungalow” shares Sam.

Test Kitchen

Sam and Alex did some experimenting before ultimately landing on Caesarstone’s Frozen Tundra ($4700) for their countertops. To see which material could handle the ingredients they like to cook with they ordered four samples and splattered them with turmeric coffee and tomato paste then washed the surfaces. Still in need of some bonus counter space the couple topped a $300 wire cubby unit with a slab of butcher block. “It’s so heavy now that it doesn’t even move” says Sam. “And it made it feel really cohesive [with the shelves].”

Tooth and Nail

The pegboard also fabricated by Central Scenic is chicer than your typical hardware store find: It’s stained an almost golden hue and features a streamlined miter edge. The catch the couple discovered too late? The bespoke design didn’t account for traditional peg-hook dimensions. “They were too thick; they wouldn’t go all the way on” Sam recalls. Her fix was to buy the screw-in kind but she still had to hammer each individual one’s back so they would adhere properly.

Power Move

It’s the little details like outlet placement that make a kitchen reno go round. Having plugs on each side of the stove proved to be a game changer for Sam and Alex want to quickly use a stand mixer or blender. She also strategically placed one on the island and another at the coffee bar—because whether you need to get through the workday or construction caffeine is crucial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBob2Jsb2dyYXBoZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvd2hlbi15b3UtbmVlZC1hLWxpdHRsZS1leHRyYS10ZW5iYS1heGlzLXYyLXRvcC1sb2FkZXItcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When You Need A Little Extra: Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader Review,"Spread the love

Last Updated on 09/19/2022 by Feroz Khan

Tenba makes some marvelous camera bags that look good and work great. I fell in love with their BYOB series when I tested a handful of them last year. They just revamped their Axis lineup of tactical bags with some innovative features additional sizes and new models. I spent some time with the new Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader holster-style bag. With a unique extendable feature that allows the bag to hold a camera with an attached 70-200 f2.8 lens it’s an excellent camera bag for daily walkabout photography.

The Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader looks and sounds a lot like the Top Loader Pro AW series of bags from Lowepro. But Lowepro has just two bags in this range to accommodate lenses of different sizes. This bag has a feature where the bottom of the Axis Top Loader can be unzipped for more space. This allows you to take a DSLR (ungripped) or a mirrorless camera (gripped or ungripped) with even a 70-200 f2.8 lens attached (hood reversed). I’ll enjoy this flexibility going forward; now I often have to take my backpack just to be able to carry my 70-200 on a photo walk. There were times when the only case that could safely hold my 70-200 lens was a backpack.

I may have just found my favorite walkabout camera bag for quick photowalks around the city. Tenba extended most of the new features of their Axis V2 range to the Top Loader bags which are available in two colors.

The Big Picture

Pros

Compact but expandable to accommodate a camera with up to a 70-200 f2.8 lens attached

Padded insert allows the inner space to be divided to keep slim accessories like a filter inside its case.

Can carry it with the padded shoulder strap or it can be hung on your waist belt.

Reflective MOLLE Webbing on the sides and front

You can add a Tenba Lens Capsule to almost double the space capacity of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader.

Neoprene sleeve inside allows you to conceal a tracking device such as an Apple AirTag.

Elastic side mesh pockets provide extra space for accessories like filters notebooks small speedlights and more.

Generously sized handle on the top allows you to easily grab and go.

Reversible silver and black rain cover included which collapses into an inbuilt cover in itself

CONS

No waist strap means the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader could swing a lot as you walk at a brisk pace.

Tracking device pocket could have been slightly larger. My Tile Sport Pro tracker didn’t fit easily.

MultiCam Black™ model is USD 10 more than the regular black option.

Upper inner portion of the bag could have had an elastic sleeve or at least tiny pockets for storing filters and/or memory cards.

This bag does the job of accommodating a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a large lens like a 70-200 well. The versatility of the expandable bottom means you don’t have to look for a separate bag to use for your daily photowalks to fit a longer lens. Tenba users will be pleased with the bag’s ability to easily add on items from their accessory range. The 3D airmesh side allows you to loop your waist belt through. I wish Tenba provided a waist strap as well. It’s a great bag to throw a single camera and lens into. But if you’re creative enough with your organization you can easily add a pancake-sized (or slightly larger) lens as well. And the dedicated tracker compartment provides peace of mind about the bag’s whereabouts.

I’m giving the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag four out of five stars for its adaptable size feature and durability. It misses a star for the lack of an included waist strap and the inability to store slightly larger trackers in the provided pocket. That pocket really should have been expandable.

Want one? Check them out on Amazon if you’re interested.

Gear Used

I tested the Black version of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag with my Nikon D810 and my AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f2.8G ED VR II. I also tried it with my Nikon Z6II which had a Smallrig L Plate and my Nikon Z 24-120mm. The tracker pocket was tested with an Apple Airtag Tile Sport Pro and Airbolt Smart Lock. We got to keep the Top Loader bag from Tenba.

Innovations

Tenba has included a “hidden” neoprene pocket inside the front compartment to store a Bluetooth or GPS tracker. While this is a nice addition to a camera bag this pocket could have been slightly bigger. Or it could have had a zipper on one side to add different-sized trackers.

It easily fits an Apple AirTag but it wasn’t so easy to get my Tile Tracker Pro in there. The product page for the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader says it can hold a “Tile Bluetooth Tracker.” This is possibly in reference to one of their smaller newer models. Tenba says this is the first camera bag to include a hidden pocket for such trackers.

Ergonomics

Top loading bags aren’t new so while Tenba has some competition in this field they’ve built a compact shoulder bag with most of the usual features in there. But they’ve also added some new features and improved upon some existing ones compared to other brands. The first of note is the top handle. This isn’t just a thin belt strap attached as an afterthought like some top-loading bags have. It’s a decently-sized ribbed grip handle that you can use to lift the bag off surfaces to sling across your shoulder. Your fingers will find it comfortable to hold on to when taking the bag’s weight off your shoulders or waist.

Two metal hooks are on either side of the bag. Thankfully these aren’t painted. They won’t look scratched up when the strap hooks move across them over time

The side of the bag meant to be closest to your body is padded with a 3D airmesh. This is usually the kind of material that backpacks have on the inner side against your back. There’s space behind this airmesh to loop your waist belt or hip belt on the Axis 20/24/32L Backpacks. It could have been used as a way to stop the bag from swinging too much as you walk. For this Tenba should have included a slim waist strap with a buckle. The gap is probably not big enough to slip over the trolley handle of your roller bag.

I’m always weary of elastic side pockets as it remains to be seen how long the elastic lasts. That said it’s not something really tight and it seems to stretch comfortably. It easily accommodates water bottles and speedlights.

Missed Potential

Here’s a missed potential. The inner side of the upper cover of the bag has nothing besides Tenba branding and the model of the bag. It could easily have used an elastic sleeve or a few pockets for memory cards and accessories. It’s thick and padded well to protect your camera gear but I think it’s an area wasted in terms of storage capability.

I’m very pleased the shoulder strap has the 3D air-mesh on the underside. This also ensures that the bag doesn’t slip off your shoulders as you walk. It’s an adjustable length strap of course.

Tenba has added MOLLE (Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) webbing on the sides and front of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag. This allows limitless expandability with Tenba accessories and military-standard pouches and accessories. The webbing is reflective so if you’re cycling or walking at night with this bag it helps you stay visible to traffic.

Use the front pocket (which has a sleeve to make a partition) to store filters notebooks smartphones or any number of accessories that can fit inside it.

The upper side of the front compartment is also where the neoprene pocket for the tracker is located. Again I think this should have been bigger. Hopefully V3 will correct this.

The inside is spacious and Tenba has included a padded partition too. But this is only attachable to the two velcro strips placed off center. Larger strips could have made for a more customizable interior. Not a complaint but it does limit the internal partition size to just one option. I guess you could just take it off the velcro and stick it between the camera/lens and whatever else you want.

Build Quality

Tenba doesn’t list any waterproof or weather-resistant capabilities for this bag. The upper part of the bag (without any protective cover) was able to keep water out of the bag.

The rain cover doesn’t completely cover the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag. The 3D airmesh at the back is completely uncovered by this. Keep this portion close to your chest in the rain even with the rain cover over the bag.

You can tuck away the rain cover into a small pocket built into itself. You can then toss it into the bag or just store it elsewhere. The bag has no dedicated pocket for the rain cover like some other top-loading bags do.

The generously long strap has a shoulder pad. The upper side is made of the same material used for the top of the bag. Its air mesh padding keeps your shoulders comfy though I occasionally found myself switching shoulders.

The lack of a waist strap aside this is a comfortable bag to walk around with. It occasionally swings a bit but it’s nothing that can’t be fixed if you get a waist strap from elsewhere. I’d buy one of these straps if Tenba sold them.

I didn’t have any compatible accessories that could be used with the MOLLE webbing. But I’m confident it’ll perform as advertised.

Ease of Use

Expanding the depth of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag is as simple as unzipping the base of the bag and pulling it out. There’s a small tab you can grip on to while pulling out the base.

As long as the lens hood is retracted it should be reasonably easy to fit your camera and lens inside.

with the base extended out with a Nikon D810 and 70-200 f2.8 VRII

There’s a lot of space inside. If the inside was lined with more padding options I’d probably be able to partition it to store additional stuff inside even without expanding the base. You could fit in a power bank memory cards pen notebook filter water bottle phone Swiss Army knife and a face mask without much effort.

Collapsing the expanded portion is just as easy. You can either just push it back inside or pull on it from the inside and zip it up

Who Should Buy The Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader Bag?

Anyone who wants a daily carry camera bag for quick photo walks will find the spatial expansion capabilities of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader useful. Keeping in line with the other bags in the Tenba Axis V2 series it’s rugged and durable: understandable as Tenba has a history of making bags for the military. Do you like using a 70-200 f2.8 for street photography (like I do)? Then this is the perfect bag for you. Are you a photographer who only carries one lens while out on assignment? Take the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader on one of your photo jobs to see how it performs. I think with a bit of engineering you could fit more than one lens inside if your primary lens isn’t too long. In fact just about every kind of photographer could find some use for this bag on short photo assignments.

Last Updated on Sunday 18 September 2022 23:37 by Denis Chabrol

The Guyana government on Sunday sought to debunk claims that an amendment to the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) with the ExxonMobil-controlled consortium sets the stage for wide-ranging changes so that Guyana can draw down more money from the deal on the prolific Stabroek Block.

The Irfaan Ali-led administration aimed to allay likely fears that it could take on board Chartered Accountant Christopher Ram’s assertion that the PSA could undergo major changes through renegotiation. “The government reiterates that the contract will remain fiscally unchanged for the country and investors’ benefits” the Ministry of Natural Resources said in a statement.

Neither the then David Granger-led coalition government nor the People’s Progressive Party Civic (PPPC) administration had mentioned that the PSA had been amended under Mr Granger’s signature that the ExxonMobil majority-owned Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) could reclaim the 2 percent royalty. The privately-owned independent Stabroek News newspaper on Sunday reported that A Partnership for National Unity+Alliance For Change (APNU+AFC) coalition administration had amended the 2016 PSA on April 26 2019 to prohibit the recovery of royalty.

According to the Guyana government on Sunday that modification has been implemented and enforced through the mechanisms on the payments for royalties and cost recovery conditions and the monitoring features which set out for the governance of the cost bank regarding the projects subject to petroleum operations.

The Ministry of Natural Resources admitted that it was “fully aware” of the 2016 amendment but seemed at pains to insist that there would be no renegotiation of “specific fiscal considerations” in existing PSA as that “could impose unfavourable effects on current and future investments in Guyana given the current world petroleum economy.”

“The Government of Guyana respects the investments made by the petroleum consortium in the Stabroek Block and will continue to work assiduously through various agencies on every additional license and environmental permit as has been done for Payara and Yellowtail developments” the Ministry added.

That Ministry also seized the opportunity to rule out the existing PSA on the Stabroek Block being applied to other blocks for production or exploration. “This includes the upcoming competitive bidding round that the government intends to host in the last quarter of this year and other commercially viable discoveries that will be made in other oil blocks. The 2016 model or any previous PSA will not be applied to any other oil block where a discovery has been made” according to the Natural Resources Ministry.

ExxonMobil is the major operator in the Stabroek Block alongside Hess and the China National Overseas Oil Company (CNOOC).

The company based in Memphis Tennessee warned it will likely miss Wall Street’s profit target for its fiscal first quarter that ended Aug. 31. And it said it expects business conditions to further weaken in the current quarter amid weaker global volume.

Its stock fell more than 16% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

“Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter both internationally and in the U.S.” FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a statement. “We are swiftly addressing these headwinds but given the speed at which conditions shifted first-quarter results are below our expectations.”

The company’s FedEx Express business was particularly hurt by challenges in Europe and weaker economic trends in Asia which led to a roughly $500 million revenue shortfall for the segment. FedEx Ground revenue meanwhile came in about $300 million below the company’s forecasts.

High operating expenses were also a drag on the company’s results FedEx said.

In response it said it will cut costs by closing over 90 FedEx Office locations and five corporate offices deferring new hires and operating fewer flights.

The company scrapped its forecast for its earnings in its current fiscal year that it had issued less than three months ago.

For the three months ended Aug. 31 FedEx now projects adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 and $23.2 billion in revenue. That’s below analysts’ consensus forecast of $5.14 adjusted earnings per share and $23.6 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

Subramaniam noted that he remains confident FedEx will achieve its fiscal year 2025 financial targets.

For the current quarter which ends in November FedEx expects revenue to range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion and adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.75. Wall Street analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of $5.48 and $24.86 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

The company still plans to buy back $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal 2023. It expects to buy back $1 billion of its common stock during the second quarter.",,,,,,,,,

Photo / Sharni Dysart

A Waihi wedding photographer is accused of breaking the hearts of newlyweds by failing for many months to hand over some or all of several couples' wedding pictures.

When Grace thinks back to her wedding in April this year it isn't her vows dress or seeing her husband at the altar that initially comes to mind.

She thinks of the photographer she hired Sharni Dysart.

Earlier this month Grace told the Herald on Sunday she and her husband were yet to receive any images from Dysart who also goes by the last name Measures online.

""It's affected me in quite a big way. I know it's just wedding photos but I've had sleepless nights I've been so stressed about it. Whenever people ask me when are we gonna see your wedding photos I usually break down in tears.""

Even on her wedding day Grace said things did not run smoothly. She said Dysart failed to turn up claiming she was a close contact of someone with Covid and hired a freelancer to cover their wedding instead.

Although she wasn't shooting the wedding Grace said Dysart was still in charge of editing the images and sending them to the couple.

Grace who lives in Auckland and only wants to share her middle name told the Herald on Sunday the freelance photographer who shot the wedding informed her it shouldn't take more than three or four weeks for Dysart to finish the photos.

But as the months ticked by the pictures didn't eventuate.

""It feels awful to be honest. I just really want my wedding photos. You only get married one time and I'm just really scared I'm never going to get them back.

""It's our special day and she's kind of taken that from us and it's not really about the money for me. I just want the memories.""

Grace is now one of the dozens of members or former members of a Facebook group of spurned newlyweds left in the lurch by Dysart.

Nearly two weeks after the Herald first approached Dysart for comment Grace received her images.

Although she is relieved and happy Grace still feels like their special day was taken away from them.

""I really don't think it's kind of acceptable. It was really unfair on myself and others because well for myself I went through six months of stress thinking I might not get them. Pretty much every unanswered message made me so so anxious and I think I don't know if I hadn't gone to the media if I would have got them.""

Dysart said issues raised by the Herald were being addressed through the ""proper channels"" if they had not been already.

She said her legal and health advice was not to engage in sources of stress so she would not comment further.

Georgia Smith and her partner Isaac Smith married in September last year and while she has the images now she said they're still waiting for prints from Dysart.

In their contract Smith said it stated they would start getting access to some photos to look over within a few days of the wedding and would get to see the photos no later than 12 weeks after the wedding.

But as the weeks passed she said the pictures did not arrive.

""It got to about week eight and she had posted some of my wedding photos to her Instagram.

""When people were asking for my wedding photos the only thing I had to show were these screenshots of her Instagram.""

At that point Smith who works in healthcare in South Waikato said Dysart had still not sent her any images and was ignoring her messages.

""I was emailing her I was sending her text messages Instagram Facebook like everything and she wasn't replying.""

It wasn't until the end of February or mid-March that Smith said she got any images from Dysart. Nearly a year on from her special day she said she's still waiting for the prints.

""I didn't realise how many people she had done this to. And yeah I just want my photos I want nothing more than for everyone else to get their photos or some form of justice. Because it's not fair.""

Xavia Connolly was in a similar boat.

At the Otorohanga teacher's wedding day on December 20 Connolly said Dysart arrived late and was ""very casual"".

When the event wrapped up she alleges Dysart told her she would send through about 10 photos as a ""sneak peek"" in the next few days.

But like the others she said her images also did not arrive on time and by January 10 she emailed Dysart to inquire about where her ""sneak peek"" photos were.

Near the end of January she got a copy of the 10 preview shots and in March she received some more back. But she was still waiting for the remaining images when the Herald on Sunday first spoke to her.

""We don't even have a photo of our actual wedding ceremony. Like we don't we don't even have a photo of me walking down the aisle or us standing. We don't have those"" she said earlier this month.

""It's not just the photos it's not just the money it's the moments of our life aren't captured any more.""

Like Grace Xavia received the images from Dysart this week.

""The fact that we have our photos back is surreal in two ways: one that we have actually got them back; and two that she seemingly only got them back to us because she caught wind that her misdealings were finally catching up with her.""

A spokesperson for Consumer NZ said a photographers' clients are covered under the Consumer Guarantees Act (CGA) which requires the provider to undertake their service with reasonable care and skill and within a reasonable time.

They argued that taking up to a year to hand over images or not handing over the photos as expected breached the consumer's rights under the CGA.

Dianne Lewis a law student from Tauranga decided to take Dysart to the Disputes Tribunal earlier this year after waiting many months to get the photos from her wedding.

She said an adjudicator ruled in Lewis' favour that Dysart had breached their contract and she was ordered to pay $1400.

This Lewis said was the cost they had to pay to the other photographer who had covered her December wedding day after Dysart claimed she hadn't had her second Covid-19 jab in order to get the images from her.

It wasn't until after the Herald on Sunday contacted Dysart this month that Lewis said the photographer finally transferred the funds.

Jenna* who doesn't want to use her real name was also taking Dysart to the Disputes Tribunal over her experience.

Two days before Jenna was due to wed in late January Dysart informed her she was a Covid close contact so she would be unable to photograph the wedding but she had again hired a fill-in who would take the images and Dysart would edit them.

Again as time passed the pictures had still not been sent and by the third month of waiting Jenna realised something was up.

Screenshots of messages from Jenna to Dysart show her messaging the photographer on several occasions across several days and Dysart not replying.

""I was feeling very anxious very nervous and possibly a little bit depressed about it as well.""

Jenna said she reached out to the photographer who was there on her wedding day asking why she couldn't give her the images from her wedding day.

""She said it's because it goes against her agreement with Sharni.""

She said the photographer advised her to try to go through the tribunal route to get the images. While her hearing was scheduled for later this month after Herald inquiries she said Dysart provided the images back on Friday.

This week she too received her images back Dysart.

""It's our wedding day. And you don't want to not have your photos back of your big day. It only happens once.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

With Chase Elliott pursuing him relentlessly for the final 50 laps Chris Buescher held on to win Saturday’s Bass Pro Shops Night Race at Bristol Motors Speedway becoming the 19th different NASCAR Cup Series winner this season.

After the event that set the field for the Round of 12 in the series Playoffs—and eliminated superstars Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick from the postseason—a dozen drivers were breathing sighs of relief and hoping fervently for a return to stock car sanity in the next round.

A two-tire pit stop under caution on Lap 438 of 500 put Reddick in the lead for a restart on Lap 444. The driver of the No. 17 Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing Ford led the final 61 laps and a race-high 169 overall to give the RFK organization its first victory since Ricky Stenhouse Jr. took the checkered flag at Daytona on July 1 2017 at Daytona.

The victory was the first for RFK Racing since Brad Keselowski joined the organization as an owner/driver after the 2021 season.

Buescher was the third straight non-Playoff driver to win a race in the Round of 16 an unprecedented occurrence.

“It’s so special here” said Buescher whose only other Cup win came in a rain-shortened race at Pocono in 2016. “I love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here. It’s so special. It’s pretty awesome.”

Buescher said he wasn’t worried about starting the final run on two fresh tires even though everyone chasing had four.

“I wasn’t a bit” he asserted. “It was up to me at that point. I made it work and we had a really fast (car). We knew we had a really fast race car in practice and didn’t quite get the job done in qualifying (20th)—but what a race car.

“I don’t know what all to say right now. I’m out of breath. This place will wear you flat-out and I love that about it. It’s just a special night.”

Elliott was .458 seconds behind Buescher at the finish. William Byron came home third followed by Christopher Bell who posted his third straight top-five finish in the Round of 16. Kyle Larson was fifth and Ross Chastain sixth as all five drivers immediately behind Buescher in the finishing order advanced to the Round of 12.

Denny Hamlin Chase Briscoe Daniel Suarez Joey Logano Ryan Blaney and Alex Bowman also clinched spots in the next round though all had serious issues during the race.

Elliott got closer to Buescher on the final two laps but ran out of time.

“I felt like we were gaining but it was… I wasn’t close enough to do anything with him” Elliott said. “But I appreciate the effort. We had a long day yesterday. Was able to battle back from a bad qualifying effort (23rd) to get a top two so proud of that.

“Glad to be moving on (in the Playoff) and looking forward to some more opportunities here these coming weeks.”

Needing a victory to advance to the next round Harvick ran consistently in the top five after staying out at the end of Stage 1 to gain track position. But Harvick’s chances evaporated in the pits on Lap 438 when his crew failed to secure the left-rear on his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford.

As the tire rolled away Harvick had to back up into his pit stall. The lost time left him 10th for the final restart on Lap 444. That’s where he finished exiting the Playoffs in 16th place.

“It was pretty tough” Harvick said. “We pitted in front of the 17 (Buescher) so just kind of the way the year has gone. Just went from having a chance to lead the parade to being a part of the parade. Just difficult to pass.”

Busch’s ouster was a touch-and-go affair. Both he and Tyler Reddick fell two points short after Austin Cindric who finished seven laps down in 20th place but gained enough positions by passing back markers to advance.

Busch had accumulated 14 points in the first two stages and was running above the cut line when his engine blew on Lap 270—Busch’s second such failure in the three Playoff races.

“It just goes with our year” Busch said. “I don’t even know what to say. I’m flabbergasted. I just feel so bad for my guys. They don’t deserve to be in this spot. They work too hard. We are too good of a group to be this low—down on the bottom fighting for our lives just to make it through. Two engine failures in three weeks that will do it to you.”

Reddick and Richard Childress Racing teammate Austin Dillon both failed to make the Round of 12 after both drivers’ Chevrolets were damaged in a 12-car pileup on the backstretch on Lap 277. Reddick finished 25th and Dillon 31st.

Keselowski led 109 laps and appeared to have race-winning chances until his right-front tire went flat on Lap 414 while he was leading.

“We had two cars that were really good today and one that was unlucky and one that executed and everything came the right way for them” Keselowski said.

It took a two-tire pit stop with about 60 laps left to go at Bristol Motor Speedway to get clean air for the No. 17 RFK Racing driver.

Buescher who led 169 laps became the 19th driver to win in 2022 tying the Modern Era record.

“This is just so special this team does such a great job” Buescher told NBC Sports after the race. “Just so special here at Bristol. I love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here so special to me. Lost one that had really broke our heart back in 2015 on the Xfinity [Series] side with [Scott] Graves on top of the box so this makes up for that.”

When asked whether he was worried about the two-tire call on the last pit stop Buescher replied “Not one bit. It was up to me at that point. Just hold on and make it work. We had a really fast Fastenal Mustang. Just so proud of everybody. We knew we had a good racecar after practice and didn’t quite get the job done in qualifying. But what a racecar. It’s special. To get RFK in victory lane for the first time. We had great racecars Brad [Keselowski] had really good speed too.”

Tyler Reddick Kyle Busch Austin Dillon and Kevin Harvick ended up below the cut line after the race.

Chase Elliott placed second while his Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron was third. Christopher Bell was fourth after leading 143 circuits and Kyle Larson rounded out the top five.

Ross Chastain AJ Allmendinger Cole Custer Denny Hamlin and Harvick took positions six through 10 respectively.

Multiple cars including several playoff contenders encountered issues throughout the night.

It started with the Fords as several incurred flat right-front tires in stage one. First Harrison Burton and JJ Yeley had flats while Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney suffered down right-front tires later on.

Blaney’s issues continued throughout the early portion of the race which included a tire coming off on pit road and he eventually went behind the wall for repairs on the rear end of the car. He came back out on the track on lap 266.

All these problems brought the caution out several times allowing for differing pit strategies. The RFK Racing duo of Keselowski and Buescher were among those who had stayed out and the clean air helped them stay up front. Keselowski ended up winning stage one.

Buescher stayed out as did many others and held off advances from Harvick to maintain the lead through about lap 237.

During this period four Toyotas and one Chevrolet Alex Bowman reported power steering problems including both 23XI Racing drivers Bubba Wallace and Ty Gibbs. The pair’s pit crews worked on the cars behind the wall and sent them back out late in the race (lap 290 for Wallace; lap 317 for Gibbs).

A couple of Joe Gibbs Racing teammates also had troubles: Martin Truex Jr and Hamlin. Truex’s powersteering gave out as it blew the seals out. Hamlin had a right-front tire go down around lap 235 which also brought out the caution. He was able to continue.

A third JGR driver Bell inherited the lead when Buescher pit on lap 237 going on to win stage two.

Bell ended up leading the next 100 laps while the fourth JGR Toyota of Busch had an engine failure around lap 270. This once again brought out the yellow flag.

Then shortly after the next restart the Bristol big one occurred when Daniel Suarez got loose and tagged the No. 47 of Ricky Stenhouse Jr. As cars stacked up several got into each other including Richard Childress Racing’s Reddick and Dillon.

Reddick was able to get back on track but Dillon couldn’t due to a suspension problem.

Back at the front Bell was able to lead for much of the race though he lost the lead to Larson on pit road. Keselowski pulled a slide job on Larson on lap 388 to take first place.

Another playoff driver Joey Logano had a right-front flat with just over 100 laps remaining and had to pit.

Then a few laps later race leader Keselowski had his right-front tire go down forcing him to pit and allowing Bell to retake first.

On lap 425 pole-sitter Aric Almirola who had spun early on when Blaney got into the wall had a power steering problem and took his car behind the wall. About 11 laps later Bell’s right-rear tire went flat and the caution waved again.

Two more drivers in the playoff hunt had problems on pit road: Harvick and Hamlin. Harvick had a loose wheel but was able to back up without going very far and get a tire back on. However his hopes to win the race were dashed with this miscue.

The No. 11 had a bit of a different issue as some pins were damaged on the hub.

Buescher took two tires and found himself out front and in clean air. It was enough to hold on for the win becoming the third-straight non-playoff driver to win in the Round of 16.

Read more

As Bed Bath & Beyond goes through a seismic downsizing its Philadelphia-area footprint is shrinking too.

At the end of August the company announced that it would close about 150 “lower-producing” stores but a list of the first 56 stores slated for closure was only released this week.

The only Pennsylvania location so far is the Bed Bath & Beyond at the Wynnewood Shopping Center where the store currently occupies 61030 square feet of retail space. The rest of the company’s closures are concentrated in the Midwest New York and New Jersey although none yet in South Jersey. The closest store is in Manalapan Township in Monmouth County.

The company did not respond to requests for comment about how quickly their business will wind down or the number of employees affected. A Bed Bath & Beyond spokesperson would only say that the store would be shuttered “in the coming months” and that locations in King of Prussia and Jenkintown would remain.

Retail experts say that the Wynnewood Shopping Center’s landlord Federal Realty Investment Trust will have no difficulty finding another tenant in that location.

“This is a sizable vacancy on the Main Line which doesn’t happen that often” said Steven Gartner executive vice president of retail services with CBRE. “It’s often a good thing for shopping centers when a tenant that might not be relevant goes away. This is one of those do-overs that landlords get in tight real estate markets.”

Federal Realty Investment Trust did not return requests for comment.

Bed Bath & Beyond has experienced extreme turbulence in recent months as its stock plunged it announced mass store closures and a 20% reduction in staff. The company’s struggles turned even more tragic a couple of days after the announced downsizing when chief financial officer Gustavo Arnal leapt to his death from a Manhattan high rise.

Bed Bath & Beyond’s troubles arrive amid an uncertain time in the retail industry. In Center City the marquee Walnut and Chestnut Street corridors are still in flux after the pandemic drove a substantial amount of shopping online.

But some big box retailers like Target Macy’s and Kohl’s are performing strongly. In high-end suburban areas like Philadelphia’s Main Line retail sales have remained strong. That’s partly because the square footage available has not changed substantially as new development tends to be scarce in wealthy inner-ring suburban areas.

“Main Line retail remains extremely desirable and competitive for a few reasons” Gartner said. “Very high barriers to entry there’s virtually no development sites so properties like Wynnewood Shopping Center remain highly desirable.”

The Wynnewood retail hub dates to the 1950s during the postwar boom when the number of American suburban shopping centers exploded from eight in 1946 to 4000 in 1960. It marked the first of John Wanamaker’s department stores to open outside the central city. Today Bed Bath & Beyond occupies the space where Wanamakers once was.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHA6Ly9tLm1vdW50dmVybm9uZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL3NlcC8xNy9zY2VuZXMtbW91bnQtdmVybm9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scenes in Mount Vernon,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPConnectionPool(host='m.mountvernongazette.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/2022/sep/17/scenes-mount-vernon/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x00000239501C1A50>, 'Connection to m.mountvernongazette.com timed out.

The company based in Memphis Tennessee warned it will likely miss Wall Street’s profit target for its fiscal first quarter that ended Aug. 31. And it said it expects business conditions to further weaken in the current quarter amid weaker global volume.

Its stock fell more than 16% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

“Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter both internationally and in the U.S.” FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a statement. “We are swiftly addressing these headwinds but given the speed at which conditions shifted first-quarter results are below our expectations.”

The company’s FedEx Express business was particularly hurt by challenges in Europe and weaker economic trends in Asia which led to a roughly $500 million revenue shortfall for the segment. FedEx Ground revenue meanwhile came in about $300 million below the company’s forecasts.

High operating expenses were also a drag on the company’s results FedEx said.

In response it said it will cut costs by closing over 90 FedEx Office locations and five corporate offices deferring new hires and operating fewer flights.

The company scrapped its forecast for its earnings in its current fiscal year that it had issued less than three months ago.

For the three months ended Aug. 31 FedEx now projects adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 and $23.2 billion in revenue. That’s below analysts’ consensus forecast of $5.14 adjusted earnings per share and $23.6 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

Subramaniam noted that he remains confident FedEx will achieve its fiscal year 2025 financial targets.

For the current quarter which ends in November FedEx expects revenue to range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion and adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.75. Wall Street analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of $5.48 and $24.86 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

The company still plans to buy back $1.5 billion of its common stock in fiscal 2023. It expects to buy back $1 billion of its common stock during the second quarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1lYWdsZXMtZmFucy1zdWUtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1jb21tYW5kZXJzLXJhaWxpbmctY29sbGFwc2VkL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtZWFnbGVzLWZhbnMtc3VlLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tY29tbWFuZGVycy1yYWlsaW5nLWNvbGxhcHNlZC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four Philadelphia Eagles fans sue Washington Commanders after railing collapsed at FedEx Field last season,"Four Eagles fans sue Washington Commanders after railing collapsed at FedEx Field last season

Four Eagles fans sue Washington Commanders after railing collapsed at FedEx Field last season

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Viral video captured the frightening moments in the stands. Last season a railing collapsed at FedEx Field which sent Eagles fans falling onto concrete.

Now some of those fans are taking legal action.

Four Philadelphia Eagles fans are suing the Washington Commanders alleging they are still coping with injuries after a railing collapsed last January following a game at FedEx Field.

The four fans are each seeking more than $75000 for injuries they say they are still dealing with including medical costs and loss of income.

""It is remarkable how many mistakes were made"" Robert Sokolove an attorney from Curtin & Heefner LLP representing the Eagles fans said.

""The railings themselves were inadequate"" he added.

Video of the incident shows the four friends waiting for quarterback Jalen Hurts as he was walking off the field. Just as Hurts begins to high five the crowd the railing gives – sending several people tumbling to the ground and narrowly missing Hurts himself.

""It could have been catastrophic"" Sokolove said.

Sokolove said after the fall neither the team nor stadium staff assessed his clients' injuries.

""There was no care given no medical attention no contact"" Sokolove said. ""They didn't even get their names.""

Hurts can be seen helping fans and later wrote a letter to the NFL and Washington Commanders about follow-up action is being considered.

""The only person that seemed to be helping the people who landed on the ground is Jalen Hurts the guy who almost got clobbered"" Sokolove said.

Sokolove also said while one of the men injured takes a selfie with Hurts immediately after the fall that doesn't discount the seriousness of what happened.

""You're in a fog you're in a daze and I dare say when you end up literally at the feet of Jalen Hurts you're probably still in the fog"" Sokolove said.

Sokolove said while his clients deserve to be compensated these lifelong Eagles fans want something more

""They're really interested to make sure this doesn't happen again to anybody"" Sokolove said.

After the incident the team issued a statement saying the fans were offered an on-site medical evaluation and left of their own accord.
