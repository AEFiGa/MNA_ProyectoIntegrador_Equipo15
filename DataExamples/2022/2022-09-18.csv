Frerichs in exchange for the release by the United States of a prominent Afghan tribal leader who had been convicted of drug trafficking.

The release of the tribal leader Haji Bashir Noorzai who has close ties to the Taliban was hailed by supporters of the group as a major symbolic victory and a public sign of the Taliban’s enduring loyalty to its supporters.

During a news conference in Kabul the Taliban’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that Mr. Frerichs who had been held by the Taliban since 2020 had been handed over to the U.S. authorities at Kabul International Airport on Monday morning.

In return the United States released Mr. Noorzai a prominent financier of the Taliban in the 1990s who is known for his close ties to the group’s founder Mullah Mohammad Omar. Mr. Noorzai was convicted in the United States in 2008 of being part of an international narcotics trafficking conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2dGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy9zaW1wbHktbWFkLWFib3V0LWNyYW1lcnMtbmV3LW55c2Utc2V00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simply 'Mad' About Cramer's New NYSE Set,"New York—Moving CNBC’s “Mad Money” and Jim Cramer from Englewood Cliffs N.J. to the New York Stock Exchange in July may have seemed like the natural thing to do given the popularity and nearly 40-year presence of the show’s host in the trading community but making the move a reality required far more than installing new production and control room tech.

A product of close cooperation between the broadcaster and the New York Stock Exchange the project saw a major renovation of the 119-year-old building in an extremely high-profile area—a spot on the floor adjacent to where dignitaries ring the opening and closing bell to begin and end each trading day.

As a result all work had to be done in relatively short bursts well-defined windows of time after the close each trading day so everything appeared back to normal when specialists and floor brokers entered.

“The build took a long time because we had to work at night. Nothing could happen during the day” recalls Steve Fastook vice president of technical operations at CNBC. “No matter what we did at night it had to be clean put away covered and look like the floor during the day.”

The project was conceived of in December 2021 and work began in April 2022. After a lengthy build the new set made its debut July 18.

While building new sets and studios is nothing new to Fastook and the CNBC team the project at the stock exchange was unique. Unlike others the NYSE build required extensive renovation to portions of a national landmark.

“So everything had to be different” says Fastook. But despite the constraints and challenges moving the show to the New York Stock Exchange simply made sense because in Fastook’s words Cramer “is part of the fabric of that place. It’s Jim’s natural habitat.”

Scope and Renovation

To make it possible for the host to work from the exchange and best use his talents required two spaces: the main set on the floor of the exchange where Cramer tapes “Mad Money” and a smaller space dubbed Studio M (for “Mad Money)” away from the floor where the host can conduct private interviews with CEOs and other newsmakers who potentially might move the market if their interviews were overheard during a trading session.

John Casey Production Design was responsible for the look. “The set pays homage to its location” says Fastook. Designed with the color palette and textures of the exchange the set also showcases the history of the stock exchange and of Cramer.

For instance a reporter’s cap used circa 1915 on the exchange to differentiate between media and traders is displayed in one of the on-set trophy cases as are mechanical stock tickers. Items meaningful to the host and his history are displayed on the set as well including a football helmet of his NFL favorite the Philadelphia Eagles.

The project coincided with the beginning of the New York Stock Exchange’s own large-scale renovation of the trading floor. Part of the undertaking required transforming the exchange’s historic wooden trading posts. For Cramer’s morning show Post Nine was reworked into a modern glass structure with Planar flat display panels says Fastook.

The preliminary work also entailed major repair and restoration of an original marble wall that now serves as the background of the set. “This marble is about 120 years old and had holes drilled in it. It had chips taken out. It was discolored from being hidden by the wood that covered it for 100 years” he says.

A group of “amazing restoration” specialists hired by the NYSE brought new life to the old marble “returning it back to its original color filling the gaps and repairing the holes” he says.

Workers with other specialties bought in by the exchange played important roles as well. “We worked with the New York Stock Exchange’s contractors primarily ADCO Electrical on things like technical infrastructure power and fiber drops” he says.

Prepping the area for the new set also required a modification of the exchange floor. While portions of the sets and infrastructure were being readied offsite the exchange removed a trading post to make way for the main set.

“That left this really ugly looking floor that had been cut and built over. Everything had to be restored” he says adding that the necessary work on the floor created an opportunity to accommodate Cramer’s preferred way to work.

“Jim likes to work in a 360-degree fashion that’s why we shoot it with a Steadicam mostly” says Fastook. “He likes to move around. He has a chart on one side and the sound-effects board someplace else.”

Fastook however did not want an umbilical tether coming out of the desk that Cramer would have to think about whenever he moved. The solution required a master carpenter who works for the exchange to fashion a special piece of flooring that matched the existing floor and lifts out to accommodate the cabling when the space is transformed each trading day from part of the trading floor to the main set for shows. “When the desk (Cramer’s) is put away during trading hours it looks like a beautiful wood floor and when we open it up Jim’s desk is freestanding” he explains.

The ability to ready the space quickly for television was a major design consideration. “In about 20 minutes we can transform the trading floor into a full-out TV production set” says Fastook. “That happens every day.”

Set lighting illustrates the challenge of the fast turnaround while working within the constraints of a national landmark.

“Jim isn’t sitting in a chair so he doesn’t have key lights and two back lights” he says. “The whole area had to be lit so Jim could traverse around the set.

“At the same time the ceiling is 110 feet high. So we had to build an arrangement with a massive truss [and a smaller truss] that could drive down on motors and then drive back up on motors to be out of the way for New York Stock Exchange functions.”

Lowering the lighting truss over the set each day however raised the possibility lights might not be in the precise location needed for the show. To solve the problem quickly four laser lights attached to make finetuning positioning fast.

“The lighting director flicks the laser lights when he is ready for the trusses to come down. He watches them intersect and he knows he is perfectly aligned” says Fastook.

Another key consideration in the lighting design of the trusses was the environment in which they must function. “Lighting was really difficult there. The room was lit for people so it’s 3200 degrees K with all kinds of other color temperatures flashing in from monitors everywhere” he says.

The overarching lighting concern however was making sure the trusses did not look out of place during the trading day. “Things had to be the right color. So the trusswork is all gold and the wiring had to be hidden. Everything had to be really buttoned up which made it difficult” he says.

Besides the Steadicam the show produced in 1080i HD is shot with cameras mounted on two robotic pedestals on either side of the set. One of six robotic cameras mounted to Post Nine where Cramer does is morning show turns around and shoots the Lightning Round segment of “Money” says Fastook.

Studio M and More

Studio M where Cramer conducts private interviews during the trading day is a much smaller space off the floor of the exchange. Its centerpiece is a 109-inch 0.9mm Planar screen and an 80-inch Planar touchscreen that displays a telestrator for the host to explain stories. The background combines video and artwork of the front of the exchange. Doors and windows separate the studio from the floor to ensure privacy says Fastook.

To support the technical requirements of the new sets the broadcaster and the exchange converted two phone booths used “in the old days when traders needed to have a private conversation off the floor” into a space for racks and equipment he says.

“They were made out of this dark wood and they had frosted glass that we couldn’t bear to throw away” says Fastook.

Carefully removing and deconstructing the phone booths Fastook’s team preserved the original material and fashioned a wooden panel that when removed reveals the racks of infrastructure supporting the sets. The team repurposed the glass as well backlighting it with LEDs. “It’s beautiful. It is off to the side but you can see it on set” he adds.

Different goals guided how audio from both sets would be treated. For the main set the idea was to “celebrate the sound on the floor” although trading is finished by the time the show is produced so the din is lower than during the trading day. For Studio M the structure of the exchange “pretty well insulated” the space from those sounds during the day but to complete fully accomplish acoustic goals CNBC built “double-thick” walls says Fastook.

“It’s really not a matter of noise during production; it’s to prevent people from listening in” he says.

The project also required installation of a new 128 x 128 routing switcher to replace the existing 64 x 64 unit. However delivery of the router as well as other parts and pieces of the new infrastructure has been plagued by supply chain interruptions. For the moment CNBC is using the existing router and patches he says adding “even things like light fixtures we had to go to multiple vendors to source.”

CNBC shares control of the existing router –and will of the new router—with the exchange. “Basically everything on the floor is a router source and destination. We can feed the big wall; we can feed the vertical wall; and we can feed the wall in the back to telestrators” he says.

When not in use by CNBC the exchange takes control of the router feeding its digital signage system into the matrix to route to the displays used during shows for the broadcaster’s productions from the exchange he says.

Overall the project and the sets represent a highlight in Fastook’s career and a feather in the cap of CNBC. “We’re really proud of the classiness of the set and that you see that you’re on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange while also saying it’s Jim’s space.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL2FwLW9ubGluZS8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L3RhbGliYW4tZnJlZWQtZnJvbS1ndWFudGFuYW1vLWNsYWltcy1leGNoYW5nZWQtZm9yLWFtZXJpY2Fu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taliban freed from Guantanamo claims exchanged for American,"WASHINGTON (AP) — An American contractor held hostage in Afghanistan for more than two years by the Taliban has been released his family said Monday as a Taliban drug lord jailed by the United States was also freed and returned to Kabul.

Mark Frerichs a Navy veteran who had spent more than a decade in Afghanistan as a civilian contractor was abducted in January 2020 and was believed to have been held since then by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network.

Negotiations for his release had centered on a deal that would also involve the release of Bashir Noorzai a notorious drug lord and member of the Taliban who told reporters in Kabul on Monday that he had spent 17 years and six months in U.S. captivity before being released.

The exchange is one of the most significant prisoner swaps to take place under the Biden administration coming five months after a separate deal with Russia that resulted in the release of Marine veteran Trevor Reed. It took place despite concerns from his family and other advocates that the U.S. military departure from Afghanistan and the collapse of the government there could make it harder to bring him home and could deflect attention away from his imprisonment.

A U.S. official also confirmed the swap. Though the Biden administration did not immediately offer details about the exchange a sister of Frerichs who is from Lombard Illinois thanked U.S. government officials who helped secure her brother's release.

“I am so happy to hear that my brother is safe and on his way home to us. Our family has prayed for this each day of the more than 31 months he has been a hostage. We never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to us"" said a statement from the sister Charlene Cakora.

In Afghanistan Noorzai told reporters at a press conference that he had been released from an unspecified U.S. prison and handed over earlier in the day to the Taliban in Kabul in exchange for an American prisoner held in Afghanistan whom he did not identify. Frerichs' family subsequently confirmed that it was him.

Other Taliban officials claimed Noorzai was held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay but did not offer any support for that claim and a U.S. official said that this was not the case. Noorzai was prosecuted by the Justice Department which does not send its defendants to the military prison at Cuba and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009 on drug trafficking charges.

Frerichs 60 had been working on civil engineering projects at the time of his Jan. 31 2020 abduction in Kabul. He was last seen in a video posted last spring by The New Yorker i n which he appeared in traditional Afghan clothing and pleaded for his release. The publication said it obtained the clip from an unidentified individual in Afghanistan.

Until Monday U.S. officials across two presidential administrations had tried unsuccessfully to get him home. Even before their takeover of Afghanistan in August last year the Taliban had demanded the U.S. release Noorzai in exchange for Frerichs. But there had been no public sign of Washington proceeding with any sort of trade or exchange along those lines.

Eric Lebson a former U.S. government national security official who had been advising Frerichs' family said in a statement that “everything about this case has been an uphill fight.” He criticized the Trump administration for having given away ""our leverage to get Mark home quickly by signing a peace accord with the Taliban without ever having asked them to return Mark first.

“Mark’s family then had to navigate two Administrations where many people viewed Mark’s safe return as an impediment to their plans for Afghanistan” the statement said.

The collapse of the Western-backed Afghan government and takeover by the Taliban in August 2021 raised additional concern that any progress in negotiations could be undone or that Frerichs could be forgotten.

But his name surfaced last month when President Joe Biden who had publicly called for Frerichs' release was said by his advisers to have pressed officials to consider any risk posed to Frerichs by the drone strike in Afghanistan that killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.

The Taliban-appointed foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also spoke at the Kabul press conference alongside Noorzai and welcomed the exchange saying it marked the start of a “new era"" in U.S.-Taliban relations.

“This can be a new chapter between Afghanistan and the United States this can open a new door for talks between both countries” Muttaqi said at the presser.

“This act shows us that all problems can be solved through talks and I thank both sides' teams who worked so hard for this to happen” he added.

The Taliban also posted a brief video Monday on social media showing Noorzai’s arrival at the Kabul airport where he was welcomed by top Taliban officials including Muttaqi.

At the press conference Noorzai expressed thankfulness at seeing his “mujahedeen brothers"" — a reference to the Taliban — in Kabul.

“I pray for more success of the Taliban” he added. “I hope this exchange can lead to peace between Afghanistan and America because an American was released and I am also free now.”

Highland's Lockheed Martin and the other major defense manufacturers located there are constructing weapons key to turning around the war in Ukraine say military generals and other experts.

And Camden population 10300 is working to shore up a dwindling downtown and other amenities to maintain the area's most important industry -- the launchers missiles and defense weapons built by 2800 workers at Highland.

Lockheed's HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) made in Camden has ""been key to the turnaround in Ukraine no doubt about it"" said retired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark of Little Rock in an interview last week .

The former NATO Supreme Allied Commander now strategic adviser still has working ties to Ukraine. He had just returned from the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv.

HIMARS serves as ""a substitute for the Ukrainian Air Force"" Clark said. The missiles are satellite guided with a 200-pound explosive warhead that travels about 50 miles he said. It's accurate within about 10 feet military experts say.

""It's a very easy-to-use system usually mounted on a truck"" Clark said. ""It does what is called 'Shoot and Scoot.' It's very hard for the enemy to take out in advance. It's also able to get away after the rocket is fired.""

The artillery rocket system is built only at Lockheed's installation in south Arkansas according to Aaron Huckaby site director of Lockheed's Camden operations.

Military leaders including Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have appeared in international news reports in recent weeks applauding the HIMARS successes in Ukraine. HIMARS-launched missiles by last month had struck more than 400 Russian targets according to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Ukranian defense authorities have said the weapon has far exceeded expectations. It's been instrumental in reclaiming 1158 square miles of formerly Russian-occupied territory.

The attention has spilled over to HIMARS' builders in Arkansas and Camden as its city of origin.

A CBS ""Sunday Morning"" broadcast Sept. 4 talked about the weapon's production in rural south Arkansas. Politico a politics and policy news website on Sept. 9 examined Camden and Highland Industrial Park in a magazine-length article ""The Struggling Arkansas Town That Helped Stop Russia in Its Tracks.""

Two top military officials -- William LaPlante undersecretary for defense and Assistant Secretary of the Army Doug Bush -- visited Highland and Lockheed Martin late last month for an announcement regarding HIMARS and Lockheed's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS.

""We have received nearly $400 million to replenish HIMARS and GMLRS"" in defense department stockpiles LaPlante said according to a Camden News newspaper report. ""In addition we are planning nearly $200 million to expand and accelerate production...""

LaPlante and Bush also thanked Lockheed workers for the ""impact their efforts are having on the battlefield"" in Ukraine.

When Ramona Crain a real estate agent in Camden read the Politico article she was ""very pleased"" at the attention for the Camden area and its defense contractor industry.

""I had known by hearing around town that some of the industries were producing weapons for the fight in Ukraine"" she said. ""I am proud of their contribution. Many hard-working individuals are contributing to the success of these plants.""

Still Crain was surprised in some ways at all the recognition. The defense manufacturers don't get talked about a lot in Camden she said. And someone driving through the city wouldn't necessarily know the giant installation is a few miles outside.

""They're like a quiet group of defense industries that are doing a good job"" she said.

OUT OF THE CONVERSATION

Travel northeast from Camden on U.S. 79 Business cross the Ouachita River and rural countryside and -- at about East Camden population 798 -- turn onto U.S. 278 then Arkansas 274 to motor into Highland Industrial Park's 18780 acres.

At the entrance pass a hulking orange-and-tan billboard advertising the industrial park's 25-plus tenants.

Among the largest: Lockheed Martin -- ""We never forget who we're working for;"" Aerojet Rocketdyne; General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems; Raytheon Missiles and Defense.

A white-and-blue Lockheed building sits alongside the billboard across from the Highland Industrial Park administrative building.

The park also includes SAU Tech community college which trains workers including engineers and Arkansas' state fire and police training academies.

Most tenants according to John Schaffitzel the industrial park's president feed the defense industry.

Recent national attention on the Lockheed Martin Camden workforce ""has been nice"" site director Huckaby said in a digital interview .

His company which occupies more than 2000 acres at Highland has built more than 550 HIMARS ""from ground up -- truck chassis launcher that can fire various munitions"" he said. ""Some other sub-components are produced by our supply base. We have a number of suppliers across Arkansas and the nation.""

Ukraine has 16 HIMARS systems and wants more according to news accounts. The Pentagon announced plans last month to build 500. Lockheed doesn't divulge the HIMARS system's cost.

Huckaby said he like many employers worries about workforce development and retention. He wants to be more creative in identifying skilled and diverse talent while attracting and retaining the best.

Like many other companies at Highland Park Lockheed works four 10-hour days Monday through Thursday unless overtime is required. That helps workers who drive in from El Dorado Hot Springs Arkadelphia and other areas to work at the plants.

Pay and benefits are a big attraction.

Lockheed ranked the nation's largest defense contractor describes its pay only as ""competitive and fair."" Camden business leaders guess the lowest starting salary at $15 per hour with pay for engineers and other senior and highly trained staff climbing into ""six figures.""

Benefits surpass many Arkansas employers they say.

In addition to health insurance and a retirement plan Lockheed awards tuition assistance of $7500 to $12500 per year and up to four weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave according to a company spokesman.

Huckaby would like to see the Camden area offer workers better quality day care schools housing and other amenities which are issues his employees talk about ""on an ongoing basis.""

When he meets with state business and government leaders he sees ""a lot of momentum"" around growth in Northwest Arkansas and the Little Rock-Central Arkansas area. ""I think South Arkansas is missing from that conversation in a lot of ways"" he said.

Still Lockheed Camden has ""a healthy business and a healthy backlog"" Huckaby said. The company in June 2019 announced a $142 million investment in its Camden operation.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY

Defense contractors Lockheed Aerojet and others have built defense department weapons near Camden for decades.

Highland Industrial Park privately owned traces its history back to World War II as a U.S. Navy installation.

World-War-II era buildings still huddle close to high-tech factories. The site contains about 640 earth-covered munitions storage bunkers from its military days according to industrial park officials. They're handy for use by missile manufacturers.

After the Navy's Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot shut down in the late 1950s the Brown family of Texas bought 25000 acres Schaffitzel said. Highland Resources Inc. a subsidiary of Brown Engineering has operated the industrial park since 1968 he said.

Years ago Camden residents say it wasn't too difficult to get inside the defense industries at Highland Industrial Park if they had business there. But stepped-up security has made access more difficult. Lockheed and Aerojet declined Arkansas Democrat-Gazette requests to come inside their plants.

Defense manufacturing plants at Highland today sit behind individual wire-topped fences and guardhouses.

Lockheed and Aerojet are the largest tenants each with more than 1000 employees according to company spokesmen.

Aerojet's Camden operation on almost 2000 acres produces 75000 solid rocket motors a year to power defense systems including the Javelin Stinger Patriot Missile and other missile defense and tactical systems according to a company spokeswoman.

General Dynamics builds air-to-ground rockets and warheads. Raytheon constructs components for Navy missiles.

The Arkansas Economic Development Commission lists aerospace and aviation which includes defense industries as Arkansas' No. 1 export. The commission's website also describes Highland as one of the nation's ""fastest growing defense corridors.""

But unlike Walmart Tyson Foods JB Hunt Trucking and Dillard's Highland Industrial Park is hardly a familiar name across the state.

Asked how well-known is the Camden-area installation that builds launchers missiles and other military weapons Schaffitzel who has been on his job almost a year said he isn't sure.

""Is it highly known?"" he said. ""I don't know that they [defense contractors] want it to be highly known.""

Although state business and economic development officials know the industrial park well more widely it ""has been kind of a well-kept secret"" said James Lee Silliman executive director of the Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation.

""I don't know if that's by design.""

CAMDEN COMEBACK?

Decorative banners in downtown Camden recall the days of steamboats on the Quachita River.

Nearby a new mural on a renovated apartment building shouts rockets missiles and defense workers.

Camden settled in the early 1800s was a paper mill town for decades until International Paper Co. closed here in 2001. Now residents say it's a city that ""builds bombs.""

By all accounts the Camden area struggles with the same problems of other communities in the rural South and Midwest: declining population worries about access to education opportunities good-paying jobs medical care amenities.

Camden's defense workers are ""very important to the economy. They're transferring in buying homes settling in helping us build our community"" said Tammy George principal broker at Century 21 Campbell & Company.

She sees ""recent development and improvements in our downtown area new retail and restaurants. We're really pleased to see some growth.""

Still she doesn't know of any new homes currently under construction. And she remembers Camden in the 1970s nearly 50% larger with a population of about 15000 boasting stores such as Watts J.C. Penney Montgomery Ward Bealls and Gibson's that are gone now.

Lockheed's Huckaby said Camden's evolution may look better to those who have moved in more recently. The past 10 years have shown ""increases in the amenities and downtown"" residents tell him.

Highland Park's Schaffitzel said he pitches quality of life in the river city.

""The energy in downtown Camden is pretty amazing"" he said. ""They have First Friday events that draw 2000 or 3000 out in the streets."" He points to new restaurants like the Postmasters Grill in an historic renovated post office building.

'BOOM MODE'

Jim Golden who owns Jim Golden Ford in Camden counts on business from the defense companies and their workers. He also sees deeper inside the local military weapons industry than most residents as president of the Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development board.

In Golden's view ""the economy is fantastic in Camden right now due to the influx of aerospace jobs. It is very very good for Camden and very very good for this business. A lot of people work out there they buy vehicles from me I service their vehicles.""

""If it wasn't for these industrial plants this Ford place probably wouldn't be here"" he said. ""Or if it was it would be very small.""

Silliman Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation's executive director believes the area's military weapons builders are ""in a boom mode. The companies are all busy right now and have been. I can only speculate that a lot of the inventories will be replenished. It sounds like there's going to be steady production for a while"" he said.

Meanwhile attention on Camden's defense weapons industry and the city itself is mostly encouraging said many interviewed.

Clark whose family moved to Little Rock from Chicago when he was a child said defense industries chose Camden and Arkansas for good reasons.

After defense contractors were forced to shrink their operations at the end of the Cold War ""these companies decided where the best places were to concentrate their manufacturing. Camden fit the bill based on high-quality workforce and low cost"" he said.

""This is representative of the best of Arkansas"" Clark said. ""We have a lot of high-quality people here. They're stable love their families work hard and pay attention to what they're doing.""

Ford dealership owner Golden says that when foreign governments say they're grateful to Arkansas for life-saving weapons produced at Camden he's ""really proud"" of where he lives.

Defense plant workers and other area residents ""realize they're doing something special"" Golden said. ""They do.""

Extreme weather is already hitting many developing countries hard and forecast to wreak further catastrophe. Loss and damage – the issue of how to help poor nations suffering from the most extreme impacts of climate breakdown which countries cannot be protected against – is one of the most contentious problems in climate negotiations.

Some of the world’s most vulnerable countries have prepared a paper seen by the Guardian for discussion this week at the UN general assembly. It shows that poor countries are preparing to ask for a “climate-related and justice-based” global tax as a way of funding payments for loss and damage suffered by the developing world.

The funds could be raised by a global carbon tax a tax on airline travel a levy on the heavily polluting and carbon-intensive bunker fuels used by ships adding taxes to fossil fuel extraction or a tax on financial transactions.

The discussion paper notes advantages and drawbacks to each of these and the alternatives of raising funding from rich countries through the world’s development banks such as the World Bank the International Monetary Fund and the private sector.

All options for funding loss and damage are likely to be difficult for rich nations to agree to at a time of soaring fossil fuel costs rising food prices and a cost of living crisis around the world. Although rich countries agreed at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last year that there should be a framework for loss and damage there is no agreement on how it could be funded or who should contribute.

Nations will meet again for fresh talks called Cop27 in Egypt this November where loss and damage is again expected to be a major topic of discussion. At Cop26 negotiations were generally good-tempered and there was consensus on the need to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. However amid the geopolitical upheavals since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year’s talks are likely to be more fractious.

Damages to poor countries are expected to increase as the world heats up further. A separate submission to the UN by Antigua and Barbuda warns that increasing sea and air temperatures in the Caribbean could create a superstorm within years that would wreak £7.9bn of damage in the island nation alone six times its annual GDP.

Adelle Thomas the director of the climate change adaptation centre at the University of the Bahamas and a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said: “The case of Antigua and Barbuda underscores the need for ambitious climate action addressing [greenhouse gas emissions reduction] adaptation and loss and damage. For countries in the Caribbean that have contributed the least to climate change but are already struggling with current impacts it is critical that global warming is limited to 1.5C that funding for adaptation is significantly increased and made more accessible and that there is new and additional finance and support available to address loss and damage.”

The UN’s new top official on climate Simon Stiell was previously environment minister for the Caribbean island of Grenada and so is well versed in the needs and vulnerability of small island states. He is expected to lead robust discussions on the rapidly increasing threat of climate breakdown.

Walton Webson Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the UN and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States said: “[We] deserve to live without the looming fear of debt and destruction. Our islands are bearing the heaviest burden of a crisis we did not cause and the urgent establishment of a dedicated loss and damage response fund is key to sustainable recovery. We are experiencing climate impacts that become more and more extreme with each passing year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZXVyb3BlLWVuZXJneS1jcmlzaXMtZmFjdG9yaWVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Europe’s Energy Crisis Forces Factories to Go Dark,"The furnace heated to 1500 degrees Celsius was glowing red. Workers at the Arc International glass factory loaded it with sand that slowly pooled into a molten mass. Nearby on the factory floor machines transformed the shapeless liquid with a blast of hot air into thousands of delicate wine glasses destined for sale to restaurants and homes worldwide.

Nicholas Hodler the chief executive surveyed the assembly line shimmering blue with natural gas flames. For years Arc had been powered by cheap energy that helped turn the company into the world’s largest producer of glass tableware — and a vital employer in this working-class region of northern France.

But the impact of Russia’s abrupt cutoff of gas to Europe has doused the business with new risks. Energy prices have climbed so fast that Mr. Hodler has had to rewrite business forecasts six times in two months. Recently he put a third of Arc’s 4500 employees on partial furlough to save money. Four of the factory’s nine furnaces will be idled; the others will be switched from natural gas to diesel a cheaper but more polluting fuel.

“It’s the most dramatic situation we have ever encountered” Mr. Hodler said shouting to be heard over the din of clinking glasses. “For energy-intensive businesses like ours it’s crippling.”"

First launched last year the ‘F-list 2021’ highlighted over 90 agencies with fossil fuel clients on their books. This year the research was extended to include a greater focus on Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions showcasing the agencies actively under contract with the fossil fuel industry and taking this year’s running total up to 239 agencies.

The F-List 2022 scrutinizes sustainability statements from some of adland’s leading firms including WPP Omnicom Interpublic Group (IPG) Publicis Groupe Dentsu Edelman and Havas and compares them with the records of their clients.

Clean Creatives claims that while the report found that most agencies have erased references to fossil fuel clients from their websites its research teams were able to use web archives to uncover the links despite the sustainability commitments and net zero pledges most have made.

The report comes the same week as congressional democrats in the US held a hearing to discuss the role PR firms have played in blocking climate action and their contributions to the ”deceptive” and ”misleading” tactics used in their campaigns.

Within the advertising industry the movement against agencies working with ’dirty’ clients is growing. At this year’s Cannes Lions the complicated relationship took center-stage after ex-adman turned activist Gustav Martner interrupted the opening ceremony to hand back the Lions award he had won for his work with Volkswagen. Protests continued throughout the week as Greenpeace campaigners stormed WPP’s beach takeover and scaled the Palais (a central location in the city) to decry adland’s failure to sever ties with big oil.

The impact of advertising on the social license for major polluters to operate is now being addressed through policy. France recently became the first country to implement a fossil fuel advertising ban with companies facing a fine of up to €100000 ($100000) if they are in breach of the rules. Meanwhile Sydney Australia became the first urban center in APAC to do the same.

Here are the key findings

The 239 agencies from major industry holding companies and independent companies have recently worked with fossil fuel companies the report said. The vast majority of this work is not shared via agency channels.

At least 17 agencies are working for Saudi Aramco the world’s largest polluter. Interpublic Mediabrands agency Well7 and fellow IPG agencies McCann UM and Jack Morton all led substantial work for Aramco though all holding companies have some connection to the world’s largest oil company.

Coal giant Glencore is being referred to Australian regulators over its brand campaign that features EVs solar panels and wind turbines but doesn’t mention Glencore’s primary business – coal. This complaint follows the barring of two employees of Anacta Strategies from lobbying the Queensland government. Glencore secured a lucrative bailout while employing Anacta.

Edelman retains its role as the independent agency doing the most work for fossil fuel companies despite a pledge in early 2022 to review its client policy. Some small signs of progress at the PR giant can be seen but the company remains committed to working with polluters.

“Advertising and PR companies have had decades of warnings that their relationships with fossil fuel companies are harming their reputation and their clean clients“ says Clean Creatives’ executive director Duncan Meisel. ”Until now executives have chosen to ignore those warnings with serious consequences for the planet and their ability to attract and retain young talent.”

Recent research by Glimpse surveyed the attitudes of 100 UK creatives aged 18 to 30 and found that 63% said they were uncomfortable working on high-carbon clients.

Unsurprisingly the ad industry’s holding companies and major groups also feature prominently on the list.

WPP declined to comment on its inclusion but chief exec Mark Read recently told The Drum it had no plans to sever ties with Big Oil stating: ”In my view there’s no one solution to this. Yes energy companies are selling oil. But as consumers we’re all driving cars and flying in places. It requires a collective solution. Our industry should play a role in doing that – not to misrepresent what they are doing but if we can talk about what they’re doing in a fair and accurate way why wouldn’t we want to do that?”

The Drum also reached out to Interpublic (IPG) Ominicom Publicis Groupe and Dentsu but they had not responded at the time of publication.

There are four ETFs in Invesco’s lineup of equal weight S&P 500 strategies that have taken in over $100 million in year-to-date inflows as of September 16 including the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight ETF (RSP) the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Utilities ETF (RYU) the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF (RHS) and the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Energy ETF (RYE)

RSP has taken in $3.3 billion in net inflows year to date which is more than any other fund in Invesco’s ETF range according to VettaFi.

RSP is based on the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index and Invesco ESG S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSPE) is based on the S&P 500 Equal Weight ESG Leaders Select Index. RSPE’s underlying index is designed to measure the equal-weighted performance of securities included in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index that also meet ESG criteria while maintaining similar overall industry group weights as the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index according to the firm.

RYU has taken in $224 million in year-to-date inflows. RYU offers exposure to equities included in the S&P 500 Utilities Index which covers the following industries: electric utilities gas utilities multi-utilities and unregulated power and water utilities telecommunication service companies including fixed-line cellular wireless high bandwidth and fiber-optic cable networks.

RHS has seen $196 million in net inflows year to date. The fund offers exposure to the consumer staples sector of the U.S. economy but with a unique twist: the fund tracks an equal-weighted index meaning that component companies receive approximately equal allocations. That results in exposure that is considerably more balanced than other alternatives.

RYE has accreted $119 million in year-to-date inflows. The fund tracks an index that equally weights stocks in the energy sector of the S&P 500 Index. RYE has 23 equally weighted holdings with the top 10 holdings amounting to 49.10% of the fund as of September 15. Holdings include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) Targa Resources Corp (TRGP) ConocoPhillips (COP) Hess Corporation (HES) and ONEOK Inc (OKE).

An equal weighting methodology may be particularly appealing in the top-heavy energy industry where traditional cap weighting can result in significant concentration issues.

The current upward movement seems like a 5-wave sequence but we are not sure. Only one thing is for sure. That rising ruined the downtrend since it broke the last (4) Intermediate wave of the ((C)) Primary. Hence we expect to see a corrective mood with a 3-wave count mode in some support levels and after that is all right to take the trade with almost a risk/reward ratio of 1:2.

Going down respecting the weekly trading timeframe (log scale) at the end of the IV Cycle wave an impulse has unfolded as of a (1) – (5) Intermediate waves subdivision. Getting closer to the peak of ((B)) Primary of IV Cycle wave at $32.02 the ETF reached the $3064 price but it couldn’t exceed it.

Our market forecast says that we are in the middle of a corrective mood since the stock has already reached the 236% Fibonacci retracement level and still looking lower to complete the ((2)) Primary of the V Cycle wave. Hence we suggest staying out of the market for a while until we see a 3-wave sequence corrective pattern for this unfinished ((2)) Primary of the V Cycle wave. Besides it’s preferable to see the first two legs of an unfinished impulse rather than to trade against the main trend.

Zoomed in the current upward impulse as shown at the daily trading chart (log scale) this impulse as of the ((1)) Primary of the V Cycle is over in our point of view and the correction which started to go toward the first support of the 4 Minor of ((5)) Primary of the V Cycle wave at $2736 proved inefficient.

According to the Elliot Wave Principle’s guidelines after an extended fifth wave the market retraced to its second lesser degree wave which here is the respective 2 Minor of the (5) Intermediate of the ((1)) Primary of the V Cycle wave as well as simultaneously the (4) Intermediate of the ((1)) Primary of the V Cycle wave which was an expanding triangle.

So the unfinished ((2)) Primary of the V Cycle wave should fall further at $23.30 or at $20.84 or even at the $18.39 which are the 382% 50% and 618% multiples of the ((1)) Primary Fibonacci retracement levels respectively. The only ‘’must’’ is to form a 3-wave sequence only.

(NASDAQ:JKHY) Just Reported Third-Quarter Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. ( ) shareholders because the company has just released its latest third-quarter results and the shares gained 3.1% to US$169. Jack Henry & Associates reported in line with analyst predictions delivering revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models following these results.

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a notable 8.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 11% to US$5.75. In the lead-up to this report the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$181 suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. There's another way to think about price targets though and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Jack Henry & Associates with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$200 and the most bearish at US$170 per share. Still with such a tight range of estimates it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.

These estimates are interesting but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare both to the Jack Henry & Associates' past performance and to peers in the same . We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Jack Henry & Associates'historical trends as the 6.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 is roughly in line with the 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

With that in mind we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Jack Henry & Associates. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Jack Henry & Associates analysts - going out to 2026 and you can

The team declined his fifth-year option and gave him a ton of work in the preseason despite three straight years of at least 1200 yards from scrimmage.

But after two games it’s clear that Jacobs is the No. 1 running back for the Raiders and he is in a workhorse role.

In Week 1 Jacobs played 60 percent of the offensive snaps for the Raiders but only touched the ball 11 times. Some of that had to do with the game script as the Raiders were down early in that contest.

But in Week 2 Jacobs saw even more snaps and more work. He played 72 percent of the offensive snaps for the Raiders and had 20 touches on offense. While he wasn’t all that efficient (only 81 yards) he dominated the running back touches.

Zamir White was the only other running back to get a carry (one carry for two yards) and Ameer Abdullah was the only other running back to get a target (one reception for 23 yards). While Jacobs didn’t produce big numbers he did out touch the other running backs on the roster 20-2.

There will certainly be games where White and Abdullah get more touches but it’s clear that Jacobs is the top running back on this team. Look for the Raiders to continue to ride him this season as he is set to hit free agency after the season.

Levine who cared for her during the final weeks by her side.

Susan was born in Milwaukee on Nov. 19 1934 the daughter of sculptor and architect expert Katherine F. (Wescott) Jacobs and her husband Herbert Austin Jacobs a former Milwaukee Journal and then Capital Times newspaper journalist. Susan dedicated herself to living enriching and preserving the legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright. For many she embodied it and its values. Her involvement with Wright began at an early age.

Her childhood was spent in Madison where her parents built the first of two Frank Lloyd Wright homes. The Jacobs House of 1936-37 441 Toepfer Ave. in Madison was the first of Wright’s Usonian houses and is now on the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) World Heritage list.

The equally innovative second Jacobs House where Susan spent her teenage years was built on a circular plan around a sunken garden at 3995 Shawn Trail in the Town of Middleton in 1946-49 and is considered a precursor of sustainable design.

Upon graduating in 1953 with a degree in art education from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where she was president of Gamma Phi Beta sorority Susan moved to New York City NY to study music and work for Atheneum Books publisher Alfred A. Knopf.

Wright invited Susan and her then-husband David Coe Wheatley (a St. Louis Missouri native and former Taliesin apprentice who she married on March 30 1957 in Madison.) to join the Fellowship in 1957. From 1958 until 2002 Susan actively participated in Fellowship life in both Wisconsin and Arizona where she and her second husband Kenneth Burton Lockhart (an Iowa native who she married on Sept. 29. 1961 in Phoenix AZ.) built a cottage in the desert above Taliesin West in Scottsdale AZ. Susan served on the Fellowship’s senior teaching faculty directed the bi-annual Taliesin Day Symposium and was Program Coordinator for arts and cultural events pianist for the Taliesin chamber group and lead dancer in the Taliesin Festival of Music and Dance.

She was arguably the most prominent face of Taliesin to the outside world connecting people to the community and vice versa. Susan served on the board of Jazz in Arizona and the Scottsdale Arts & Culture Visiting Committee. In the 1980s she became senior graphic designer for Taliesin Architects and was responsible for a remarkable suite of designs for Phoenix’s Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Her own art including sculpture and architectural glass both leaded and sandblasted and porcelain and stoneware place settings for Edith Heath and Tampopo featured abstract geometric patterns based on nature.

Susan joined the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy board in 1996 and left the Fellowship in 2003 to live in France and in Cambridge MA with her third husband Neil Levine. She served as president of the F.L.W. Conservancy from 2009 to 2011 and became the first executive editor of the Save Wright magazine which she revamped and expanded into new territories. She also designed the Conservancy’s glass Wright Spirit Award given annually to recognize individuals and organizations that have worked to preserve Wright’s legacy. Most recently Susan co-authored a book to appear later this year titled “Wright’s Jacobs Houses: Experiments in Modern Living.”

Susan and Neil got together in 2002 and in the following year she left Taliesin and moved to Cambridge MA to join him. They were married in 2007 and up until her death last month they spent much of the year in France either in their apartment in Paris or their country house in the western part of Burgundy known as the Morvan.

She is survived by her husband Neil Levine; her stepdaughter Leslie L. Bisharat of Granite Bay CA; her stepson Brian Lockhart of Tucson AZ. and two younger siblings her sister Elizabeth Jacobs Aitken and her brother William W. Jacobs. She was preceded in death by her parents Herb (May 20 1987) and Katherine (Sept. 16 1995).

“Susan was a joyful forward-thinking Trustee of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation” said the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation in a statement. “She brought her enthusiasm for creativity to numerous programs at Taliesin and Taliesin West and in separate pursuits like the Bach Dancing and Dynamite Society a first-class annual music festival held in Madison.”

Memorial services will be held at a later time in Scottsdale AZ. and in Madison.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoY29hc3R0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L2dsb2JhbC1sZWFybmluZy1jaGFydGVyLXNjaG9vbC1uZXctYmVkZm9yZC1tYXJrcy0yMC15ZWFycy8xMDM2NDc0MDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Learning Charter School in New Bedford marks 20 years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoY29hc3R0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L2dsb2JhbC1sZWFybmluZy1jaGFydGVyLXNjaG9vbC1uZXctYmVkZm9yZC1tYXJrcy0yMC15ZWFycy8xMDM2NDc0MDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FA707C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Here is the full transcript of the interview lightly edited for clarity:

Q: I’ll start with something simple. What is your administration’s top accomplishment that you are most proud of in the past year? And what area do you think you could improve the most on?

A: Yeah so first of all thank you for taking time. We have the largest bond deal in the history of the city of Chicago $1.25 billion bond deal. We’re gonna build homes and create real economic development for people. It’s unprecedented investment. That’s what I promised I would do when I became mayor and we’ve done that.

A quarter of a billion dollars to address the unhoused crisis in this city; $100 million for violence prevention. We’re going to open up two mental health clinics this year. This is the result of course from two administrations ago shutting down mental health clinics. We abolished the subminimum wage in the city of Chicago. Black and brown women 100000 workers are going to get a raise. We have the most substantive paid time off in any major city in this country 1.3 million workers have additional days that they will be able to take off as a result of our work.

We hired 20% more young people for summer jobs. We added an additional $76 million on top of that. So we’re in a position to hire 28000 young people for summer jobs. First time in the history of Chicago where you have a community safety deputy mayor. It’s a big deal particularly when it comes to how we address community safety in this city.

So between the bond deal unprecedented quarter of a billion dollars for the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention of course abolishing subminimum wage of course creating paid time off for workers opening up mental health clinics the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago and we’ve done that within the first year of our administration. So I’m very proud that we’ve been able to accomplish everything that I promised that I would do when I ran for office. We’ve accomplished those.

Q: What do you see as the area that most needs improvement within your administration?

A: Well I mean look we’ve had 40 years of gross neglect and disinvestment within the city of Chicago right? And we’re talking about real severe disinvestment. I’m not sure if either one of you were here during the time in which schools were closed. It’s a very profound lasting impact that it has had on the people of Chicago. And when mental health clinics are shuttered that creates a lot of frustration that leaves a gaping hole right? And so part of my responsibility of course is to address the age-old systems of failure and to build a better stronger safer Chicago and that is something that I’m committed to doing. That’s what the people of Chicago elected me to do.

Q: If you could go back to May 15 2023 knowing what you know now about how the migrant crisis would unfold what would you do differently?

A: Well again thank you for acknowledging the fact that I inherited this crisis. When I was sworn in there were people who were sleeping on floors in police districts. They were sleeping on floors in airports right? You had no structure no order at the border and the governor of Texas was committed to creating chaos.

What we have done though as a result of that there are no more people sleeping on floors in police districts. We’ve cleared out the airports. We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million through our work of renegotiating contracts that I inherited.

Having reflected over the last year I wish that Congress would actually do its part and pass substantive immigration reform policies and alleviate this responsibility that has been placed on the backs of municipal government which it is not designed to do. And so that is an area that in retrospect had those types of investments been made — whether it’s the city of Chicago or Denver or New York or anywhere else in this country that Gov. Abbott has attacked and targeted — we could be in a much more — we could be in a better position as a country if the federal government would have acted.

Q: As a candidate you once said “Too often the politics of Chicago it forces communities to fight over one pie. My philosophy is: Let’s just make more pies.” As a mayor you have consistently said that Chicago was out of money for migrants while other governments as you just alluded to aren’t helping enough. Was your outlook back then perhaps too optimistic?

A: Again the $1.25 billion bond deal this is again the largest investment that we have experienced as a city. That’s 20 times the amount of dollars that we have made for the migrant mission within the latest investment. What it displays is that you actually can do both and I mean it’s a clear example of doing both. As far as my general optimism about the city of Chicago here’s the most important thing to remember: I came into office with a clear agenda to invest in people — a $1.25 billion bond deal a quarter of a billion dollars into the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention. You know we have established a brand-new office dedicated to those who are returning residents from jails and incarceration. It’s never happened before.

These investments could have been made two administrations ago it could have been three administrations ago. They didn’t do it. I did. And that’s why I’m optimistic in this moment because everything that I said that we need to do as a city together we are doing that. We’re investing in people. And we’re addressing age-old systems that have failed the people of Chicago for too long.

Q: We hear that (Deputy Mayor of Community Safety) Garien Gatewood and a violence interrupter were on the scene Saturday attempting to de-escalate a clash between CPD and (the School of the Art Institute of Chicago) protesters. Did CPD ignore the wishes of the fifth floor when they moved on the protesters anyway?

A: The most important thing here for everyone to remember is that I’m a strong advocate for the First Amendment and particularly protests. I’ve been a part of demonstrations multiple demonstrations. What we also need to make sure that happens is that we keep people safe and that’s the most important thing here.

And so the work to de-escalate is work that is ongoing. The work to keep people safe that’s the most important element here. And we’ve done both of those things. We’re keeping people safe. We’re protecting people’s First Amendment right. And when things get to be more intense we’re pushing for greater de-escalation.

Q: Was the final response the outcome — which led to dozens of arrests — was that necessary?

A: Well in some instances — and I’ve been a part of these demonstrations — in some instances arrests are part of the objective. I’ll say it like that. I’ve taken arrest before. It’s not unprecedented for demonstrators to take arrest. The most important thing though here is that the First Amendment? Protected. Keeping people safe it’s the primary goal and we’ve done both of those.

Q: Let’s talk about the pace of your personnel appointments. For example the ZBA (Zoning Board of Appeals) vacancy that you could have filled upon taking office ultimately cost your administration the approval of a homeless shelter in Uptown. Do you regret not acting sooner in that case and others?

A: Our appointments are working well. We have the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago; 60% of my administration are women. We have more brown folks represented in my administration more Black folks represented in my administration and we’re very proud of that. Whether it’s (Public Health Commissioner) Dr. Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige her leadership (Planning) Commissioner (Ciere) Boatright (Housing Commissioner Lissette) Castañeda the first chief homelessness officer in the history of the city of Chicago (Sendy Soto).

All of our appointments really speak to the values of our administration building better stronger safer communities. And we’re doing it in an equitable just way. And so we’re going to continue to make sure that we get it right and I’m very proud of the administration that I put together.

Q: Speaking of identity: During a Lunar New Year celebration you raised some eyebrows when you said the 11th Ward is one that “has been known for its racism.” I bring this up because some of your critics worry this language is alienating. Are their concerns valid? Or is your description of the 11th Ward fair and necessary?

A: Well I think that the entire city of Chicago certainly no one is going to deny the fact that we’ve had deep segregation in this city. And the fact that for the first time in the history of Chicago you have an Asian American representing the 11th Ward that shows that there’s tremendous progress that’s being made.

And so we have to address the harsh reality in this city that we are hypersegregated that there has been racism expressed in this city whether it be through school closures whether it be the shuttering of mental health clinics whether it be cutting off transportation stops and lines through various communities redlining the push-out of people gentrifying communities. You know these are real issues that we’ve had to face over the course of decades now.

And it’s incumbent upon all of us in this city to address racism that exists around the city while also making sure that we’re building capacity with a variety of voices and perspectives and experiences that can ultimately help build a more unified city. And that’s what we’re doing.

Q: The day after you won in April you told our colleague that you’ve never called 911 before which is a sentiment that other South and West siders have shared with me from time to time. But after ShotSpotter goes away 911 calls will presumably be the main alert system for first responders. Do you envision residents will have to adapt to calling 911 more to fill that gap?

A: Well let me just say where violence has been most pervasive particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago these communities call 911 more than any other group and that’s well-documented. The challenge that we have in this city is that we have not had administrations that were committed to investing in people. I’m committed.

Look community safety is a top priority for me and it’s on the minds of all Chicagoans. Homicides are down in the city. Shootings are down in the city. The 35 most violent beats in the city of Chicago where over 50% of the violent crime occurs in those neighborhoods. Homicides are down 35% shootings are down 31%. The work that we have to continue to do to build a better stronger safer Chicago has to be very clear about how we invest in people.

If 911 is our response to community safety then we already have a failed strategy. That is not my strategy. I’m not committed to failing. I’m committed to investing in people and that’s what I’m doing.

Q: Mayor you’re a champion of the progressive movement here in Chicago. What has shifted in the mood and morale of the movement while you’ve been in office?

A: Well there’s a lot to be excited about. You know again paid time off. We’re talking about 1.38 million people. That’s part of the progressive agenda. We abolished the subminimum wage. It has its vestiges of course in slavery. So Black and brown women we’re talking about 100000 workers who are primarily the workforce of restaurants in particular they’re all going to get raises.

Treatment Not Trauma that policy had been lingering in the city of Chicago for years. We got it done within the first year of my administration. You know again this $1.25 billion bond deal right? We’re talking about $625 million dollars to build homes another $625 million for economic development and resources workforce development as well.

I mean this is a part of the progressive agenda that has been stagnant for now an entire generation. We’ve been able to move with expediency. This is an exciting time for the city of Chicago as we build a better stronger safer city through the lens of progressive politics through the lens of working people. And that we’re very proud of.

Q: That same movement was delivered a pretty big setback when Bring Chicago Home lost and its opponents sought to tie the referendum vote to you. Do you think that association hurt the referendum? And do you think you could have done more to back Bring Chicago Home and get it over the finish line?

A: Well we know there were some legal restraints that I had. I was not able to campaign for it. But let’s be very clear: We dedicated a quarter of a billion dollars to homelessness. We have for the first time in the history of Chicago a homelessness officer. Again this bonds deal was designed to build homes and we’re doing that. We’ve already built 100 affordable housing units since I’ve been in office.

There are another 700 that are in the pipeline as we speak. Look the same forces — and thank you because your publication actually is the source of it — the same forces that worked to stop (Cook County Board President) President John Stroger from moving this same agenda those same forces were in full effect to push back against the will of the people.

The bottom line is this it’s the most important thing: We have to deal with the homelessness crisis in this city and that’s what I’m doing. And so individuals or anyone of interests that are not committed to addressing the homelessness crisis perhaps they have to dig a little bit deeper and understand why they’re actually opposing that because the people of Chicago want us to address homelessness. So in other words their attack was against the people of Chicago.

Q: You have a reputation of being a pretty affable guy but also one common criticism of your administration has been struggles with relationships with some other governments City Council maybe the governor as well. How do you respond to that criticism? Do you think there’s room for improvement there?

A: Well look at what we’ve accomplished. Look at what we’ve accomplished together. Working with City Hall. Again the most substantive paid time-off ordinance in the country abolishing subminimum wage passing Treatment Not Trauma. We’re moving on the execution of plowing the sidewalks. We’re building affordable housing. We have a bond deal.

Working with the state and the county we put together an operation to address this migrant mission. We’ve done that together. Everything that I said that we needed to do that we needed to do it together we’ve accomplished that. And so my relationship with City Council with other executives I’m very proud of the work that we’ve accomplished and what we’ve done together.

Q: You campaigned on a platform of racial justice and unity. But on the floor of the City Council many aldermen especially Black aldermen describe a Chicago and City Council as more and more racially divided. Do you agree with that narrative?

A: Yeah well look 40 years of disinvestment. Whether it’s North Lawndale Englewood Roseland Austin Garfield Park every single crisis that we are dealing with right now I inherited it. There’s not one crisis right now that I caused. Not one.

And I’ve been on the front line fighting for education fighting for mental health services fighting to create more job opportunities for people and we’re doing that. Again we’re talking about the largest investment from a bond deal in the history of Chicago a $1.25 billion bond 100 affordable housing units that have already been built 700 right now in the pipeline.

This new Office for Reentry returning residents will now have a place where an entire department coordinates across city departments and sister agencies; $10 million in home repairs right now for families particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago. And so we are addressing what we inherited. Forty years of neglect and within one year we have made hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and now the largest bond deal in the history of Chicago to address the neglect.

That’s what I was purposed to do: Build homes create economic opportunities for Black Chicago. There are more Black folks in my administration than in the history of this city. And no one else lost because of it. And 60% of my administration made up of women. I’m very proud of the work that we’ve done together.

Q: There’s no doubt that you’ve had a lot of big bold ideas in the agenda that you campaigned on. Those ideas also cost a lot of money. Out of all the other revenue ideas that you floated — a head tax financial transactions jet fuel hotels — which one do you think has the most realistic path to passing in this term?

A: Well the key is what do we ultimately want to do right? Do we want to build more homes that are affordable? Do we want to really create more pathways for our young people? Do we want to make sure that our public education system is fully supported? That’s the real question.

And the other question that we have to answer is: What happens if we don’t invest in those key areas? And so my approach is put the ideas on the table. You give people an opportunity to debate them to discuss them. And then we come to consensus together. Building a better stronger safer Chicago is going to require investments bottom line. I’ve made that very clear.

With the quarter-billion dollars into the unhoused the $1.25 billion bond deal the $100 million for violence prevention. Everyone says that they want to address these issues in our city the segregation the disinvestment. Turns out if you believe in something you’re willing to pay for it.

Q: But out of that process you just laid out what stage are you at in terms of deciding what to prioritize in that revenue package?

A: Those conversations are ongoing. You both know that we have a subcommittee dedicated to revenue. I created that for that very purpose. Look my responsibility in this moment is to bring people together and I’ve done it. I’ve done it consistently. And that’s why this subcommittee exists so that we can have these substantive conversations about what it’s going to take to right the wrongs that we inherited.

We’re talking about 40 years of gross neglect in the city of Chicago. I really want to just drive that point home — 40 years of neglect. It has caused tremendous harm to people. Do you know what that’s like to wake up and you’re not sure if your school is going to exist? Or if it’s fully funded? Do you know what it’s like to wake up and you’re unhoused?

I mean these are severe issues that the people of Chicago are facing and that’s why I’m dedicated to opening up mental health centers that’s why I’ve been pushing so hard for this investment around the unhoused. It’s why this $1.25 billion bond deal is a start in that right direction. And we’ve accomplished all of this in less than a year. Keep that in mind.

It has not even been a year yet. And everything that I said that I would do bring people together to build a better stronger safer Chicago every single platform point we’ve addressed it. And then to your question around our revenue sources there’s an entire committee dedicated to building an infrastructure of revenue that doesn’t place the burden on everyday people.

Q: Have you vetted or looked at potential replacements for CTA President Dorval Carter?

A: Well as you know discussing personnel issues I actually find that to be irresponsible and I’ve said that repeatedly. And so what I’m committed to doing right now is making sure that our ridership continues to go up which it has. We have hired more people which we’ve done that I’ve made a commitment to doing that. Our better streets for buses it’s the first initiative of its kind to build a better street signal sidewalk infrastructure. These are all investments that I have put forward in order to build a CTA that we can be proud of. And again as far as personnel matters I don’t discuss those publicly.

Q: Why?

A: Because it’s not responsible. Should your employer discuss individuals’ employment status out loud about who they’re going to fire and keep?

Q: In fairness though these are also employees not just of yours but of the city right? The CTA president also serves Chicagoans and they have a lot of questions about him and all of the appointments that you make.

A: Having questions about how we build a transportation system that ultimately meets the needs and demands of the people of Chicago those questions are welcome. Determining who I get to fire and hire I find that to be irresponsible and I won’t discuss personnel matters publicly.

Q: Out of all the current CTU demands — 9% raises housing assistance dual-language expansion sports and fine arts at each school more sustainable community schools abortion and gender-affirming care coverage and more — what do you already know that you could say yes to?

A: Well look my vision for public education has been made very clear. I want every single child to have what my children have right? We’re talking about manageable class sizes arts libraries librarians access to the trades. You know that’s what a public education system should entail.

Now I’m a firm believer in sustainable community schools and primarily because it gives you know real ownership of the school community over the actual school. And where there are areas where there’s alignment with my vision and what is being negotiated in the contract we’ll lean into that. And where there are areas that are disjointed we’ll have to work through it. We’ll just have to work through it.

The public education system in this city is another area where there’s been gross neglect. And my job in this moment is to lay out a vision that working families want in their school system. Now who better to help lay out that vision than someone who actually relies upon the school system? I’m the first mayor in the history of Chicago to send their children to the public schools in Chicago. I have a real vested interest in ensuring that every single family can feel proud of their school and that their school is fully supported and resourced.

Now what we also have to recognize is that the state of Illinois conservatively owes us the people of Chicago $1 billion. One billion dollars. And so I’m going to be working with our partners in Springfield to ensure that the people of Chicago get what they deserve.

Q: How does your lived experience as a CPS parent inform some of your education decisions and positions? Can you name a specific policy where you thought about your kids and made your decision?

A: Yeah just access to the arts. Access to a library and a librarian. When I taught in middle school the level of research that I asked my middle schoolers to engage in was pretty substantial. It was. I wanted them to really dig deeper into their lessons. Not to have any library or a librarian I could not imagine teaching at the time in which I taught and not have the ability to take my children to the library.

And that’s something as simple and as fundamental as a librarian I just want to emphasize this because sometimes I think we brush past that really fast. Just think about your own personal journeys: What if you did not have a library or librarian to reference as you developed your skill set to become the professionals that you are today? Children in Chicago are being denied a library and a librarian.

The second thing is class sizes. When the school was closed when I taught we inherited an entire school. Our class sizes ballooned. When you are a middle school teacher there are 35 38 children in your classroom and you literally have desks stuffed in corners it is almost — it is impossible to have full engagement with 35 38 children in your classrooms. Impossible. We managed it but it’s impossible. That’s the second thing.

The third thing is this: The number of children who experience trauma every single day because they were unhoused their parents are unemployed or underemployed and when that trauma shows up in your classroom I can tell you they’re not always thinking about the causes of the American Revolution or comma splices or the author’s main point. They’re thinking about food. They’re thinking about sleep. Those are the three areas that I can tell you emphatically as a public school teacher if you don’t address those dynamics you can’t say that you’re really in for the public good.

Q: If I can zoom in on a specific moment in your migrant crisis response. You know the Brighton Park base camp plan generated some of the biggest pushback you’ve seen against your administration. Looking back do you think that set you back with building trust on that issue? And is there a lesson to be learned from that?

A: Well again the chaos at the border has still not gone addressed. Part of the challenge in this moment is the frustration that the people of Chicago have we’re not giving enough attention to where that frustration is really based out of. You have a governor of Texas who was out of control.

We had 15000 migrants in shelters at its height. There are 8000 now. We’ve saved the taxpayers $200 million. Do you know not a bus has arrived in the city of Chicago since the end of December? Not one bus. Why? Because we put forth a structure that I promised that I would do to create a real operation that’s centered around people’s humanity.

Look I’ve said from the very beginning this mission is unsustainable for a local municipality. Because local government is not designed to address an international migrant crisis. We are being woefully neglected by the federal government and primarily because you have a former president who is controlling the Republican Party.

And so what I’ve done is created an infrastructure that is operationalized that is centered around people’s dignity and humanity under severe circumstances in which we don’t have control of what’s happening at the border. We continue to work hard to save taxpayer dollars while still making investments. All of the investments that I’ve already laid out I’m sure you probably can repeat them.

Q: If I could walk down memory lane one of the first things I remember you telling me right after George Floyd’s murder is “I wanted to destroy every bit of a system that would permit such a heinous crime.” Obviously as mayor now you oversee a large police department you have a security detail and you’ve had to stand behind the CPD seal at pressers. Has it been strange to grapple with this adjustment so soon after living through the rawness of 2020 and being a Black man?

A: Well the system that we are referring to is quite frankly it’s a system of oppression. And that manifests across the board. I just talked to you very candidly about how the education system has also been an oppressive system right? We know that from the Civil Rights Movement the movement really began to take form around the fight for public transportation.

Policing is no different than any other system that has been mired by an oppressive ideology. And it is still my desire to dismantle the oppressive structures that prevent us from experiencing justice.

Look law enforcement has a responsibility to serve people and to protect. But it is not the responsibility alone of law enforcement to address some of these other critical issues. We continue to rely upon the police system for everything and that’s a problem.

You know as far as grappling with the contradictions that exist within our society that’s something that we all work through whether you’re a woman a woman of color a Black man. Advocating for better structures that have historically left marginalized people behind that is the optimism that perhaps you speak of. If our people Black and brown people women would have given up on these systems you and I wouldn’t be here. And so we continue to push these systems to respond to the needs of people.

The most important thing to note here is that the progress that we have made in less than a year the billions of dollars of investment dealing with the migrant crisis bringing down homicides and shootings moving forward with our progressive agenda that really speaks to working people and the people of Chicago that’s the part that I’m leaning into most. It’s an exciting time for the city of Chicago and I’m looking forward to the work that I will do with every resident of this city together. Thank you both.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpZ2JsdWV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTIvMjQxNTQ0NDYvY2FuLWdpYW50cy10aGVvLWpvaG5zb24tYmUtYmV0dGVyLXByby10aGFuLWNvbGxlZ2UtcGxheWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Giants' Theo Johnson be better pro than college player?,"Theo Johnson’s production as a tight end at Penn State was modest with his 34 catches at Penn State in 2023 being his best season.

The Giants drafted the 6-foot-6 259-pound Johnson in Round 4 No. 107 overall. Can Johnson develop into a more productive NFL player than he was as a college player?

“It’s really exciting for me because I think I have a super high ceiling. I think I haven’t even scratched the surface of what I’m capable of. I’m really looking forward to proving every day that I’m out here” Johnson said Saturday after the second of two rookie mini-camp practices.

“I think I have tremendous room to improve. I think I can grow a lot more than where I’m at right now. I think that’s why I’m so excited. I’m coming in here with a learning mindset. I want to develop respect from my teammates and my coaches. I think that’s going to help me continue to grow and improve. But I’m super excited to get to work and get going here because I think I have a potential to be a really special player here.”

The Giants certainly hope so. They traded for veteran Darren Waller a year ago hoping he could be a difference-making tight end. After one mediocre season in which leg injuries limited his availability Waller might retire.

That likely is part of the reason the Giants drafted Johnson.

“I think the big thing for me is consistency. Being consistent” Johnson said. “I’ll flash a lot of really good things on tape but it’s putting all that stuff together every single snap that’s going to help me reach my potential.

“Consistency comes from repetition doing it a lot and then being very detail oriented. Being very honest with yourself when you’re watching film and then having a coach that’s going to hold you to that standard every single day and not let the little stuff slide. I think that’s a big part of having consistent technique.”

Johnson understands that tight end is not a simple position to play.

“Tight end is a lot even at the college level. You’re just asked to do so much and that’s why I think it’s a great position” Johnson said. “Everything you’re asked to do it’s very unique. It’s not just a one-tool guy. The best tight ends are able to do everything.

Look out for Jordaine Johnson!!!

Johnson who missed the entire outdoor season last spring with a broken toe left lots of smoke at Schools Stadium on Saturday when he produced one of the greatest and electrifying sprint triples in state history at the Super Essex Conference Championships in Newark.

Johnson a junior at East Orange Campus started off his day by running a meet record 10.53 in the trials of the American Division 100-meter dash No. 5 in the state this season. He followed that up by winning the 100 dash final in 10.70.

Johnson returned to the track 15 minutes later to finish first in the 400 in 47.91 No. 2 in the state this season. Later in the day Johnson completed the sprint trifecta with his best performance of them all when he blazed his way to a meet and Essex County record 21.04 which is No. 8 in NJ history for all conditions (there was no wind gauge).

How rare and remarkable is Johnson's triple!!!?

I can only find three other sprinters in state history who ran under 10.55 under 21.10 and under 48.00 in their high school careers!!!

Olympic gold medalist Dennis Mitchell a 1984 graduate of Edgewood ran 10.47 21.06 and 46.02. The late Mario Heslop of Franklin (Class of 2019) went 10.33 20.74 and 46.73 and Shamali Whittle of Hamilton North (Class of 2022) had high school PR's of 10.48 20.55 and 47.82.

That's some fast company that Johnson joined!!

And Johnson might be the first to ever go under 10.55 under 21.10 and sub 48 on the same day!! Heslop and Whittle accomplished their times on different days. Still checking on Mitchell.

Here's some more info on Johnson's 21.04 in the 200.

Johnson's 21.04 broke the Essex County automatic time record for all conditions of 21.22 that Maxwell Booker of Essex Catholic ran when he finished second to Danny Johnson of Rahway (21.03) at the 2000 Meet of Champions at Frank Jost Field in South Plainfield. The times by Booker and Johnson were wind-aided as they were run with a tailwind of 2.3 meters per second.

In case you're wondering the state record in the 200 for all-conditions is a wind-aided 20.51 (2.8 meters per second) by Antonio Tarantino of Paul VI in the trials of the 2018 New Balance Nationals Championships at North Carolina A&T in Greensboro N.C. The wind-legal state record is 20.75 that Shamali Whittle ran in the trials of the 200 at the 2021 Outdoor National Championships at Hayward Field in Oregon.

The Hoover City Council on Monday night declared a stormwater drainage problem near the intersection of U.S. 31 and Lorna Road near the Riverchase Crossings shopping center to be a public safety hazard and public nuisance and directed two property owners to correct the problem.

Hoover City Administrator Allan Rice said the drainage problem on private property has caused substantial flooding on U.S. 31 on multiple occasions over many months making half or all of the major thoroughfare impassable during heavy rain events.

The problem is that a stormwater drainage pipe that runs between Walgreens and the Panda Express restaurant has been collapsed for a long time which led to the closure of the Panda Express drive-through and a fence being erected around it Rice said.

TREA Riverchase Village the owner of the Riverchase Village shopping center since that time has been pumping stormwater out of the underground storm sewer system through an above-ground pipe that runs between Walgreens and Panda Express and depositing the water at a storm drain on the state right of way along U.S. 31 Rice said.

“That inlet is not designed for that” Rice said. “That’s not where that water was intended to go. It won’t take the volume.”

During heavy rains U.S. 31 is flooding and Hoover police are having to block the highway and redirect traffic elsewhere because it has become a public safety hazard and public nuisance Rice said.

Motorists shouldn’t be denied use of U.S. 31 and Hoover police shouldn’t be put at avoidable risk by blocking a major road he said.

The property that contains the Walgreens and Panda Express is owned by Rogina Investment Corp. and that company and TREA Riverchase Village are involved in litigation regarding who is responsible for repairs and that litigation seems to be locked down without any progress toward resolution Rice said.

“I think it’s going to take regulatory action on the part of the city to try to get that ball rolling” Rice told the council at its work session this past Thursday.

The Hoover City Council on Monday night authorized the city attorney to take civil action to abate the public nuisance.

Aaron McLeod an attorney for TREA Riverchase Village told the City Council before it voted that the city itself is contributing a substantial amount of stormwater runoff from Lorna Road and Data Drive into the shopping center’s stormwater system.

The city bears a significant amount of responsibility for the use or misuse of the failed stormwater pipe and expense of any repairs McLeod said.

Wilson Green an attorney for Rogina Investment Corp. said that company’s position is that the water running through the pipe on its property is not coming from Rogina’s property but from TREA Riverchase Village’s property and from public rights of way.

Rogina Investment believes the storm sewer system there is a publicly dedicated system and is being publicly used Green said. Rogina believes it is inappropriate to declare this problem a public nuisance because it’s the city’s responsible to operate and maintain that system.

In other business Monday night the Hoover City Council authorized the mayor to apply for federal assistance with flood mitigation for any residential properties that appear to be eligible for such assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

This would allow any homeowners who believe their flooding situation is so bad that their property qualifies to be bought out by the government to apply for such relief Rice said. A homeowner must meet certain criteria to qualify and city officials will begin sharing that information soon he said.

Rice said city engineers believe there probably are only about 12 to 15 homes in Hoover that might qualify to be bought out based on previous observations.

For properties that the federal governments deems are qualified the federal government would pay 75% of the cost for flood mitigation and the city and/or the property owner would be responsible for the other 25% Rice said.

The Hoover City Council also on Monday agreed to pay Avery Landscape & Associates $244243 to repair a sewer main and Inverness Point Lake spillway at the Inverness Nature Park just south of the Inverness Point subdivision.

During a rain even in the past year the spillway on park property washed away causing sediment erosion onto adjacent property and leaving the sewer main line sagging and exposed City Engineer Chris Reeves said.

The sewer line is not leaking but it needs to be stabilized and the spillway needs to be restored and sediment erosion remediated Reeves said.

Avery Landscape & Associates should be able to start the project within the first two weeks of October and has 60 days to complete it he said.

Frankfurt: Choked by soaring energy and wood pulp costs German toilet paper maker Hakle is turning to waste from coffee production to stay afloat and help the environment.Just two years ago at the height of the coronavirus pandemic  the firm profited from a stampede of consumers rushing to stock up on essentials.But with the health crisis abating Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked skyrocketing energy costs forcing Hakle to file for insolvency recently.Innovation could now be the key to survival.Huge quantities of coffee grounds are produced every year by the European food industry and Hakle has found a way to transform the waste into material to make loo roll.The first rolls using the new process were produced at the Duesseldorf-based company's factory last week Hakle's chief marketing officer Karen Jung told AFP.""The goal is 20 to 25 percent"" of coffee grounds constituting the material for making the paper replacing wood pulp said Jung adding the company was working towards reaching those levels.""That does not sound like a lot -- but it means that a quarter fewer trees have to be used"" added Jung whose company entered insolvency proceedings in September due to surging energy costs.Hakle sees a strong economic case. The price of wood pulp -- which is in high demand in China the world's biggest consumer -- has risen rapidly since 2020.It is not the first time that the firm has taken an unusual approach to producing loo paper.Two years ago it used grass grown in the Rhineland to make toilet paper said Jung who runs the business with her husband.- Roller-coaster ride - The company has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent times.After 2020 when it raked in close to 80 million euros ($80.2 million) in sales and made a profit of about 700000 euros it is now seeing its fortunes reverse as costs explode.""The cost of a roll of toilet paper depends 80 percent on pulp energy and logistics -- and all three of these factors are driven by world markets"" said Jung.The price of gas rose up to 400 euros per megawatt hour and up to 1000 euros for electricity a heavy blow for the firm's Duesseldorf factory which consumes about 100 gigawatt hours a year.With costs that ""increase tenfold in the short term"" that ""really becomes a problem"" said Jung.The survival of Hakle which is nearly a century old is now at stake.- 'Formula 1 race' - It has had several different owners over the past 40 years including US consumer goods giant Kimberly-Clark and a Luxembourg private equity firm before Volker Jung acquired 50 percent of the shares in 2019 with a new entrepreneurial approach that favours innovation.The preliminary insolvency proceedings of three months have given some breathing space to the company as it seeks to fulfil a flood of orders said Jung.""After a short total halt of activities (at the start of September) now we really have to put our foot on the accelerator like in a Formula 1 race"" said Jung.The company wants to continue investing at its site in Duesseldorf where more than 220 workers are employed.Hakle has already stopped using gas replacing it with petrol in its paper production processes. For the electricity used to transform it into rolls the eventual aim is to cover half of its needs with solar power.",,,

Frankford Candy has teamed up with Kraft Heinz to introduce new Gummy Lunchables in two varieties: Gummy Lunchable Cracker Stackers and Gummy Lunchables Pepperoni Pizza Kit. Both are available now at Five Below stores nationwide as well as Amazon.com and FrankfordCandy.com. The brand has previously launched gummy versions of Oscar Mayer Hot Dogs and Kraft Mac and Cheese as well.

""Consumers are increasingly interested in experiences with favorite food brands that they can share with family and friends and gummy candy is on fire right now"" said Molly Jacobson director of business development at Frankford Candy. ""Lunchables is an iconic brand that was the first to allow people to build and eat a meal their own way. We're excited to give consumers a new way to experience the brand.

During the pandemic consumers learned how to manipulate food flavors and textures to meet their preferences and there’s no going back. Now condiment formulators are exploring all types of mashups including unique carriers global fusions and varied consistencies all intended to wow consumers.

“People want more and bolder flavors and condiments are great delivery vehicles for new experiences” said Ryan Kukuruzovic corporate chef Wixon Saint Francis Wis.

That’s what the Kraft Heinz Co. Chicago offers in its new Heinz 57 Collection. The line of oil-based sauces comes in chili pepper mandarin orange miso and roasted garlic varieties. The collection also includes two infused honeys: black truffle and hot chili.

“As an iconic brand Heinz aims to accelerate culinary trends and create pathways for everyday consumers to discover vast culinary cultures” said Ashleigh Gibson head of marketing and strategy. “With the increase in chef-inspired cooking the Heinz 57 Collection enhances culinary creations and transforms traditional dishes into dynamic creations.”

Billy Roberts senior analyst of food and drink Mintel Chicago and author of “US Condiments Market Report 2022” said he believes it is paramount brands especially long-established ones get creative with modern flavors and textures. Mintel research showed consumers under 45 years old tend to have fewer than six condiments in their refrigerator while those over 45 have more than six.

“Dips and sauces provide a blank canvas for creating myriad flavors and ingredients that the consumer can use to turn simple into sensational without loads of culinary skill” said Holly Adrian senior marketing manager Sensient Natural Ingredients Turlock Calif.

Erika James senior applications technologist – savory Sensient Hoffman Estates Ill. added “Sauces are an easy way to try unexplored cuisines with low risk. Consumers do not have to buy a lot of new ingredients to explore new and unique flavors.”

Trends in form and flavor

Mintel research from May 2021 showed 70% of US sauce/dip buyers use the condiment for dipping. More than half prefer creamy and savory products. Spicy is favored by 47% followed by smoky and sweet. Forty-four percent like sauces/dips with internationally inspired flavors.

“Consumers have become burnt out on home cooking over the past two years and are increasingly exploring global flavors and ways to spice up their go-to dishes while still maintaining convenience and ease in the kitchen which dips sauces and condiments can provide” said Christopher Koetke corporate executive chef Ajinomoto Health and Nutrition North America Inc. Itasca Ill.

Authenticity is the name of the game with internationally inspired condiments said Daniel Espinoza corporate research and development chef OFI Chicago. He said he believes it’s important to explain why certain specific flavorful ingredients are used in recipes.

“Respecting and protecting ingredient provenance is important” Mr. Espinoza said. “We work with growers and supply chain partners around the globe which provides opportunities for innovation and customization from plant to plate. Our single estate black pepper is a great example of the value this adds.”

With this seasoning range producers may trace their pepper ingredient back to its exact plant block of origin. Tracing makes it possible to select specific pepper varieties and ensure consistent quality from batch to batch.

“Looking beyond South America region-specific flavors from Asia and the Caribbean are also having their moment” Mr. Espinoza said. “Korean barbecue marinades featuring sesame oil crushed red pepper ginger garlic and black pepper have been popular during this year’s cook-out season. And Jamaican Jerk seasoned chicken wings are starting to appear on restaurant menus.”

Mr. Espinoza expects to see more rich earthy flavors such as garlic mushrooms truffle cinnamon and roasted nuts over the next several months. He also expects cross-cultural flavor combinations to dominate the savory food market.

“Take classic Asian and Mexican flavors” Mr. Espinoza said. “In both food traditions spices like cloves nutmeg ginger chili black pepper cinnamon star anise and cumin are everywhere making a mashup between the two cuisines both logical and exciting.”

Jen Lyons marketing manager Sensient Flavors & Extracts Hoffman Estates added “We will continue to see fusions of different ethnic cuisines like Mexican-Korean and Thai-Italian.”

Flavored mayonnaise and aioli have taken off the past few years as have dairy-based condiments. At the same time plant-based and vegan varieties of the products started being introduced.

“It’s a way to incorporate new flavors in a simple way” Mr. Kukuruzovic said. “We’ve been tasked with a variety of global flavor developments within this space and we’re certainly not anticipating a slowdown as consumers desire more eclectic flavor combinations and experiences.”

United Natural Foods Inc. Providence RI is introducing specialty organic aiolis and burger spreads under its Woodstock brand. The sriracha aioli features a creamy garlic base with sriracha flavor while citrus meets savory in the lemon dill aioli. The burger sauce is a tangy alternative to ketchup.

Kim Cornelius senior food scientist at Wixon said “Dairy dip projects I have been involved with include crossover flavors from trendy items such as Nashville hot chicken pepperoni pizza cheesy quesadilla and fried pickle. Other interesting concepts include hot honey spicy giardiniera elote and shawarma.”

As consumer demand for plant-based dairy alternatives grows the industry is responding with technology aimed at naturally replicating the richness of dairy without the use of dairy products or edible oils. Recently T. Hasegawa USA Cerritos Calif. introduced a plant-based milk colloid emulsion to the North American market.

“This advanced fat mimetic technology simulates the creaminess and rich mouthfeel of traditional whole milk or cream in a wide range of products including condiments” said Doug Resh director commercial marketing.

In addition to texture issues plant-based condiments may have off notes that include astringent beany and bitter. To assist Ajinomoto soon will introduce Plant Answer M an ingredient system for plant-based mayonnaise and creamy dressings.

“The comprehensive solution includes realistic egg yolk flavor umami kokumi thickening and emulsifying ingredients” Mr. Koetke said. “It can also be used to make vegan honey mustard vegan ranch and vegan sour cream and onion dip.”

Plant-based condiments may add flavor to plant-based main courses. Sensient research showed two-thirds of US consumers would consume more plant-based products if there was a greater variety of flavors.

Spicy with less heat

Dips and sauces are a good way to experiment with spicy flavors according to 46% of consumers surveyed by Mintel with 23% of consumers stating their tolerance for spicy foods has risen in the past year.

“Hot and spicy is still trending but brands are now offering more mild options to appeal to consumers who don’t want extreme heat” said Rachael Jarzembowski marketing manager at Wixon. “Chilies can offer more than just heat. They can offer layers of flavor and add complexity resulting in a more dynamic flavor experience.”

Ms. Adrian said “The demand is for milder chili varietals like ancho and guajillo which offer more complex layering of flavors. They are bold and spicy but with subtle berry or raisin notes and earthy undertones.”

Authenticity and provenance play into sourcing chili peppers. The chili peppers OFI sources from Oaxaca Mexico for example are said to capture the authentic flavors of regional Mexican dishes like Oaxaca mole Yucatan marinade and carne asada.

The flavor dynamic of hot and spicy now has much more regional influence” Mr. Kukuruzovic said.

Chilies vary in capsicum levels which determines the amount of heat and flavor profiles. When they are harvested and how they are processed also influences sensory attributes.

“Salsa roja a classic spicy Mexican sauce is a good example” Mr. Espinoza said. “It’s made with jitomates (red tomatoes) onion garlic and of course chilies. The preparation method should dictate the chosen chili variety.”

The sauce may be prepared three ways. Cocida is when the ingredients are stewed and ground into a smooth sauce. Asada swaps stewing for roasting. Cruda is raw with the ingredients simply chopped and ground without cooking.

“A dried casabel chili is perfect for salsa roja cocida where a long cooking time will help draw out its smoky nutty flavor” Mr. Espinoza said. “More acidic varieties like de arbol or guajillo chilies are for salsa cruda.”

Mr. Resh added “The rise of sriracha opened the door for other international sauces focused on high-heat flavors especially those from Asian countries with Korea leading the way. Gochujang for example is a thick fermented red pepper paste that has a sweet and spicy kick. Future flavors with directional growth from Korea include ganjang jeotgal and makgeolli which could lead to exciting new possibilities in dips dressings and marinades.”

Taste preferences

Umami and kokumi which some refer to as the fifth and sixth basic tastes joining bitter salty sour and sweet are becoming mainstays in condiments as consumer preferences shift in efforts to reduce sodium and sugar intake. More condiments are using monosodium glutamate and other sources of umami and kokumi such as fish sauce miso truffles and even Parmesan cheese.

T. Hasegawa recently introduced Boostract a system for adding or enhancing kokumi in foods. The system allows for a reduction in the characterizing umami ingredient and that translates into a cost savings. When used in an alfredo sauce for example a 20% reduction in Parmesan cheese is possible.

Jennifer Zhou senior director of product marketing – North America ADM Chicago said “Our research finds that 8 out of 10 consumers are intentionally avoiding or reducing sugar in their diets and of those consumers 75% are taking action to limit sugars in sauces and dressings. As a result many sauces and dressings have shifted away from having a sweet flavor profile in favor of more spicy and savory tastes.”

ADM offers a honey extender to enhance the flavor of honey while reducing sugar content. Honey has the added benefit of being a close-to-nature ingredient that consumers recognize.

“We’re seeing a growing preference for fresh and green vegetable flavors whether that’s an herby green goddess-type dressing on pasta salad spicy salsa verde enchiladas or fries dipped in a cucumber and finger lime aioli” Ms. Zhou said. “Tropical flavors are also gaining traction bringing an island feel to sauces infused with passionfruit grilled pineapple and coconut or a cilantro and yuzu vinaigrette dressing.”

Fermented and sour flavors with a regional focus are gaining traction said Ms. Zhou. Examples include condiments such as Korean kimchi Japanese pickled ginger Persian black limes and Italian preserved lemons.

“An up-and-coming flavor is flamed orange inspired by Patagonian open-flame cooking style” Ms. Zhou said. “Fire caramelizes the orange’s internal juices and sugars to create a complex smoky sweetness. The juice and pulp can make a distinct chimichurri sauce or a flavorful simple syrup.”

Botanicals too are catching on. Vegetable and floral combinations provide a fresh take on flavors such as a sauce of vibrant chartreuse-colored peppers with basil and elderflower or a better-for-you dressing with an avocado and yogurt base layered with mint and dill Ms. Zhou said."

I got chocolate-chip cookies from Kroger Safeway Walmart and Costco to review. Alana Al-Hatlani

As a professional baker I've probably made thousands of chocolate-chip cookies from scratch.

Chocolate-chip cookies were also one of the first things I learned to make as a kid and I've since spent a lot of time refining my own recipes for different versions of the classic from soft and chewy to crispy and lacy.

So of course I have strong opinions on what makes a good chocolate-chip cookie.

I don't like them overly sweet which typically happens when there's not enough bitter-but-balancing chocolate folded into the dough. Soft centers and crispy edges are ideal but there are certainly a lot of differing viewpoints on cookie texture.

Although I usually make big batches of my own dough to store in the freezer for a rainy day I also understand that when a craving hits you want a store-bought option that will satisfy.

So I tried chocolate-chip cookies from the bakery section at four national chains near me in Seattle — Costco Kroger Safeway and Walmart.

Going forward L3Harris will be the prime contractor for the KC-390 in the United States and plans to develop US-specific mission systems for the tanker including a brand-new boom purpose-built for US aircraft said Luke Savoie president of L3Harris’s ISR sector.

“Sometimes innovation is about finding the low risk things that meet future demands” he said. “And in this particular instance we really saw a significant question mark around ‘Hey how do we you know move our fighter forces around and then how do we reduce choke points … and how do we become unpredictable for an adversary?’ … Finding a partner like Embraer the answer created itself.”

The announcement of a partnership between L3Harris and Embraer comes just months before the Air Force is slated to decide whether to press forward with a competition for a “bridge tanker” also known as KC-Y that will fill a gap between production of Boeing’s KC-46 and a next-generation family of tankers known as KC-Z.

L3Harris envisions the KC-390 as “complementary” to the large tankers that the Air Force is seeking as part of the bridge tanker program and the company does not expect to offer KC-390 as a potential KC-Y contender. Where it does see opportunity is the KC-Z family of systems as the service considers starting an analysis of alternatives for that program as early as 2024.

“We see strategic [tankers] as a cornerstone or as one of those pillars of a [KC-Z] family of systems. … But we also see the tactical systems [like the KC-390] which have a different offload requirement [and] the ability to be austere or be in alignment with where their supported assets can be” Savoie said. “We’re really focused on that. We believe that tactical component to that family of systems is the logical first component.”

Chinese Consideration

As the US Air Force eyes China as its most powerful potential adversary the service is exploring a concept it calls “agile combat employment” which calls for distributing its aircraft and other infrastructures in smaller disaggregated groups thus making it more difficult for China to wipe out a large portion of US air forces if it were to attack a major base in the Asia-Pacific.

As L3Harris assessed what the Air Force might need in terms of conducting logistics in an austere contested environment fuel emerged as the most critical commodity necessary for keeping air operations going Savoie said. However even smallest tanker in the Air Force’s current inventory the KC-135 is a relatively large aircraft which may make it difficult for supporting distributed operations at a more tactical level.

“That really led us to a very logical conclusion which was a partnership with Embraer” said Savoie. The KC-390 is “the first clean-sheet designed tanker since the 1950s. It’s purpose-built [to be a tanker] not a commercial-derivative [airplane] made into something else. … And it was also an austere platform a platform that can land in the dirt a platform that can land in various types of runways [capable of] short-field [takeoffs and landings] very easy to service.”

Embraer is currently producing a total of 22 KC-390s for the Brazilian air force with Portugal the Netherlands and Hungary also signed on to buy the aircraft. For the US-version L3Harris will design and integrate both the refueling boom and other US-specific mission systems as well as create a “digital twin” of those mission systems using digital engineering Savoie said.

While L3Harris and Embraer have not finalized how much of the KC-390 will be made in America Savoie said that “at a minimum” the company will conduct the final assembly in the United States with the US-specific mission systems added at L3Harris’s facilities in Waco Texas.

Savoie declined to detail how much L3Harris and Embraer are investing to develop the US-specific version of the KC-390 as well as what testing milestones are planned. He also would not comment on how the boom operator station will be configured including whether boom operators would use cameras and sensors to visualize the refueling process or whether any portion of the mission could be automated.

“We have multiple options of what we plan to do [with the boom] both remote and local in the platform … with multiple options for how the boom operator interacts with the boom and interacts with the refueler” he said.

The partnership between L3Harris and Embraer is the death knell of a series of Boeing-Embraer partnership agreements to market the KC-390 globally. The companies in December 2018 announced a joint venture to “promote and develop new markets” for the KC-390. However after Boeing terminated a $4.2 billion deal for a majority stake in Embraer’s commercial aviation business in 2020 it became unclear whether the two aerospace companies would remain partnered on KC-390.

Jackson Schneider CEO of Embraer Defense and Security told reporters in June that the company was closing in on an agreement for a new industry partner for the KC-390 reported Aviacionline a Spanish-language aerospace trade publication.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS9lbWJyYWVyLWFuZC1sMy1oYXJyaXMtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1uZXctYWdpbGUtdGFua2VyLXZpYS1rYy0zOTAtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1haXItZm9yY2Utb3BlcmF0aW9uYWwtaW1wZXJhdGl2ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Embraer and L3 Harris to Develop New Agile Tanker via KC-390 to Support Air Force Operational Imperatives,"Arlington Va. September 19 2022 — Embraer S.A. (NYSE: ERJ; B3: EMBR3) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) today announced a partnership to develop an “Agile Tanker” a tactical aerial refueling option to address the U.S. Air Force’s operational imperatives and joint force refueling requirements especially for contested logistics environments.

The companies signed an agreement to expand the capabilities of Embraer’s KC-390 Millennium tactical tanker aircraft. Enhancements include the addition of advanced boom operations and mission systems to support agile basing and sustainment for operations in contested areas and resilient communications supporting JADC2 requirements.

“U.S. Air Force strategic planners have stated agile combat employment will require refueling platforms optimized to support a disaggregated approach to air dominance in contested logistics environments” said Christopher E. Kubasik Chair and Chief Executive Officer L3Harris. “Collaborating with Embraer to develop and integrate new capabilities to the multi-mission KC-390 provides a cost-effective fast-to-field solution that embodies our trusted disruptor approach.”

Aircraft enhancements will complement the tanker’s existing capabilities which already include the ability to refuel aircraft with a variable speed drogue receive fuel and to take off and land from short and improvised runways allowing for greater mission area coverage.

“We continue seeking meaningful and strategic partnerships that generate new developments and expand the KC-390 Millennium’s market reach” said Francisco Gomes Neto President and CEO of Embraer. “Our aircraft is capturing the attention of Air Forces around the world and we’re thrilled by this opportunity to combine Embraer’s state-of-the-art platform and systems with L3Harris’ mission-driven solutions to deliver on the U.S. Air Force’s operational imperatives.”

The Air Force operational imperatives are a roadmap for successfully bringing about the new technologies thinking and cultures the Air and Space Forces must have to deter and if necessary defeat modern day adversaries.

The speedy versatile customizable KC-390 Millennium can support a range of missions and possesses a high-reliability rate. By combining L3Harris’ experience as an aircraft missionization prime with Embraer’s state-of-the-art jet-powered KC-390 Millennium platform both companies are ready to provide the next generation of tanker solutions for the Department of Defense and the US Air Force.

To support the Buy American Act requirements the parties are studying the Agile Tanker program production with final assembly in the U.S. followed by aircraft modernization and missionization at the L3Harris’ Waco Texas aircraft modification center.

Ask autonomous vehicle experts this question and the answer invariably includes a discussion of geofencing.

In the broadest sense geofencing is simply a virtual boundary around a physical area. In the world of self-driving cars it describes a crucial subset of the operational design domain — the geographic region where the vehicle is functional. Reaching full Level 5 autonomy means removing the “fence” from geofenced autonomous cars. Experts say that will require artificial intelligence that can make abstractions inferences and become smarter as it is being used.

L5 cars do not yet exist and they will require a major leap in technology compared with today’s high-tech vehicles. Currently the most advanced self-driving cars operate at Level 4 autonomy including the robo-taxis in San Francisco Phoenix Shenzhen and other cities. Those vehicles have a limited operational domain and can only be fully autonomous under certain conditions such as when the car is located within the boundaries of its geofence. By SAE definition L5 vehicles are capable of “operating the vehicle on-road anywhere that a typically skilled human driver can reasonably operate a conventional vehicle.” An L5 vehicle that has a geofence for a business reason— for example because the manufacturer has the authority to sell autonomous cars in one country but not another nation nearby— is still an L5 vehicle under the definition.

Differentiating between a L4 and L5 vehicle is straightforward. However turning the former vehicle into the latter is a complex technological challenge. “The limits provided by geofencing have a profound effect on the capabilities that an autonomous vehicle requires which impacts the hardware required to power the autonomous systems” said Robert Day director of automotive partnerships for Arm’s Automotive and IoT Line of Business. “Limiting the area to more ‘private’ locations or even sidewalks versus roads can significantly reduce the type of interactions the vehicle will have with other objects such as cars trucks cyclists and pedestrians.”

Day said a good example of this on a smaller scale is the Kiwibot delivery vehicle which is designed to make deliveries via sidewalks. “By reducing the speed and geographic area the bots require fewer sensor systems to identify obstacles than the more complex road-borne vehicles and hence require less computing power to process the sensor data and make the appropriate decisions.”

At the other end of the spectrum are robo-taxis which require highly complex systems even when geofenced. “The sensor suite becomes very elaborate with multiple sensor modalities such as radar lidar and high-definition cameras placed around the vehicle” Day noted. “Processing huge amounts of sensor data requires a very high-performance heterogenous processing system more akin to a data center. Also being able to make driving decisions and actions in real-time requires very complex software algorithms.”

Those very complex algorithms and their associated hardware are critical to an L5 vehicle breaking through the geofence. “An L5 must essentially be able to not only sense its environment but derive meaning and make inferences about that environment when it approaches something with which it is unfamiliar” said David Fritz vice president of hybrid-physical and virtual systems for automotive and mil/aero at Siemens Digital Industries Software. “In other words it will need to be able to learn on the job because there is no way to train an AI to handle every possible situation the vehicle might experience.”

To this point Fritz described an event several years ago in which an autonomous system undergoing testing “saw” something it had never before encountered — a multi-level parking garage. “The vehicle thought the cars parked in the parking garage were blocking the road. It thought ‘Car stopped go around the curb.’ In a geofenced area you drive the car around and collect the data so the vehicle can say ‘If the car is 10 feet off the ground ignore it. It’s not going to hurt you.’ When a system encounters something and doesn’t know what to do about it in many cases the car simply stops moving.”

AI algorithms today are literal. “Once you have a literal interpretation of something it’s hard to back out and abstract” Fritz said. “There are lots of examples in Australia where the AI was trained for dogs cats cows and deer and when the car saw a kangaroo it didn’t know what to do and the car just drove over it. A human would never do that. Even if the human has never seen a kangaroo before we would know it was an animal.”

Developing AI that can make those sorts of inferences requires it to think more like a human would under the same circumstances. “Right now when we’re recognizing objects we’re recognizing them essentially by their outline and then projecting a three-dimensional rotation” Fritz continued. “We say ‘An animal is something that moves. This doesn’t appear to be blown by the wind it’s moving under its own locomotion. It’s an animal and animals deserve certain respect.’ That’s what will need to go into the algorithm and we’re not doing that yet. Humans do this without even thinking from the time that we’re born.”

Research is underway and there are AI projects trying to figure out exactly how to process this sort of activity. “The basics are understood but the level of complexity needed for L5 is not” he said. “Inferencing is using the network to make decisions based on the inputs but the machine learning for a car is the actual teaching process that is a lot more onerous Right now we use supercomputers to do that or a whole bunch of PCs on a PC farm to help crunch the numbers. The result of all that processing and training then goes into the neural network implementation that does the inputs. We have a good handle on inferencing and doing that cost effectively and doing it for low power. It’s the machine learning part where all of a sudden it increases by a couple orders of magnitude. If we need in-car learning we need to solve the teaching-learning process to the same level we’ve done for inferencing. And that’s a ways away.”

When AI does advance in that way there will be a number of ethical decisions at play. If a car is going to think like a human which human should it think like? Should the decisions the car makes mirror the values of the human who owns it?

“There are laws in certain countries that resolve some of the philosophical issues but of course it’s not exhaustive” said Fritz. “The law may say it’s okay to run over the kangaroo but that might not be the decision of the driver.” He imagines a scenario in which a newly-purchased autonomous car puts its owner through a number of simulations to learn from the owner’s preferences regarding say re-routing a car around a squirrel.

Fritz predicts the industry is several decades away from that type of technology. In-car learning likely will take place within the vehicle and not the cloud because of latency and connection issues. “Quantum computing would be a huge step forward and being able to do so in a cost-effective manner will be necessary for the automotive industry to create ‘simulated neurons’ and AI trained with massive data sets. Until that happens I don’t think we’ll ever say that a car can drive anywhere it hasn’t been and get there better than a human could.”

Even after the industry achieves L5 and addresses the thorny ethical issues that come with a hyper-advanced AI auto OEMs and other parties may still make use of geofencing.

Paul Graykowski senior technical marketing manager at Arteris IP describes geofencing as a sort of “training wheels” for more advanced autonomous technology and to some extent for the drivers themselves.

Just like training wheels protect a rider from some amount of danger Graykowski imagines a world in which a L5 car uses geofences to prevent the human from routing the car through construction flooded streets or icy roads. “That type of geofence will require not only plenty of compute power in the car or in the cloud via a strong network connection but smart city infrastructure communicating with the vehicle.”

Additionally governments could require auto OEMs to geofence L5 cars so the vehicles only drive through designated areas Graykowski said particularly as communities grapple with what it means to have both autonomous and non-autonomous cars on the road together.

“Geofencing will probably exist in some capacity for the foreseeable future” Graykowski said.

Conclusion

Fully autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere the driver directs it to without the need to put their hands on the steering wheel are still a ways off. But the number of corner cases goes down significantly in highly controlled environments such as a geofenced lane on a highway or on a limited access road. It’s there that L5 will prove its value and as more cars and roadways are enabled this could have a significant impact on how we view autonomous technology.

But to be sure this is still all in the future and it will take time to work out all the possible bugs.

By Gambling Insider

Gaming as an industry is continuing to grow and despite macro-economic headwinds companies continue to perform well.

But as we emerge from a pandemic and if economists’ projections are to be believed ride headfirst into a recession which companies are currently on top and for how long will it stay that way?

To this end we have broken down the top 10 gambling companies by market cap; offering a quick overview of their current financial situation and outlook.

10. Française des Jeux (FDJ) - €5.97bn (US$5.97bn)

Perhaps to many people’s surprise French national lottery operator FDJ has eked out a spot on this list. Like many land-based businesses Covid-19 took a heavy toll on FDJ but it has since executed a rebound. However while its revenue has recovered shareholders’ confidence has not. On a year-to-date basis FDJ’s stock price has fallen dropping from almost €39 to less than €32.

Currency fluctuations have naturally impacted the company’s market cap especially given the current euro to dollar exchange rate but a long-term pattern of diminished confidence indicates a more intrinsic problem: people do not see FDJ as a worthwhile investment. The company has struggled to regain shareholders’ trust after being hit by several headwinds in mid-2021 including an EU probe and Goldman Sachs downgrading its rating from “neutral” to “sell.”

However market conditions are generally unfavourable right now and to earn a spot on this list is an indication that FDJ is doing something right. Ultimately the company continues to support good causes its primary goal as France’s national lottery operator.

Wynn Resorts’ story is a tale of two cities: Las Vegas and Macau. While the former has undergone a tremendous recovery from Covid-19 the latter continues to limp from one problem to another

9. Wynn Resorts - US$7.44bn

Wynn Resorts’ story is a tale of two cities: Las Vegas and Macau. While the former has undergone a tremendous recovery from Covid-19 the latter continues to limp from one problem to another. Most pundits don’t foresee a recovery for Macau until at least next year and that’s if further complications do not arise.

Until this occurs Wynn Resorts will have to hope shareholders can stick it out relying on the company’s confidence in an eventual turnaround. But despite CEO Craig Billings’ optimism his words may fall on increasingly deaf ears. Wynn Resorts’ stock price has ebbed and flowed in 2022. At the time of writing it sits at US$64.02; a mild uptick when compared to last month.

However this constitutes a considerable downturn when compared to the over US$80 its stock price opened at this year. But many analysts seem to share Billings’ optimism albeit more cautiously. This may change if fears of a recession become a reality but for now the company’s position is relatively secure.

8. Entain – £7.2bn (US$8.2bn)

Entain is our first predominantly online operator and one that has grown considerably in the past few years. But Entain’s stock is currently valued at just over £12 having fallen from nearly £17 at the start of 2022.

This is likely the result of a post-pandemic market stabilisation. As land-based operators return Entain’s online business has consequently suffered. Don’t take our word for it; Entain has commented on this phenomenon itself. The company’s Q2 results reflected what it called “tough 2021 comparators.”

A withdrawal from the Netherlands has also impacted Entain’s performance as well as tighter affordability measures in the UK. But improved retail trading has helped the company continue to grow and outperform analysts’ expectations.

Currently most pundits predict a healthy growth trajectory for Entain and one it seems determined to meet despite what CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen called an “uncertain” macro-economic outlook.

DraftKings is still very much a new kid on the block but its youthful energy has helped the company carve out a commanding position in the US sports betting market. However DraftKings might benefit from the age-old proverb: slow and steady wins the race

7. DraftKings - US$8.34bn

DraftKings is still very much a new kid on the block but its youthful energy has helped the company carve out a commanding position in the US sports betting market. However DraftKings might benefit from the age-old proverb: slow and steady wins the race.

In its quest to conquer the United States DraftKings has spent a fortune on marketing and promotional offers. While the company has recorded double-digit top-line growth DraftKings’ bottom line has born the brunt of its expenditure.

Q2 saw the company generate US$466m in revenue but after deducting all costs DraftKings reported a net loss of US$217m. Nevertheless shareholder confidence has not wavered. Following the publication of DraftKings’ second quarter results its share price actually rose.

Whether investors will continue to support the company’s strategy especially as a recession looms is perhaps less likely – but for now DraftKings seems content to spend spend spend.

6. Caesars Entertainment – US$9.67bn

Caesars like many land-based operators saw a surge in visitors after Covid restrictions were lifted. But while its revenue has rebounded investors’ confidence has unfortunately not. Caesars’ Q2 results triggered a short-lived stock bump but on a year-to-date basis the company’s share price has fallen from over US$89 to less than US$45.

However this may be a mild hiccup given Caesars’ recent financial results and broader ambitions. Many analysts believe now is the time to buy Caesars’ stock which may be sound advice if the company’s historic performance is anything to go by. Newer ventures will also offer additional revenue sources such as Caesars’ foray into online sports betting.

Like many land-based operators Caesars is attempting to capitalise on iGaming though when it comes to wagering has proven less successful than MGM Resorts. However the company’s bread and butter is and for the foreseeable future will be its brick-and-mortar casinos.

5. MGM Resorts – US$13.11bn

MGM Resorts is a predominantly land-based operator with both Las Vegas and Macau operations like Wynn Resorts. However the similarities end there.

MGM Resorts’ operations in Las Vegas have helped offset a decrease in Macau revenue resulting in an overall year-on-year increase of US$1bn for Q2. Where Wynn Resorts was hampered by Macau MGM has managed to mitigate the effects.

As a result the company’s slow climb back from Covid-19 has continued. In March 2020 amid widespread lockdowns and closures MGM Resorts’ share price plummeted to less than US$10. However at the time of writing it is now worth more than US$33.

4. Aristocrat – AU$22.77bn (US$15.2bn)

Our next entry on this list is an Australian company and the first supplier. Aristocrat has narrowly missed out on a medal posting fourth overall in terms of market cap. However the runner up will likely feel little dismay given its considerable growth over the past five years.

As a manufacturer of gambling machines Aristocrat was understandably hit hard by Covid-19 but like so many other companies has executed a comeback. While Aristocrat’s share price has dropped since reaching a high of more than AU$48 late last year it has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels.

3. Evolution Gaming – SEK 179.73bn (US$16.6bn)

We have now reached the final three. Evolution has earned itself a bronze medal but the Swedish supplier’s lead over Aristocrat is fairly narrow.

Evolution’s evolution corresponds to the growth of online gaming more broadly and in particular live casino. Whether it can sustain this growth as land-based gaming returns remains to be seen but the company continues to post impressive quarterly results.

Nevertheless Evolution’s stock is fairly unstable. On a long-term basis the supplier’s share price has risen considerably but since peaking last year has been on a downward trajectory.

This trend looks set to continue but it will at some point have to stabilise. However when this will occur is hard to say and the current macro-economic outlook does not favour a plateau anytime soon.

2. Flutter Entertainment - £18.38bn (US$20.9bn)

Representing Ireland in the silver medal position is Flutter Entertainment. The bookmaker maintains a commanding position in both the UK and US betting markets latterly through its FanDuel brand so it comes as no surprise to see Flutter sitting pretty in second place.

At the time of writing the company’s share price stands at nearly £104 and has in recent months reported sustained healthy growth. Flutter also completed the acquisition of Sisal last month extending its dominance to Italy.

Consequently the company is primed for future growth with most analysts recommending investors “buy.”

1. Las Vegas Sands – US$29.53bn

Finally we come to first place. While online gaming has grown in recent years and despite Macau’s troubles Las Vegas Sands (LVS) remains number one in terms of market cap – but will the king keep his crown for much longer?

LVS stock has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Currently the company’s share price is just over US$38 a considerable decrease when compared to the almost $70 it was worth in February 2020. While LVS experienced a slight rebound in March of last year the company’s share price has by and large been on a downward trajectory ever since.

Ultimately the company’s fortunes are tied to those of Macau and consequently the city’s recovery from Covid-19. But even though LVS remains confident that visitor levels will return to pre-pandemic norms it may well be a while yet before Macau truly emerges from the pandemic.

A more pressing issue is whether investors share the company’s confidence and whether they have the means or willpower to wait out this storm – especially as another is brewing on the horizon.

Conclusion

All-in-all there are a few surprising faces here but mostly they’re who you would expect. There is a nice balance of online and land-based but whether this balance will be maintained in a years’ time is hard to say. There is a lot riding on Macau’s recovery especially for Wynn Resorts and LVS as well as MGM Resorts to a lesser extent. If the city takes too long to recover Wynn Resorts and LVS may find themselves moving down a place or two.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L25ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktY2FzaW5vcy1hcmUtY29taW5nLXdoYXQtZG9lcy10aGF0LW1lYW4tZm9yLXdpbmQtY3JlZWstYmV0aGxlaGVtL9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L25ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktY2FzaW5vcy1hcmUtY29taW5nLXdoYXQtZG9lcy10aGF0LW1lYW4tZm9yLXdpbmQtY3JlZWstYmV0aGxlaGVtLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York City casinos are coming.

L3Harris Leidos Northrop Grumman Raytheon and SAIC were all selected to be part of the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) Digital Infrastructure Consortium an Air Force spokesperson confirmed.

This consortium will help the Air Force build out the technical and business roadmap to deploy the digital infrastructure on accelerated timelines and includes network engineering systems engineering and architecture development the spokesperson added.

ABMS is the Air Force’s contribution to the Pentagon’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept which seeks to connect sensors and shooters and provide battlefield commanders with the right information to make faster — and better — decisions.

In a statement L3Harris said this architecture will define requirements and standards to inform the development of ABMS while it will address the secure processing resilient communications data management and open-architecture design criteria for its foundation.

“To embolden commanders with information and decision advantage they need interoperability which is a priority outcome for the collaborative consortium” said Ross Niebergall L3Harris vice president and chief technical officer.

SAIC in a statement said it will collaborate with other members as part of the consortium to integrate modern capabilities using digital engineering which will become the foundation for the Air Force’s contribution to the JADC2 concept.

Officials have been previewing this digital infrastructure for some time.

Last week at DefenseTalks hosted by DefenseScoop Winston Beauchamp deputy chief information officer explained the Air Force is developing a model-based approach to allow the service to perform repeatable experimentation against proposed solutions defining measures of effectiveness and measures of performance that would allow objective evaluation.

This model was in part developed from a need to essentially reimagine what battle management should be to create the underbelly for technical solutions that use advanced algorithms.

“If we do not understand the process of which to make a decision there is no technology that you’re going to develop that’s going to suddenly turn this tide” Brig. Gen. Jeff Valenzia JADC2 cross-functional team lead for Air Force Futures told DefensScoop in an August interview.

The team devised a systems engineering approach to look at what command and control should look like going forward.

In addition to releasing the model to industry officials have said they also will be taking it to Indo-Pacific Command and integrating it with other international partners.

“We have to prove it still” Valenzia said. “Our hypothesis is that what this model has become is the seed to create what we think will be the first instantiation of joint C2 … This is why we are partnered with the Navy initially because the Indo-Pacom was our pacing theater” where Pentagon officials see China as the United States’ top military rival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jNGlzcm5ldC5jb20vYmF0dGxlZmllbGQtdGVjaC9pdC1uZXR3b3Jrcy8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L3VzLWFpci1mb3JjZS1waWNrcy01LWNvbXBhbmllcy10by10YWtlLW9uLWJhdHRsZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWNoYWxsZW5nZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Air Force picks 5 companies to take on battle management challenges,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force said it selected five companies to help accelerate the development of its Advanced Battle Management System as the service’s secretary Frank Kendall acknowledged that efforts to modernize command and control systems have proved more challenging than expected.

L3Harris Technologies Leidos Northrop Grumman Raytheon Technologies and Science Applications International Corporation or SAIC were picked for the venture dubbed the ABMS Digital Infrastructure Consortium according to announcements on Sept. 19.

Together they will work on secure processing resilient communications open-ended designs and other digital challenges inherent to the Air Force’s next-generation command and control methods according to L3Harris. Northrop Grumman similarly said the bloc would construct “technical and business roadmaps” to speed up schedules.

“We’ll apply our deep technical expertise in systems engineering data management connectivity and secure processing through integration into a digital engineering environment to shape the foundation for how data is harnessed by the Department of the Air Force DOD and its allies and partners” Paul Meyer president of Department 22 at Raytheon Intelligence and Space said in a separate statement. “Our objective is to strengthen our customer’s readiness to deter and defend against pacing threats by helping military commanders make synchronized and more informed decisions faster than ever before in multiple domains.”

The companies are all among the 40 largest global defense firms ranked by revenue according to the latest Defense News tally.

ABMS is the Air Force’s contribution to Joint All-Domain Command and Control the Department of Defense’s vision for how information will be shared across military services and between forces on the battlefield. The multibillion-dollar concept relies on artificial intelligence and a wealth of other advanced tech to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Such interconnectedness officials say is needed to outperform China or Russia.

Kendall said Monday that efforts to reform the service’s communication and battle management have been challenging. He announced the appointment of a new program executive officer Brig. Gen. Luke Cropsey to oversee the project Defense News reported. Cropsey will report to Andrew Hunter and Frank Calvelli assistant secretaries in charge of acquisition for the Air Force and Space Force.

“One of the findings of the operational imperative work to date is we have not appreciated the scale of the effort needed” to modernize the Air Force’s C3 battle management in a JADC2 context he said at the Air Force Association’s Air Space and Cyber Conference in National Harbor Maryland. “Our efforts to date have not been adequately focused nor have they been adequately integrated.”

Kendall also said he and Air Force and Space Force chiefs — Gen. CQ Brown and Gen. Jay Raymond — will review battle management efforts quarterly.

Last week Air Force Deputy CIO Winston Beauchamp said the service would provide to industry an ABMS test model that would improve experimentation and evaluation. The model he said is an outgrowth of work done by an Air Force-Space Force cross-functional team which identified four areas for advancing ABMS including “coming up with a model-based approach.”

Following the first phase of the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program Lockheed Martin was notified by DARPA that we won the contract to develop and demonstrate a nuclear-powered spacecraft. The project will represent a rapid advancement in propulsion technology to benefit exploration and national defense.

DARPA partnered with NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate on the DRACO project as both agencies will benefit from this leading edge technology.

“This is a prime technology that can be used to transport humans and materials to the Moon” said Kirk Shireman vice president of Lunar Exploration Campaigns at Lockheed Martin Space. “A safe reusable nuclear tug spacecraft would revolutionize cislunar operations. With more speed agility and maneuverability nuclear thermal propulsion also has many national security applications for cislunar space.”

In addition to our long history and expertise in nuclear controls Lockheed Martin is excited to partner with BWX Technologies on DRACO to develop the nuclear reactor and produce the special high-assay low-enriched uranium or HALEU fuel. The in-space flight demo of the nuclear thermal rocket engine vehicle is slated to launch no later than 2027.

As the 2020s proceed laser weapons are rapidly evolving from a promising concept to practical battlefield weapons. However this isn't a simple linear progression. Laser weapons are extremely complex systems that are often sent back to square one when some concept in the design proves to be no longer practical.

Each of these subsystems which includes power units laser generators beam combiners focusing units targeting systems and many others must all move forward and properly integrate in a form that is not only functional but robust and reliable enough to be a practical weapon at sea on land in the air and in space.

Obviously the most important subsystem is the solid-state laser itself. In this case Lockheed Martin has boosted the power into the 300-kW class. This is five times the power of the HELIOS tactical laser that the company delivered to the US Navy in August for integration into existing warships.

The new 300-kW laser will be used in several demonstration projects including the US Army's Indirect Fires Protection Capability-High Energy Laser (IFPC-HEL) Demonstrator laser weapon system. Laboratory and field testing is expected later this year.

By upping the power on the laser future weapons will be able to engage a wider variety of larger targets at longer ranges and neutralize them more quickly.

""Lockheed Martin increased the power and efficiency and reduced the weight and volume of continuous-wave high energy lasers which reduces risk for future fielding efforts of high power laser weapon systems"" said Rick Cordaro vice president Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions.

As the Air Force prepares to declare initial operating capability for the HH-60W Jolly Green II the service’s new combat search and rescue helicopter the manufacturer is pushing back against the idea that its helicopter isn’t suited to combat in the Pacific—and against planned cuts to USAF’s purchase.

Sikorsky Aircraft a Lockheed Martin subsidiary has delivered 23 of 65 HH-60Ws on order. The Air Force’s fiscal 2023 budget request would fund 10 more but that would close out the service’s planned purchases well short of the 113 Jolly Green IIs originally planned.

David Morgan a former HH-60G Pave Hawk pilot who is now the Air Force business development manager at Sikorsky said the Jolly Green II while still carrying the HH-60 designator is not just a spiffed up Pave Hawk.

“A lot of people think it’s just more of the same but it is a completely new generation of aircraft” Morgan said. Among the changes: A bigger internal main fuel tank that holds almost 300 more gallons eliminating auxiliary tanks from from inside the cabin; seats for pararescue jumpers that fold up into the ceiling; and “all kinds of sensors and communications” that enable survivors’ signals to go “right to the aircraft digitally.”

Those features will keep it relevant in the Pacific he argued. And without an alternative in hand cutting the purchase now may not make sense.

Congress could still increase the Jolly Green II purchase. Both the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations committees support taking the total to 85 aircraft in the 2023 National Defense Authorization bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup questioned “the strategic underpinning of these and other acquisition decisions” and both the House and Senate Armed Services committees have called for a review.

Military planners say the transition from a focus on counter-insurgency to peer power competition particularly in the Pacific where distances are far greater changes requirements. They question the value of a helicopter to conduct long-range rescues in case of combat with China. Air Combat Command boss Gen. Mark D. Kelly has said he does not see how the Jolly Green II would be able to recover survivors behind enemy lines in Asia.

Reducing the fleet to 75 helicopters “is really going to put a strain on this fleet for the Air Force” Morgan contended. With a fleet of 112 the Pave Hawk “has always been considered a low density high demand aircraft. They’re always over deployed with very little time to reset and train.”

He thinks the Air Force’s worries about survivability in the Pacific could be soothed as the Jolly Green II enters service.

“I think the concern is with the Air Force about survivability and some of the speed and the range in the near-peer fight” Morgan said. “But you know this aircraft does have a refueling probe air refueling so it should have unlimited range. They can preposition the aircraft in support of any anticipated operations.” He suspects it won’t fly “single-aircraft alone unafraid into some of these fights” but instead “go with packages. … They’re going to provide air superiority. They’re going to provide … support for the aircraft. So it’s not going to be the only aircraft on the search and rescue.”

And for now “it’s still being tested and we don’t understand the full capabilities of this aircraft. So I think making assumptions before all that’s figured out could be premature.”

Edward Stanhouse deputy program executive officer for intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and special operations forces has said that in terms of an alternative a team “is looking at a variety of technologies in that exploration mode right now from … [amphibious to] potential applications of some of those unmanned applications. A lot of work a lot of conceptual work I think has to be done in that area to do the proof of concepts.”

So far Sikorsky has trained about 200 pilots and crew members on the Jolly Green II. The HH-60W program director for Sikorsky Steven Hill said he’d recently met and flown with some of the crews “and what you hear is they just love the aircraft” he said. “It just gives them a lot more capability than they’ve ever had before. They’re just excited about getting it into their hands and getting out and getting deployed eventually.”

The U.S. may not have the only military with the Jolly Green II in the long run.

“We’ve had international interest for the last several years” Morgan confirmed. “We’ve had several countries following the development and asking for pricing and availability. We’ve provided that as best we can based on the development stage.

Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores have been neck and neck in popularity for decades and most people have their favorite for various reasons. Even their number of stores in North America is comparable with around 2284 stores for Home Depot and 2370 Lowe's stores according to Business Insider. Although Lowe's has been around three decades longer than Home Depot it still has less than a hundred more stores.

Perhaps the biggest difference between the two big box home improvement brands is that Home Depot seems to be aimed more toward professional contractors while Lowe's tends to be a little more DIY-friendly. Even so a survey by Bank of America discovered that the majority of millennials prefer Home Depot over Lowe's even though the latter usually has larger stores. Regardless of their primary customer base or the square footage of their stores it may just come down to who has the best deal on showers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC9yaWNrLWxvd2UtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXNvY2lhbC1wcmFjdGljZS0yMTc3NTgz0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFydG5ldC5jb20vYXJ0LXdvcmxkL3JpY2stbG93ZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctc29jaWFsLXByYWN0aWNlLTIxNzc1ODMvYW1wLXBhZ2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘That Just Shattered Things for Me’: Rick Lowe on the Moment He Realized His Art Had to Escape the Studio to Have Real-World Impact,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC9yaWNrLWxvd2UtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXNvY2lhbC1wcmFjdGljZS0yMTc3NTgz0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFydG5ldC5jb20vYXJ0LXdvcmxkL3JpY2stbG93ZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctc29jaWFsLXByYWN0aWNlLTIxNzc1ODMvYW1wLXBhZ2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C2530>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

We also share one grill to avoid.

By Paul Hope

Lowe’s offers an appealingly large stock of gas grills. Below we’ve compiled a list of some of the very best gas grills you can buy there—including models from our latest tests in small medium and large sizes—as well as one to avoid.

“Lowe’s offers one of the broadest selections from Broil-King and Char-Broil two brands that are exceptionally popular with CR members” says CR’s market analyst Mark Allwood. “But don’t buy based upon those brand names alone. Not all their models fare well in our tests.”

If you’re unsure which size you need or which features matter start with our grill buying guide. CR members can also jump right into our comprehensive gas grill ratings to compare models.

Best Gas Grills at Lowe's

We test grills from nearly every brand sold at Lowe’s including Char-Broil Dyna-Glo Permasteel and Weber.

But don’t assume that Lowe’s will always offer the best deal on other options. It’s possible that competing retailers might stock the same model at a lower price—and some of the models below may be temporarily out of stock. Therefore it’s always wise to shop across retailers. We also offer expert picks for the best gas grills at Home Depot and the best gas grills at Walmart.

Lowe's Shopping Tips: Grills

Before checking out keep in mind some of these tips from Consumer Reports’ secret shoppers.

Check inventory online before you shop. The grill you want might be at a store near you. If it’s not Lowe’s will ship it free of charge to a store where you can pick it up.

Check the grill’s dimensions. Make sure it will fit in the space that you have in mind. You can check the dimensions on Lowe’s or on the grill’s summary page in our gas grill ratings. Lowe’s offers free assembly of full-sized grills if you buy in the store and says its stores usually have assembled grills on hand.

Check your cargo space. Lowe’s will deliver an assembled grill to your home free of charge if it costs $499 or more. Otherwise you’ll have to pay a delivery fee or you can haul the grill home yourself. (If your car isn’t big enough you can rent a truck at some store locations for $19 for the first 75 minutes.)

Check the box the grill came in. If you ordered your grill online or picked up one that hasn’t been put together make sure all of the parts are included and that nothing is broken or damaged before you start assembling the grill. If something is missing call Lowe’s customer service (800-445-6937). If the wait for a replacement part is too long call the manufacturer directly to see whether you can get it sooner.

Lowest-Scoring Grill at Lowe's

Char-Broil Patio Bistro 15601900

CR’s take: Even though the Char-Broil Patio Bistro 15601900 is budget-friendly it’s a lackluster small grill. This model’s performance is disappointing in key areas such as its temperature range and heating evenness where it receives just Fair marks in CR’s lab tests. And although it preheats quickly and has a side burner—a nice feature to see at this price—these don’t make up for the fact that this grill is a subpar performer overall.

And that change was celebrated Thursday with a grand opening and ribbon-cutting of the school’s new rubber surface on all of the playgrounds thus making all the school campus fully inclusive for the students.

This project began last year with a discussion about the various problems with the mulch which was on the playgrounds noted Monica Donaldson who has served as the project manager and PIT Crew (Parent Involvement Team) PTO co-treasurer at the school located in Mooresville at 483 Rocky River Road.

One such issue she shared centered on access for some of the students who have disabilities. With the mulch they had a raised wall around it to keep it contained and therefore allowing only one way to enter for those needing wheelchairs or the use of braces. Maneuvering on the mulch was difficult especially in the wheelchair Donaldson said.

Thus they began to research the project and found out that rubber surfaces are “safer and more inclusive for everybody involved. Then came the price tag which was expensive” she said but this didn’t stop them. They just figured it would take them several years of fundraising through the school.

Through the efforts of the students and staff half the funds were raised as a result of their Booster-thon event last spring but as the principal Dr. Chuck LaRusso shared “we still weren’t there yet so we reached out to some partners.”

“We were on a mission to find the funds to get it done this year” Donaldson said.

With a team effort of the PIT Crew and Kaylor Kaemba who was at that time interim assistant principal and is now an assistant principal at the high school they shared their vision with others in the community. Secretary Katie Pettigrew wrote up a grant proposal which was submitted to Lowe’s and the school became a recipient of a Lowe’s Home Town grant.

In addition to the help from Lowe’s local construction company Pedulla Excavation came onboard did the excavation work and provided new sidewalks thus allowing easy access to the school’s three playgrounds — which includes the main one the pre-K and the third grade playgrounds. They also placed a new 16x20 pad for children to do sidewalk chalk art.

Jake Rollings store manager for the Troutman Lowe’s along with Adam Bauernschub assistant manager of the store were there for the celebration. Rollings reflected on the occasion by sharing that the Lowe’s Home Town Project is all about home town for Lowe’s.

“Last year we celebrated out 100 year anniversary” he said. “So we started selecting 100 home towns that we would decide to give back every year. It was so successful last year we said we are going to do it again every year now.”

Having grown up in Mooresville literally just around the corner from Rocky River Elementary just off Shearers and Pandora roads Rollings said “it was really cool when they asked me to do it and they didn’t know I grew up right there right around the corner from Rocky River. So it’s a really cool opportunity to support connect with the folks at the school and give back to the community the kids.”

Mickey and Terri Pedulla likewise shared the importance of supporting and giving back to help the schools and the children and donating as much as they can.

Noting that they have 10 grandchildren three of whom are at the school Mickey said that “everybody’s got to help everybody to make it work. And that’s basically what it’s all about helping everybody.”

Once the finances were secured the actual work of pouring the rubber surfaces which was done by a Denver company took about 2-1/2 weeks Donaldson said thus providing a safe inclusive place for all of the little Rocky Racers.

While not a sponsor of the playground Lineberger Orthodontics wanted to come and help make the event even more festive by providing free popcorn and cotton candy Donaldson said “and we more than welcomed them.”

Music filled the air courtesy of DJ Scott Vaughn as the children played on the playground before the official ribbon-cutting thus making it even more of a celebratory occasion.

Dr. Jason Gardner Mooresville Graded School District superintendent commented that this was “an exciting day a lot of collaboration with our Parent Teacher Organization the school system and local businesses with Lowe’s to make this happen. And we’re just excited to provide something that our kids will enjoy for years to come.”

Roger Hyatt chair of the MGSD Board of Education said he would echo what Gardner said and noted the old saying ‘it takes a village to raise a child.’

“It in fact does. What you see today is physical evidence of that” he said. “And you can also see how excited the children are to have this opportunity. It’s designed for fun physical activity and safety which we always look at safety. And you can tell by the turnout of moms and dads that it’s an exciting time for them too.”

As for LaRusso when asked what it meant to have this area where all the children can be out there he said “I think we always think about schools being a place where kids come and they learn their academics but the playground is the place that they learn how to cooperate how to play how to get along how to share and so our playground is kind of our classroom so to speak for those skills. So it’s invaluable. It’s worth every investment that we make. I think that’s why everybody is so interested in contributing.”

As they prepared to cut the ribbon at the ceremony Donaldson again thanked everyone for their part in getting them to this point including the parents school staff and all of the PIT Crew. LaRusso echoed his thanks to the PIT Crews from last year and the incoming board who as he said “were integral to make this happen” along with Lowe’s and the Pedulla family.

Following the shout of “One two three” LaRusso and Assistant Principal Lani Earnhardt cut the ribbon as confetti filled the air along with cheers and the excited squeals of the many children as they waved their racing flags thus officially opening up the playgrounds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvc3BvcnRzbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMjI2NTE5L01MUy1sYXVuY2gtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1UYXhpLUZvdW50YXMtY2FsbHMtSW50ZXItTWlhbWktZGVmZW5kZXItRGFtaWFuLUxvd2UtTi13b3JkLmh0bWzSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L3Nwb3J0c25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTIyNjUxOS9hbXAvTUxTLWxhdW5jaC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLVRheGktRm91bnRhcy1jYWxscy1JbnRlci1NaWFtaS1kZWZlbmRlci1EYW1pYW4tTG93ZS1OLXdvcmQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taxi Fountas accused of 'calling Inter Miami defender Damian Lowe the n-word',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvc3BvcnRzbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMjI2NTE5L01MUy1sYXVuY2gtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1UYXhpLUZvdW50YXMtY2FsbHMtSW50ZXItTWlhbWktZGVmZW5kZXItRGFtaWFuLUxvd2UtTi13b3JkLmh0bWzSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L3Nwb3J0c25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTIyNjUxOS9hbXAvTUxTLWxhdW5jaC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLVRheGktRm91bnRhcy1jYWxscy1JbnRlci1NaWFtaS1kZWZlbmRlci1EYW1pYW4tTG93ZS1OLXdvcmQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C1690>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Burnett Plaza the tallest building in Fort Worth Texas has been purchased via foreclosure auction for $12.3 million just three years after it was sold for more than $137.5 million according to the Dallas Business Journal.

The 40-story behemoth was bought back by Pinnacle Bank Texas in the auction held on the steps of the Tarrant County courthouse on Tuesday.

Pinnacle had claimed in public filings that the tower's former owner Burnett Cherry Street LLC an affiliate of New York-based Opal Holdings LLC defaulted on a $13 million loan used to purchase the building in 2021.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL21hcmluZXJzL2p1bGlvLXJvZHJpZ3Vlei1wcm92aWRlcy1tcy13aXRoLW11Y2gtbmVlZGVkLXBvd2VyLWJ1cnN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Julio Rodriguez provides M's with much-needed power burst,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The Pentagon announced Thursday that Aurora a subsidiary of Boeing based in Manassas Virginia has received an $8.3 million contract modification to keep working on its mobility seaplane design.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in February 2023 selected Aurora and General Atomics for the program officially called the Liberty Lifter Seaplane Wing-in-Ground Effect.

DARPA originally envisioned Liberty Lifter as having about the same size and capacity of a massive C-17 Globemaster mobility aircraft but has since scaled back the demonstrator program to about the size of a C-130 Hercules. But DARPA’s budget documents for fiscal 2025 show that a future Liberty Lifter aircraft could be built to roughly a C-17′s scale once there’s proof the concept works.

The Globemaster’s wingspan is more than 169 feet its length 174 feet and its height about 55 feet. It can carry 170900 pounds of cargo. In comparison the Hercules’ wingspan is more than 132 feet. The longest of the variants is about 97 feet and the tallest is about 38 feet. One variant can carry a payload of 44500 pounds.

Liberty Lifter is also intended to be able to take off and land in sea state 4 or weather conditions that produce waves of up to about 8 feet and could sustain operations even in sea state 5 or rough waves of up to 13 feet.

General Atomics proposed a version of Liberty Lifter with an unorthodox twin-hull design which was intended to make the aircraft more stable on water. Concept art of General Atomics’ design showed the plane’s noses would have lifted up to deploy cargo and allowed vehicles to directly roll onto a beach.

Aurora’s design was closer to a traditional flying boat aircraft with a single hull and high wings that angled down at the ends. In January Aurora released an image of its updated design which had moved the aircraft’s floats to its wingtips and changed its tail design. Aurora said the new tail which would be shaped like the symbol for pi would better accommodate the plane’s aft cargo door.

DARPA’s Liberty Lifter manager Christopher Kent told Defense News in a statement that the program needed to move efficiently “to create transformational change” and that General Atomics’ design could not meet its ambitious goals.

“When we reached the point where we realized only one performer was meeting our aggressive schedule and technical goals we streamlined the program to continue to deliver innovation” as soon as possible Kent said when asked why DARPA did not continue including General Atomics.

DARPA ultimately chose not to proceed with General Atomics' dual-hull design for Liberty Lifter. (General Atomics)

C. Mark Brinkley a spokesman for General Atomics Aeronautical Systems said in an email to Defense News that the company wants to continue working with DARPA on other programs and wishes the Liberty Lifter program success.

“I think we all recognize the Liberty Lifter concept represents a real technological shift for future combat operations and we made a strong proposal informed by a lot of experience and expertise” Brinkley said. “You always want to win and keep working on these things but more than that we just want to see the program thrive and deliver a unique capability for the warfighter and the nation.”

Aurora Flight Sciences declined to comment on the contract modification. The company is working on the aircraft with ReconCraft a shipyard based in Oregon that has expertise with maritime manufacturing and Leidos subsidiary Gibbs and Cox a naval architecture and marine engineering company.

Aurora will now continue to design its Liberty Lifter and reduce its risk as it gets ready for a preliminary design review in early 2025 DARPA said. If the design review is successful DARPA noted Aurora will continue refining the design and then build its Liberty Lifter.

After that point DARPA said Aurora will float fly and then demonstrate Liberty Lifter’s capabilities with its first flight intended to occur in late 2027 or early 2028.

Marriott believes a blend of in-person and virtual connectivity enhances the associate experience enables collaboration for its global workforce and fuels business performance. This flexible model of work is responsive to associate feedback and will enable Marriott to continue to attract grow and retain top talent. The decision to adopt a hybrid work model was made in the spirit of the company’s values to “Put People First and Embrace Change” and this new building will enable that model through design choices and seamless technology.

Offices including executive offices line the core interior of the building so each associate workstation comes with a view outside through floor-to-ceiling windows and every desk will have access to natural light a sit-stand desk and an ergonomic chair. Informal mixed-seating collaboration stations line the windows on each work floor. More formal meeting rooms with state-of-the-art technology writable surfaces and video capabilities are also available for larger meetings.

As part of the company’s commitment to put people first Marriott has created a best-in-class associate growth center located on the top floor of the new headquarters and named for the company’s long-time Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board J.W. Marriott Jr. who is now the company’s Chairman Emeritus. The J.W. Marriott Jr. Associate Growth Center represents the company’s commitment to its people-first culture – one that both physically and figuratively puts associates at the top.

Part of the Bethesda Community

Marriott’s new headquarters has several features that are designed to enable interaction between the company and the Bethesda community where the new HQ is located. The company intends to name the outdoor public plaza between the hotel and new headquarters building Sorenson Plaza in honor of the Company’s late Chief Executive Officer Arne M. Sorenson who passed away in 2021. Arne was highly involved in the design of the new headquarters and was excited about the prospect that the plaza would be a gathering place for associates and a vibrant space for the community.

BETHESDA MD — Marriott International celebrated the opening of its new global headquarters in downtown Bethesda on Monday where top company officials and local lawmakers gathered for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

In 2016 following discussions with the state and Montgomery County Marriott announced plans to stay in Maryland and move from its Fernwood Road headquarters to the new location in downtown Bethesda. The new LEEDv4 Gold-certified headquarters building at 7750 Wisconsin Ave. stands 21 stories tall and provides about 785000 square feet of space for more than 3500 Marriott workers. The building has 2842 workspaces including offices workstations and flexible spaces along with 180 conference rooms.

Marriott made some adjustments to the building’s layout in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including reducing individual workspaces by about 25 percent and increasing the flexible spaces. The new building also will serve as a global hub for Marriott’s research and development operation featuring its innovation and design lab a premium test kitchen and beverage bar as well as “model” hotel rooms in the adjacent Marriott hotel.

“We are thrilled to be welcoming associates to our new headquarters” Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano said at the ceremony. “The campus has been designed to better connect our global workforce in support of our hotels and teams around the world. Empowering associates and accelerating innovation were our key priorities and central in every decision we made to deliver a compelling environment for associates to work learn and thrive.” Maryland Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford presented a Governor’s Citation to Capuano at the ceremony.

“It was my honor to celebrate the opening of Marriott International’s new global headquarters in Montgomery County” Rutherford said. “Through our long-standing partnership our administration is proud to support Marriott and its leadership as the company continues to cement its legacy worldwide while staying committed to supporting Maryland’s economy and tourism industry.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan who took part in the groundbreaking for the site in 2018 was traveling to South Korea on state business and was unable to attend Monday's ceremony.

“Marriott has called Maryland home since 1955 and their new state-of-the-art headquarters in Bethesda ensures that Marriott will continue to call Maryland home for generations to come” Hogan said in a statement. “We take great pride in Marriott as a Maryland institution that is a powerful economic engine and committed community partner. The new headquarters is the perfect place for Marriott to continue its work as the world’s largest hospitality company.” Maryland Lt. Gov.

We are very glad to have you here” Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich who participated in the ceremony said in a statement.

A new 12-story Marriott Hotel which opened in the spring is adjacent to the office building.



Marriott intends to name the outdoor public plaza between the hotel and new headquarters building Sorenson Plaza in honor of the company’s late CEO Arne M. Sorenson who died in 2021.

Thomas VanHow doing his ""best work"" as an Aviation Ambassador at WMU

When things don't go well Thomas VanHowe is a testimony to the song lyrics ""Pick yourself up dust yourself off and start all over again.""



His job interview for being selected as a student ambassador for the Western Michigan University College of Aviation should have been taped to serve as a lesson on how not to do it. Today he is a first officer for Delta Air Lines and based out of its Detroit hub.



VanHowe served his ambassadorial duties from 2013 to 2015. The surprise is he was ever in that position in the first place. ""I had a blast doing it (being an ambassador)"" VanHowe recalls admitting that the interviewing process ""hilariously"" went off the rails. ""To make matters worse I put the wrong telephone number on my resume. Luckily it was my grandmother's number and she was able to connect me. It was my first real interview it was abysmal and the lessons were learned.""

Request College of Aviation Information

VanHowe raised in Eminem's home territory of Macomb Township northwest of Detroit learned those lessons rather well if his resume is any indication. Being an ambassador he says polished his ""people skills"" and connected him to a cadre of current and past College of Aviation students. An immediate benefit was landing an ""amazing"" flight-operations internship as a junior with MASCO Corp. a manufacturer of home-improvement and building products based in nearby Livonia and operating 38 facilities around the world. ""I worked on numerous projects in the corporate-flight department and got a real look into Part 91 (FAA flight regulations relating to corporations)"" he says.

VanHow passing his last checkride at WMU

After his WMU graduation with a degree in aviation flight science in 2015 VanHowe stayed in the air as a flight instructor at the Oakland County International Airport near Detroit adding about 100 hours per month in the sky to his pilot records. He parlayed a Michigan Business Aviation Association scholarship into qualifying for a PIC (pilot in command) rating for all Citation 500 aircraft. That led him to part-time flying contracts and convinced him he was headed for corporate aviation.



Not quite and not yet. SkyWest Airlines based in St. George Utah beckoned. The largest regional airline on the continent in many capacities SkyWest books 2400 flights daily to destinations in the United States Canada and Mexico. Because First Officer VanHowe flew out of Detroit he was part of the SkyWest recruitment team that visited the College of Aviation and other training institutions looking for new personnel.



In early 2019 the 2012 graduate of Dakota High in the Chippewa Valley School District was upgraded to the rank of captain in Skywest. After an interview later that year he joined Delta in February of 2020 and began training on its fleet of A320s. Then something called Covid put the industry into a deep-freeze. While passengers quit flying cargo did not. For six months from November to May of 2021 VanHowe captained on-demand DC-9 flights for USA Jet Airlines a cargo service located at Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti all over the continent. He's been wearing the Delta uniform aboard A320s for the last 10 months.

Passing the Captain upgrade at SkyWest. The fake mustache was a ""required"" component of the training

No doubt Covid was a downer for the aviation industry but it provided VanHowe with a golden opportunity. ""I was lucky enough (and equipped with the right ratings) to land that USA Jet Airlines job of flying a DC-9"" he says. ""I got to fly an airplane I never thought I would in my career. I learned a ton. The DC-9 is an amazing machine. Because of the pandemic I got the opportunity to see a side of aviation I had never seen before. I can now say I've flown corporate aircraft airliners and cargo.""



His SkyWest days brought special memories and ""the most fun I ever had flying."" For more than 300 flights over six consecutive months Captain VanHowe's first officer was his fiancee. The future Brooke (Patterson) VanHowe (if she chooses that name at their June wedding) also now flies an A320 for United Air Lines out of the Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. ""Now that we work at different airlines"" he says ""I'm pretty bummed we won't get to do that again."" At least not in the immediate future.

VanHow and George Maciak on a hike in Salt Lake City

There's more in VanHowe's Skywest scrapbook. His roommate for the airline's new-hire training in Salt lake City was the guy he shared living quarters with back at Western -- George Maciak. ""We were simulation partners at SkyWest and had an absolute blast."" By the way also in that pilot training class was a female candidate with the first name of Brooke.



""Growing up"" he says ""I always wanted to become a pilot but I wasn't quite certain how to achieve that dream. Online research introduced me to some good flight-school programs at universities. It turned out that Western's was right down the road. After my family toured the campus and saw the College of Aviation I never applied to another school.""



Classes in advanced aircraft systems and instrument ground school provided insights and perspectives that proved relevant as he advanced in his career. Professor Lori Brown trained in Australia involved in the industry since 1988 and boasting of a resume that would make Amelia Earhart jealous ""was downright the most helpful instructor I've ever had"" VanHowe says. ""She is truly passionate about aviation and really cares about the success and understanding of each of her students.""

VanHowe and fellow SkyWest pilot (and fiancée) Brooke prior to her heading to captain training

Some kudos are also aimed at Jay Orwin a WMU alumnus who formerly served as the director of aviation at MASCO. ""As an intern there and even up to this day he has spent so much time teaching helping and guiding me through school and the next steps to reach my goals. I hope I can be half as helpful to those interested in aviation as he has been to me.""



A subliminal message passed on by the College of Aviation throughout his four years at Western was effective time management. ""I was working different jobs flying and taking classes all at the same time"" he says. ""I learned quickly how to manage my time well to be able to get everything done.""



That's part of the ""give-back"" advice he passes on to current aviation students during his recruitment pitches and when taking part in the college's Aviation Outlook Day. ""Like so many others"" VanHowe says "" I would not be where I am today without the guidance of people who have 'been there done that.' I am open to answering their questions about which path to choose. I want to pass on what I've done well and what I wish I had done differently.

Engaging in some aviation outreach VanHowe continues to give back and introduce students to the wonder of aviation

Polishing his resume were memberships in Western's chapters of Alpha Eta Rho the career-promoting coed fraternity that links the aviation industry and institutions of higher education and Sigma Phi Epsilon. ""Both have given me life-long mentors and friends in the aviation community and elsewhere"" he says. ""Those connections are priceless.""



While still in his bachelor days VanHowe enjoys running hiking golfing and ""petting other people's dogs."" The best part of his job he says ""is traveling and the opportunity to see and explore places."" Time off from the job also enhances the opportunity to travel to destinations not part of his flight plans. And also to run hike golf and be friendly to other people's pets.



VanHowe says he became interested in aviation when he was about 4. ""I flew on a Northwest Airlines B757 from Detroit to Orlando Fla. The captain took me up front to show me the cockpit and he gave me a set of wings. I thought that was the coolest thing. From that day forward I knew I wanted to be an airline pilot. I started telling people -- 'When I grow up I want to be a Northwest Airlines pilot.'""



Goal achieved -- somewhat. Northwest operational since 1926 merged with Delta in 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the vast expanses of degraded land opportunities for restoration abound. Investors and funders are spending real money to support new initiatives and communities and pledges to protect plant and restore more than 1 trillion trees have inspired millions of people to act. Now the bad news: There’s little information about what happens to those trees once they’re in the ground. How many survive? Are they truly restoring ecosystems and storing carbon as they grow? Are local communities benefiting from those trees? Those key metrics of success are rarely tracked after saplings are dug into the soil. Most organizations seeking funding for restoration projects are earnest. As with anything else there are a few bad actors seeking to turn consumer money into trees that won’t grow tall and strong in the long term. But the thousands of locally led organizations that invest passion energy and expertise into planting trees do have a positive impact on people and the planet. So how do they measure their impact?

The Philippines is one of the world’s 17 mega-biodiverse countries and its forests and oceans sequester huge amounts of carbon. But accelerating development and other factors are taking a toll. Reforestation is one strategy to protect these ecosystems. (Photo credit: Conservation International Philippines) Conservation International and World Resources Institute have developed a field-test version of our Tree Restoration Monitoring Framework. This tool was developed for the Priceless Planet Coalition a restoration alliance led by Mastercard that aims to restore 100 million trees over five years. All 18 projects funded by the Coalition now monitor 13 required and six optional metrics of success and will continue to do so in the five years after they plant each tree. These indicators capture the transformation of saplings into trees and document the potential benefits of restoration for local communities climate and biodiversity. Tree growers follow detailed instructions or protocols that explain exactly how to collect the data ensuring that progress is tracked consistently across the portfolio. Every protocol is applicable to any tree-growing project around the world and covers a wide range of techniques ranging from the more traditional such as tree and mangrove planting to the more novel such as efforts that accelerate the recovery of natural forests. To check the collected data researchers at Conservation International and World Resources Institute work hand in hand with tree growers in the field to pinpoint the location of each Priceless Planet Coalition planting site. These digital boundaries help monitor where sprouting trees are making progress toward the framework’s key indicators. This data can help assess the impact of projects and reduce the risk of failure by tracking where fires floods and other threats to the land — what researchers call disturbances — have threatened planting sites in the past. World Resources Institute and Conservation International use these geospatial boundaries field-collected data and cutting-edge satellite techniques to assess important metrics of success for each site such as the percentage of land covered by trees and the estimated amount of planet-warming carbon stored (see graphic below). This framework is different from others in the tree restoration sector because it emphasizes a limited number of metrics and provides clear guidance on how to collect the data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGF5cGVycy5jb20vb25saW5lLXBheW1lbnRzL2MyNC1iYW5rLWludHJvZHVjZXMtdmlydHVhbC1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLS0xMjU4NDE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,C24 Bank has announced offering its customers up to 8 virtual cards in addition to the physical Mastercard.,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thepaypers.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /online-payments/c24-bank-introduces-virtual-mastercard--1258416 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239516A09D0>, 'Connection to thepaypers.com timed out.

The world’s largest payment processors are Visa Mastercard and American Express.

Morrisey states that flagging gun sales under its own category puts an unnecessary red flag on legitimate purchases. Gun store sales are under “general merchandise” as far as credit card purchases are concerned. Morrisey suggests that the decision to flag purchases “appears to be a cave-in to pressures from radical gun control groups and those who are anti- Second Amendment.”

In addition to being aware of solutions like cryptocurrency digital cards biometric payments Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and open banking consumers in South Africa are increasingly and actively using these solutions for various financial transactions in their everyday lives.

Mastercard’s New Payments Index 2022 found that 95% of people in South Africa have used at least at one emerging digital payment method in the last year.

The study found that while in-person purchases remain common consumers are making purchases in increasingly diverse ways such as with loyalty points or store credit cards and via a range of digital purchasing activities.

In the last six months 67% of consumers have made a purchase from an online marketplace 66% have bought something from a mobile app and 49% have bought a service via an online subscription.

Usage of digital payments increasing

While traditional payment methods like cash and swiping or inserting a credit card still have traction the use of emerging digital payments are gaining momentum.

Three quarters of users increased use of at least one emerging digital payment method in the last year. An overwhelming 97% indicated that they are likely to use a digital payment method in the next 12 months with account-to-account payments (86%) digital money transfer apps (81%) instant payment services (80%) and digital credit or debit cards (78%) topping the list.

The Index confirmed that security is top of mind when deciding what payment methods to use in South Africa as well as globally. Interestingly traditional payment methods are still viewed as more secure than emerging digital methods with 79% of South African consumers saying that swiping or inserting a debit or credit card is the most secure way to pay.

Beyond security South Africans cited ease of use (51%) and the rewards offered (44%) as differentiators when deciding which payment method to use.

“Consumers in South Africa have consistently shown a willingness to adopt innovative new technologies—and payments are no exception.

At Mastercard we are committed to understanding the unique needs and preferences of the people residing in the markets we serve and to continue partnering with the public and private sectors to develop market-relevant solutions as we build an inclusive and connected digital future that works for everyone” said Gabriel Swanepoel Country Manager at Mastercard Southern Africa.

The Mastercard new Payments Index 2022 further shows:

High Awareness of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) instalments as a budgeting tool

There is a high awareness of BNPL instalments as a budgeting tool with 91% of South African consumers saying they are familiar with the concept and 27% saying they have used it in the past year.

However while consumers want the flexibility and convenience of BNPL they want the security associated with a trusted provider like a bank or payment network.

Consumers find BNPL useful for big-ticket purchases and emergency use as well as increased purchasing power. They also find it useful for unique use cases including as a budgeting and financial planning tool.

Receptiveness to more direct Account-to-Account (A2A) payments

The majority of consumers are seeking greater agility to optimize bill payments prioritizing control flexibility convenience and integrated payment technologies.

Most consumers are open to direct account-to-account payment options by linking their account to a merchant site or utility provider for future purchases.

Consumers are relying on digital channels for paying bills because it’s more convenient and optimizes financial management.

Sixty percent of South African consumers say it helps them to budget and manage their money better while 51% say they are using digital tools in order to set up recurring payments.

In all 84% of consumers agree they would like to be able to make purchases or pay bills directly from their bank account without inputting card details.

Consumers turning to fintech and indirectly open banking to accomplish everyday finance needs

Consumers are relying on digital tools to accomplish everyday financial tasks with 71% of South Africans using fintech for five or more tasks with banking and paying bills emerging as top use cases.

Most consumers know about open banking – the ability to share your banking data with other financial service providers – and are using it to pay their bills do their banking secure or refinance loans and make BNPL payments.

South African consumers cite faster transactions (60%) and the ease of tracking transactions between accounts (59%) as the biggest benefits of open banking and linking accounts.

Eight in ten consumers agree they feel safe using apps to send money to people or businesses from their phone and close to half agree they are comfortable sharing financial information with apps to have access to payment tools that help them manage their money.

Biometrics offer convenience and security at checkout though data access concerns remain

Consumers recognize the increased convenience and security that Biometrics can offer with 75% agreeing it is easier to make payments using biometrics than a card or a device.

The potential for security optimization is also evident to consumers with roughly three-quarters agreeing biometric technologies for identity and payments is more secure than a PIN password or other form of identification and more secure than two factor authentication via text or email.

While consumers do have some concerns about what entities have access to their biometric data they are still open to using it given the time it saves with the majority of consumers either having used it or are planning to make use of biometric data.

As consumers shop bank and transact digitally more than ever before Mastercard continues to strengthen its digital payment capabilities in South Africa and across the wider EEMEA region.

Its trusted technology solutions are being used for new use cases brought to market through various partnerships with fintechs governments financial institutions digital giants and telecom operators.

By tapping into multi-rail capabilities to create competitive localized solutions Mastercard is accelerating the transfer of value in new ways on multiple rails thereby advancing a bright future for inclusive commerce.

18/09/22 • 3 MINUTE READ

Great Britain have gone out of the 2022 Davis Cup Finals in the group stages – finishing third in Group D.

The Brits’ chances of qualification for the Finals came to an end after two close losses to USA and Netherlands in deciding doubles matches. Returning on Sunday and playing for pride the Brits finished their campaign in Glasgow with a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan.

""It’s been tough – I think everyone here would have loved a trip to Malaga in November"" said Britain's captain Leon Smith.

""We’ve had chances in every match and it just felt like it wasn’t going our way this week but I think it’s great to finish with a win. I’m really glad we bought the Davis Cup to Glasgow and I have to say a big thank you to the fans.""

Netherlands and USA both progress as the top two teams in the group and will have the chance to compete for the title later this year at the Finals in Malaga. They will be joined by Italy Croatia Australia Germany Canada and Spain as the best performing teams from the other three groups.

Britain’s singles stars enjoyed mixed success throughout the week. Cam Norrie kicked off with an impressive comeback win over world No.12 Taylor Fritz but lost out to strong performances from Botic van de Zandschlup and Alexander Bublik.

Dan Evans narrowly lost in three-sets to Tommy Paul in the Brits opener but bounced back with a comfortable 6-4 6-4 victory over Tallon Griekspoor. Andy Murray came in for the third tie against Kazakhstan and clinched his 41st Davis Cup win up against Dmitry Popko.

Murray and world No.1 Joe Salisbury suffered devastating losses in two high-quality deciding rubbers against USA and Netherlands. Rajeev Ram and Jack Sock came from a set down to defeat the Brits 5-7 6-4 7-5 while Wesley Koolhof and Matwe Middelkoop won arguably the match of the group 7-6(0) 6-7(6) 6-3.

However teaming up with Neal Skupski Salisbury made it third time lucky as the Brits secured the Brits their first tie win of the tournament against Bublik and Aleksandr Nedovysev - coming through 7-6(2) 6-7(9) 7-6(4).",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA World Cup 2022: USA fixtures in Qatar schedule match timings where to watch,"This will be the 11th appearance for the USA will be making its 11th appearance in the FIFA World Cup. Making its first appearance in 1930 when it reached the semifinals it enjoyed participation in seven successive editions from 1990 to 2014 but the run ended when it failed to qualify for Russia 2018.

USA qualified for Qatar 2022 after placing third in the CONCACAF Third Round of qualification. It managed to win seven of the 14 matches it played drawing four and losing three.

USA despite not being one of the favourites to win the tournament definitely has the players to make it past the group stage. With the likes of Christian Pulisic Weston Mckenny Giovanni Reyna and Sergino Dest it can upset some of the big names in the World Cup.

The country has failed to find the net in only one of their last ten World Cup matches. The only team who managed to keep a clean sheet against the USA was Germany which claimed a 1-0 victory when the two nations met in the group stage at Brazil 2014.

At least that’s what the Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you’re always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

“Yes I had offers. The temptation was not there” he told reporters on Friday via the team’s website. “South Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it’s just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.”

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. “I feel like in today’s world loyalty is kind of an afterthought” he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. “South Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.”

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We’ll see how loyalty influences McCormick’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn’t mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

“I think that’s just the way I was raised” he said. “People that are good to you you should be great to them and give back to them. That’s just the way it’s always been for me.”

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do."""

It happened at a location on Delancey Street on the Lower East Side.

A video posted to social media showed a dispute between Michael Palacios 31 and three other men.

The dispute turned physical with the three men smacking and punching Palacios who was seemingly unaffected by the assault.

Palacios then put down his backpack and removed an ax. The NYPD says he then threatened his attackers. He then allegedly smashed a table and a glass wall.

Finally he smacked someone who was sitting at a table and knocked them to the floor.

The McKesson Corporation has agreed to purchase Overland Park-prescribed Rx Savings Solutions in a deal worth nearly $1 billion.

McKesson announced Monday that it had entered into an agreement with the prescription pricing startup valued at up to $875 million — more than double the $425 million price tag for which Kansas City-built Backlot Cars exited in 2020 making the sale the largest startup exit in the history of the metro.

“By joining McKesson we will be able to offer an exceptionally broad set of services to our clients and strengthen our leadership in prescription price transparency” said Michael Rea founder and CEO.

“This is a critical part of our growth journey and we are excited about what the future holds for Rx Savings Solutions as part of McKesson.”

The deal guarantees RxSS a $600 million upfront payment and additional funds up to $275 million contingent upon its financial performance through 2025 the companies said in a release.

McKesson said the acquisition is in line with its plans for strategic growth successfully connecting the biopharma space with payer services.

“Rx Savings Solutions’ offerings for employers and patients will strengthen McKesson’s ability to help solve the most common medication challenges related to access affordability and adherence” said Brian Tyler CEO.

“We expect the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions to accelerate McKesson’s growth priority in biopharma services by extending our ecosystem of differentiated medication access solutions to patients. Together with Rx Savings Solutions McKesson will amplify our efforts to advance health outcomes for all.”

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Financial details and the exact terms of the deal were not disclosed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvbWVyY2stbXJrLWVhcm5pbmdzLXExLTIwMjQuaHRtbNIBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L21lcmNrLW1yay1lYXJuaW5ncy1xMS0yMDI0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck beats earnings expectations raises outlook on strong Keytruda and vaccine sales,"The exterior view of the entrance to Merck headquarters in Rahway New Jersey on Feb. 5 2024.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L3N0b2Nrcy1tYWtpbmctdGhlLWJpZ2dlc3QtbW92ZXMtcHJlbWFya2V0LW1ldGEtcGxhdGZvcm1zLWhvbmV5d2VsbC1tZXJjay1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks making biggest moves premarket: Meta Merck Southwest and more,Check out the companies making headlines before the bell: Meta Platforms — The Facebook parent company plunged more than 14% after issuing lighter-than-expected second-quarter revenue guidance .

Fast facts

Ahn Hyoung-hwan the vice chairman of Korea Communications Commission (KCC) asked O’Connell and Meta (formerly known as Facebook Inc.) to cooperate on safety in nascent virtual platforms such as the metaverse according to local media reports.

Ahn and O’Connell also discussed transparency in algorithms behind digital platforms and preventing the circulation of illegal information.

Meta operates Horizon Worlds a metaverse platform supported by virtual reality (VR) technology available for users in North America and parts of Europe.

There have been reports of users experiencing sexual assault on Horizon Worlds which has prompted Meta to adopt a personal boundary system which sets a four-foot distance between a user’s avatar and others with the exception of designated friends.

South Korea is also battling the presence of sexual predators on the metaverse — the Korea Communications Commission has launched a council earlier this year to prohibit such behavior.

A leaked internal report recently revealed that Instagram Reels get 10 times less engagement than videos on TikTok.

But Meta has seen more success with business messaging which Mark Zuckerberg highlighted as a priority during Meta’s Q2 earnings call in July.

Meta estimates that around a billion people per week communicate with a business or service account across WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram. And roughly 40% of Meta’s advertisers globally (more than 4 million) use click-to-message ads which redirect people from Facebook or Instagram into one of Meta’s messaging products to chat with a business.

The company told investors last quarter that click-to-message advertising is “a multibillion-dollar business” for Meta with double-digit year-over-year growth.

“It’s one of our fastest-growing ad products” said Dan Levy VP of business messaging at Meta. He took on the role in late 2018 after more than six years as VP of small business.

The messaging opportunity is threefold Levy said. Businesses can use messaging to market to their existing customers to manage user-initiated service requests or to accomplish a functional task like resetting a password.

“Our job is to create products that make all of those use cases as easy as possible for everyone” Levy said.

Levy spoke with AdExchanger.

AdExchanger: Why transition from focusing on ad sales and ad products for small businesses to focusing on messaging?

DAN LEVY: I’m betting my career on business messaging and the reason why dates back to a trip I made to Southeast Asia in around 2013 to 2014 where I saw firsthand that businesses were using ads to direct people to messaging products because that was how people wanted to communicate.

One business in Singapore literally had something like 30 smartphones Velcroed to the wall that they used to stay on top of their messages from customers. But that can’t scale.

The promise of messaging is personal interaction that feels similar to how you’d be able to interact with a business in the real world. The challenge is figuring out how to scale that and bring in automation while keeping the personal touch.

How would you describe Meta’s approach to business messaging?

You’ve got to build the right consumer experience first because businesses will go where the people are.

There’s no question that we’re already living in a messaging-first world and now businesses are adapting. On our side click-to-message ads are going well and we recently launched the cloud API for WhatsApp so businesses can initiate conversations and message users directly usually for marketing purposes.

But we also recently completed the acquisition of Kustomer which is a broader investment we’re making in customer service tools that help make business messaging and CRM management easier.

Is the idea here that advertising can be a utility?

Messaging in general is a utility. When I was in Europe this summer the hotel didn’t even want me calling the front desk. I was able to take care of everything I needed by messaging back and forth with the hotel whether that was checking in or making a service inquiry.

There’s been an evolution in consumer communication behavior. Communication is about threads.

What do you mean when you say “communication is about threads”?

The way people communicate with businesses is starting to look a lot like how they communicate with their friends and family.

This is more the case outside the US though. The US has been a bit of a laggard. People in the US don’t always realize what a big deal messaging is everywhere else in the world. We have more than a billion people on our messaging platforms every week.

How many of those interactions are with chatbots and how do you make sure the experience is good? I’ve tried to resolve issues in the past using a company’s chatbot and I usually end up having to call customer service anyway which is frustrating.

A lot of questions can be answered simply using automation like queries about store hours or the status of an order. That’s how a lot of businesses use our products today. You can take care of somewhere between 50% and 70% of queries through an automated system.

But if the conversation is more complicated or more valuable that’s when you transition to a live human.

Regardless it’s powerful to have all of these communications in one canonical thread rather than having different systems for email or phone or chat. The service experience should be built around the person not around the ticket or the type of technology you use to deal with it.

Is WhatsApp or Messenger better for business use cases than say Instagram Direct or vice versa?

Businesses don’t really have to think about that. We optimize messages so that they’re delivered on the messaging service where we think a person is most likely to respond. And businesses have a unified inbox so they can respond to any message in one place as opposed to having to hop between apps.

What are you doing to encourage more messaging-first behavior in the US?

There are entry points on Facebook and Instagram where people can directly message a business through their page. And we have click-to-message ads of course.

But there are also generational trends we’ve been paying attention to. We’ve surveyed younger people who say that they prefer to message a business rather than calling or emailing them.

And so I think we’re going to see more businesses adapt to this behavior because they have to. Businesses always have to go where the people are.

Photo by Jasper Smith.

Having secured their seats on one of three buses 160 Howard University students embarked from Cramton auditorium to the MetLife Stadium to attend the HBCU NY Classic Game on Saturday Sep. 17. Students arrived on campus at 6 a.m. dressed head-to-toe in red and blue Howard gear ready to enjoy the football tailgate and watch the Bison take on the Morehouse College Tigers.

Terri-Lee Stephenson a freshman psychology major was most excited to support her school and the football team on this trip. “I love football so going to a football game for my HBCU is quite the experience. It’s the first trip with my friends not having my mom there” she said.

After traveling four hours on the “spirit” buses paid for by Jordan Brand students arrived at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey. Students were welcomed by members of the Jordan Brand who escorted them to the Jordan Brand Tailgate Experience. Jordan Brand provided sandwiches an array of snacks and drinks games music and raffles for merchandise all in an exclusive area for Howard students.

Dominick Lewis the global brand marketing specialist for Jordan Brand and 2016 Howard alumnus has been working with Jordan Brand for nearly a year and a half. When the Howard graduate found out his role in the 20-year partnership between Howard and Jordan Brand he described it as a “dream come true.”

“Purpose means community in Jordan Brand. Ever since the video announcement dropped in August we’ve been activated. We showed up at Bison Week and now we’re doing the Classic. We really just want to impact students and faculty really show love and embrace the HBCU culture. We’re bringing two excellent Black brands together” Lewis said.

Like Lewis hundreds of Howard alumni were in attendance at the tailgate and the HBCU NY Classic Game to show support for the Bison. William North III who graduated from Howard in 1986 attended with his daughter another recent Howard graduate.

“It’s always good to see the University to see Howard and Morehouse. I went to it when I was much younger and I’m still going to it. Plus it brings money to our universities. We have to let our young university students know that we support them 100 percent. This game needs to have a big crowd so we can continue to do this.” North III said. MetLife recorded an attendance of over 35000 people at the game.

The Bison won the game 31-0 against the Tigers making it their first win of the season. Before getting on the buses to travel back to their campuses and homes dozens of Howard University and Morehouse College students danced together in the parking lot of the stadium while having an “H-U You Know!” versus “Whose house? Morehouse!” chant-off.

Reading time 1:04 min

MGM Grand announced the remodeling of 700 rooms of Studio Tower (formerly known as the West Wing) one of its hotel towers. In the announcement gaming and hospitality giant MGM Resorts International said that ""the rooms will reflect a retro desert feel with mid-century modern design and décor aesthetic."" The rooms are expected to be available later this year.

MGM Resorts Design Group partnered with Los Angeles-based Avenue Interior Design for the remodeling. The company said they ""drew inspiration from the mid-century design style of Palm Springs incorporating a desert palette of fresh pinks and chartreuse greens with clean lines and soft shapes.""

The rooms will feature rounded window seats enlarged headboards and curated artwork. The bathrooms will have space-saving barn doors an illuminated vanity marble shower floors and new chrome fixtures. Completion of all rooms is scheduled for December 2022 with the first collection of rooms available for guest stays in late October 2022.

Michael Neubecker president and chief operating officer of the MGM Grand said in a statement: ""We wanted to make a fresh statement with our new Studio Tower rooms by creating a relaxing atmosphere that appeals to not only leisure travelers here on vacation but also our business travelers looking for a refreshing reprieve after a long day of meetings.""

""With this remodel we found innovative ways to enlarge spaces and upgrade amenities while adding modern conveniences so our guests can truly enjoy a comfortable sanctuary during their stay"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2J1c2luZXNzam91cm5hbC5jb20vRGFpbHkvSXNzdWVzLzIwMjIvMDkvMTkvRnJhbmNoaXNlcy9BY2VzLU1hcmstRGF2aXMtV05CQS13aW4uYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Aces captures first WNBA Championship,"WNBA Las Vegas Aces owner Mark Davis believes that the team's championship win yesterday is ""vindication for the approach he and the team’s front office have taken since joining the WNBA” according to Andy Yamashita of the LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL. Davis who bought the Aces from MGM Resorts in 2021 said “That’s what our goal was from the very beginning when we bought this team to win on and off the court.” Davis “heaped praise on his leadership team"" and was “complimentary of the work"" President Nikki Fargas GM Natalie Williams Chief Business Development Officer Jennifer Azzi and coach Becky Hammon have done to help the franchise capture its first title. But Davis also said that this is ""just the beginning of his investment in the Aces."" He has been ""vocal about paying players the wages necessary to prevent them from having to play abroad” and he “spent the money necessary to bring Hammon over from the NBA.” The Aces also are ""building a permanent training facility in Henderson"" which is “expected to be ready ahead of the 2023 season” (LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL 9/19).

RAISE THE STAKES: USA TODAY’s Nancy Armour notes when Davis bought the Aces he “insisted this was not a lark or a charity project.” He wanted to “elevate the players the team and the league"" and he was ""willing to invest the resources needed to do it.” It is ""one thing to build a team that can contend for one title"" however and another to ""build an organization that can do it year in and year out.” By doing the latter Davis and the Aces are “going to force the rest of the WNBA to step up their games.” Though the WNBA is in its 26th season it still “often operates as if it’s grateful for whatever it gets.” But Davis will not “settle until the league and every other owner be they of existing franchises or those looking to join in the party shares his attitude.” Davis: “I know I’m going to be pushing for a lot of different things.

As per scientists it takes the human brain 25 years to reach full maturity but new research claims that the AI used by Elon musk's Tesla could equal that in only 17 years.

Researchers have long predicted that artificial intelligence will eventually surpass human intelligence although there are different predictions as to when that will happen.

Watch | World Business Watch: Tesla sued by drivers over autopilot full self-driving features According to a study by Autotrader company Vanarama Tesla's new microchip will be ""more intelligent"" than humans by 2033.

The study points out that it already has processing capability equivalent to 36 per cent of a human brain. About 100 billion neurons make up a human brain which triples in size during a baby's first year and develops fully by the age of 25.

""Tesla's new D1 microchip is more powerful than any the manufacturer has previously used in its cars – managing 362 trillion operations per second. Its processing power is already over a third (36 per cent) of a human's brain which is capable of one quadrillion operations per second.""

In comparison the first chip an Nvidia component from 2016 achieved ""only"" 12 trillion.

By analysing both current and prior models the organisation discovered that the capability of Tesla microchips is growing at a pace of 486 per cent every year.

The new D1 chip which is a component of the Dojo supercomputer platform and the company's Autopilot self-driving system will soon be made available by Musk's company.

It wouldn't be insane to think that technology will surpass humans in intelligence within our lifetimes says Vanaram.

""Microchips are currently capable of working the way brain synapses do with researchers developing chips that are inspired by the way the brain operates.""

But widespread medical use of tattoos has been limited because of the need for repeated needle injections that can be painful and carry risks of bleeding and infection.

Now scientists have developed a way to avoid these deterrents: a tattoo patch containing microscopic needles that can quickly color skin without causing pain or drawing blood. These single-use microneedle tattoo patches work for both color images and for markings visible only with ultraviolet illumination according to a study published September 14 in iScience.

“We've miniaturized the needle so that it's painless but still effectively deposits tattoo ink in the skin” said the senior study author Mark Prausnitz PhD of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta in a statement.

“This could be a way not only to make medical tattoos more accessible but also to create new opportunities for cosmetic tattoos because of the ease of administration” said Dr. Prausnitz an inventor of the patches who cofounded Micron Biomedical to test them and bring them to market.

Up to about one-third of U.S. adults have at least one tattoo research published in the December 2019 issue of the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology suggests. And so do nearly half of adults under 40 years old.

Though tattoo inks are injected into the skin they’re not regulated as medical products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Instead they’re subject to less-stringent regulations used for cosmetics. Risks of tattoos include infection — especially when needles or inks are contaminated — as well as allergic reactions.

The new study wasn’t designed to test the safety or efficacy of microneedle tattoos compared with traditional application processes.

Microneedles are already used for a variety of cosmetic and anti-aging products. For years scientists have also tested microneedles as a potential needle-free way to administer medicines and vaccines Prausnitz said.

Medical tattoos are currently used to cover scars target radiation for cancer treatments and restore the appearance of nipples after breast surgery. There’s potential too to use tattoos instead of medical alert bracelets to identify people with severe allergies or serious medical conditions like diabetes or epilepsy.

Tattoos normally require large needles to repeatedly puncture the skin to deposit enough ink for a good image. The new microneedles are themselves made of tattoo ink with a dissolvable casing that enables them to create a lasting image after they're pressed to the skin just once.

To apply these microneedle tattoos scientists crafted small molds with the microneedles arranged in a pattern forming the desired image. Then they filled the molds with tattoo ink and added a patch backing. Tattooing with these microneedles is as simple as applying the patch to the skin for a few minutes — long enough for the microneedles to dissolve and release the ink.

In early tests of this approach tattoos lasted for a full year suggesting that this approach is likely to create permanent images. This held true for traditional tattoo ink as well as invisible inks that appear under ultraviolet light or higher temperatures — an approach that may offer more privacy to patients who want the images to be visible only under certain circumstances.

It’s also possible that microneedle tattoos could be used to apply temporary ink for short-term medical needs — for example to identify the correct arm or leg for a procedure — or for cosmetic images that people don’t want to keep for a lifetime. Animals might also get microneedle patch tattoos instead of having their ears clipped or tagged for tracking.

“The goal isn't to replace all tattoos which are often works of beauty created by tattoo artists” Prausnitz said. “Our goal is to create new opportunities for patients pets and people who want a painless tattoo that can be easily administered.”"

Azure the company’s cloud computing arm is focused on building out software tools and partnerships within the industry rather than launching its own hardware into space.

Azure Space launched in Oct. 2020. It’s apparently been quite busy since then.

The Microsoft space unit made a slew of product and partnership announcements in Paris last week at WSBW. We’ll run through them here along with highlights from a Payload interview with Jason Zander Microsoft’s EVP of strategic missions and technologies.

#1: Azure Orbital Cloud Access (in private preview)

This new service is targeted toward unlocking high-bandwidth low-latency applications from anywhere on the globe said Zander. Azure Orbital Cloud Access leverages “edge” devices and the Starlink constellation for connectivity. Theoretically that could make this offering available anywhere that’s served by SpaceX’s satellite internet service.

“Starlink’s high-speed low-latency global connectivity in conjunction with Azure infrastructure will enable users to access fiber-like cloud computing access anywhere anytime” SpaceX’s Gwynne Shotwell said in a press release.

But Rome wasn’t built in a day and these services aren’t rolled out in a day either. Microsoft says the service Cloud Access Preview is only available to Azure Government customers.

Microsoft detailed two case studies of its new product offering. Firefighters in Idaho and the Hsinchu Fire Department in Taiwan used services like Microsoft Teams video chat while on the go (and out of service from traditional telco infrastructure). On fixed vs. mobile satellite services Zander said “our goal would not be to narrow between them.”

#2: Ground Station goes into general availability

Image: Microsoft

Azure Orbital is a fully managed ground station as a service product allowing operators to communicate with their satellites (and control them) in low (LEO) or medium (MEO) Earth orbits. Last week Microsoft said Pixxel Loft Orbital and Muon Space had signed on to use the service.

Azure’s ground station is colocated in or near Azure datacenters. Microsoft operates four of its own antennas and plans to grow to 15 in the near future. The company also integrates with partners’ equipment like KSAT’s Global Ground Station network.

Azure Orbital effectively lets companies pull information quickly from space into ~the cloud~. There they can then access and analyze data with the full range of Azure analytics and AI tools.

#3: Making strides in digitizing satellite communications

Azure and ST Engineering iDirect said they demonstrated a satellite modem running as a “fully virtualized piece of software.” Azure will continue to work with traditional ground segment equipment while also supporting new virtualized applications. Microsoft and SES also say they’re creating the world’s first fully virtualized ground station for the latter’s 2nd-gen MEO constellation.

On Microsoft’s go-to-market strategy “We’re partner-led” Zander said. “I’m not designing or launching my own satellites…[which] allows me to get to market a heck of a lot faster because I can work with folks that have already done all that hard work. They are experts—they’re literally rocket scientists.”

Why is Microsoft so invested in space? “Going forward if you do not have a satellite solution you do not have a hyperscale cloud” Zander said. Satellites are complementary to traditional telco networks and Azure is also investing in 5G Zander said but the cloud shouldn’t be confined to areas with cellular connectivity. To build the “world’s computer” as Microsoft calls its cloud internally you’ve got to be able to hit all the edges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzkvMTgvMjMzNTk3NTUvdG9tLWJyYWR5LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1zdXJmYWNlLXRhYmxldC10YW1wYS1iYXktYnVjY2FuZWVycy1zYWludHMtZm9vdGJhbGwtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady just chucked another Microsoft Surface tablet,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.theverge.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/9/18/23359755/tom-brady-microsoft-surface-tablet-tampa-bay-buccaneers-saints-football-nfl (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952A1C7C0>, 'Connection to www.theverge.com timed out.

""These findings indicate that bivalent vaccines may be a new tool in the response to emerging variants"" the researchers wrote.

New version versus old

A team led by Moderna scientists evaluated immune response and safety of the updated booster against Omicron (mRNA-1273.214) its subvariants and previous variants with that of the older Moderna booster (monovalent vaccine; mRNA-1273) against the wild-type virus in 814 participants from Feb 18 to Mar 23 2022. The bivalent booster was designed to target both the wild-type and Omicron viral strains.

Participants who had received the older booster at least 3 months before were given either a dose of the bivalent (437 patients) or monovalent (377) vaccine as a second booster. Median time between the first and second boosters was similar for both vaccine types at about 135 days.

Average participant age was 57.3 years in the bivalent group and 57.5 years in the monovalent group and 59.0% and 50.7% were women respectively. In the bivalent group 22.0% of participants were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as were 26.8% in the monovalent group.

Higher antibody levels against all variants

At 28 days patients with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis had a geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron BA.1 subvariant of 2372.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2070.6 to 2718.2) after receipt of the bivalent booster and 1473.5 (95% CI 1270.8 to 1708.4) after the monovalent booster.

The geometric mean levels of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type strain were 5977.3 (95% CI 5321.9 to 6713.3) among bivalent booster recipients compared with 5649.3 (95% CI 5056.8 to 6311.2) among monovalent recipients.

The bivalent booster generated antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of 727.4 (95% CI 632.8 to 836.1) and 492.1 (95% CI 431.1 to 561.9) against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants respectively (GMT ratio 1.69; 95% CI 1.51 to 1.90). The newer booster also produced greater binding antibody responses against previous strains such as Alpha Beta Gamma and Delta (GMT ratios 1.11 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.19] to 1.24 [95% CI 1.14 to 1.35]).

After adjustment for age-group and pre-booster antibody levels estimated GMTs were 6422.3 (95% CI 5990.1 to 6885.7) and 5286.6 (95% CI 4887.1 to 5718.9) against the wild-type virus 28 days after bivalent and monovalent vaccination respectively (GMT ratio 1.22; 97.5% CI 1.08 to 1.37).

At 28 days estimated GMCs against Omicron were 2479.9 (95% CI 2264.5 to 2715.8) and 1421.2 (95% CI 1283.0 to 1574.4) with the bivalent and monovalent boosters respectively (GMT ratio 1.75; 97.5% CI 1.49 to 2.04).

Among previously infected participants GMTs were higher after the bivalent than the monovalent booster against both wild-type and Omicron strains (GMT ratios 1.27 [95% CI 1.07 to 1.51] and 1.90 [95% CI 1.50 to 2.40] respectively). The percentage of participants who produced antibodies against the wild-type and Omicron strains was 100% in both groups. Relative to the monovalent booster the bivalent version also triggered higher spike-binding antibody responses against all tested variants.

Previously infected participants had greater mean GMCs against the Omicron subvariants after the bivalent than after the monovalent booster (2337.4 [95% CI 1825.5 to 2992.9] vs 1270.8 [95% CI 987.3 to 1635.8]) as did all participants regardless of previous infection status (940.6 [95% CI 826.3 to 1070.6] vs 645.4 [95% CI 570.1 to 730.6]; GMT ratios 1.60 [95% CI 1.34 to 1.91] and 1.68 [95% CI 1.52 to 1.84]).

Similar safety profiles

The safety and reactogenicity of the two boosters were comparable and while the study didn't evaluate vaccine effectiveness an exploratory analysis showed that 11 participants (2.5%) in the bivalent group and 9 participants (2.4%) in the monovalent group tested positive for COVID-19.

Over median follow-ups of 43 days for the bivalent booster and 57 days for the monovalent version rates of adverse events within 7 days of vaccination were similar and most were mild or moderate. In both groups the most common local reaction was pain at the injection site while the most common systemic reactions were fatigue headache and muscle and joint pain.

A total of 18.5% of the bivalent group and 20.7% of the monovalent group experienced adverse events 28 days or more after the second booster. Of those 5.7% and 5.8% respectively were considered vaccine-related and none were severe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9uY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmVuZXctaG91c3Rvbi9oZWFsdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS9Ib3ctc2lkZS1lZmZlY3RzLWZyb20tdGhlLW5ldy1DT1ZJRC1ib29zdGVycy1mb3ItMTc0NTIwMDEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Side effects from new COVID boosters similar to original shots,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.houstonchronicle.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /lifestyle/renew-houston/health/article/How-side-effects-from-the-new-COVID-boosters-for-17452001.php (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FB0B220>, 'Connection to www.houstonchronicle.com timed out.

But unlike years past — when a majority of social-distancing protocols and closures were still in place — people are vaxxed socializing and gathering indoors more often.

That means in addition to potentially spreading COVID good ol' cold and flu germs can spread like wildfire too. While it feels unfair you can totally still get sick with a run-of-the-mill cold during this ongoing global pandemic.

And if you've been feeling sniffly or under the weather — and are due for your COVID booster shot — you might be wondering whether it's a good idea to get a booster if you have a cold or if you should wait until you're feeling better. So can you get your COVID booster with a cold or should you hold off? Here's the official recommendation.

COVID Booster Shot 101

First off make sure you're eligible for a COVID vaccine booster. All people ages 12+ are eligible to receive an updated Pfizer or Moderna (bivalent) booster according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This applies to you if:

You received all primary series doses (either two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine) and previously received the original (monovalent) boosters.

It's been at least 2 months since you finished your initial mRNA vaccine series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) or your last booster.

It's been at least 2 months since you got your Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine or your last booster.

FYI you're allowed to mix and match vaccines according to the CDC. So even if you got Moderna for your first and second dose if your pharmacy or doctor only has doses of the Pfizer booster shot that's totally fine. In fact there's some evidence showing that mixing and matching different vaccines may offer increased protection against COVID-19 infection but more comprehensive research is still underway so you shouldn't necessarily seek out a different brand for your booster. Note: people ages 12 to 17 years can only receive the updated Pfizer bivalent booster according to the CDC.

If You're Sick and Want to Get a COVID Booster...

Before anything else you should rule out COVID-19 as the reason you're under the weather because ""if you have COVID-19 you should not be getting a booster while you're sick [with the coronavirus]"" says Vivek Cherian M.D. internal medicine physician at Amita Health. That's because you should be isolating if you're infected with COVID-19; the CDC specifically recommends quarantining yourself for five days after you first start to show symptoms. If you're sick — even with ""normal"" mild cold symptoms such as a runny nose and sore throat — there's still a possibility that it could be COVID-19. In fact the CDC's official list of potential COVID symptoms includes many typical cold symptoms (including headache fatigue sore throat and congestion or runny nose) and breakthrough infections (when a fully vaccinated person is infected with COVID) tend to present with mild symptoms. Your best bet: Get tested to make sure it's not the coronavirus.

""If you've ruled out COVID-19"" says Dr. Cherian ""you need to ask yourself: how sick are you?""

If it's not COVID and your symptoms are mild (such as congestion runny nose cough or sore throat) it's ok to go ahead and get your COVID booster shot. ""[If you] overall feel like yourself I'd recommend getting your booster"" says Dr. Cherian. However ""if you're feeling quite ill (i.e. having fevers body aches diarrhea etc.) it's best to hold off on getting a booster"" he says. Still not sure? Here's CDC's handy prevaccination checklist.

There's no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases adverse reactions according to the CDC but still ""you want your immune system to be able to respond to your vaccine/booster in the most effective way possible and you don't want to be too compromised while dealing with a bad cold"" says Dr. Cherian.

Purvi Parikh M.D. an immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network and a co-investigator with the COVID vaccine trials agrees. ""Theoretically you may not mount as good of an immune response if your immune system is fighting a cold as well as then processing the vaccine"" she says.

Not to mention you could have worse side effects from the booster says Dr. Parikh. The side effects of the COVID booster are similar to the side effects of the original vaccine doses and aren't all that different from cold symptoms; the most common COVID side effects are pain redness and swelling in the arm that got the shot as well as tiredness headache muscle pain chills fever and nausea according to the CDC. Translation: If you get your COVID booster while you're already sick you might feel doubly crappy.

And if you get jabbed it might take you even longer to get over your cold. ""It will prolong your underlying illness as your body will be under stress from fighting the infection and stress from the vaccine"" explains Dr. Parikh.

The TL;DR

""If you have a cold with mild symptoms go ahead and get your booster; however if you have a more severe cold I'd recommend putting it off until after you recover"" says Dr. Cherian. But when in doubt wait it out; Dr. Parikh recommends erring on the side of caution and waiting until you're feeling normal to get your booster.

And while you're at it remember to get your flu shot (it's never too late!). With COVID — and its variants — still circulating it's important to prevent any illness. You can even get your flu shot at the same time as your COVID booster shot if you want. Talk about a 2-for-1 deal.

Researchers conducted a systematic review to evaluate the demographic and clinical factors and outcomes associated with psoriasis after COVID-19 vaccination. They searched the PubMed Embase Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for relevant studies from inception to April 25 2022.

Eligible studies reported at least 1 patient who had new-onset psoriasis or a psoriasis flare following 1 or more doses of any COVID-19 vaccine.

A total of 7 studies assessed new-onset psoriasis 32 studies reported psoriasis flares and 4 studies reported new-onset psoriasis and psoriasis flares in the analysis. The new-onset group included 35 patients with an age range of 23 to 79 years. A majority of the participants presented with plaque psoriasis (17 patients) followed by guttate psoriasis (10 patients). The flare group included 279 patients with an age range of 20 to 84 years who mostly had plaque-type psoriasis.

In the new-onset group 14% of participants received the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine 6% received the Moderna vaccine and 6% received the AstraZeneca vaccine respectively although the vaccine type was not reported for a majority of patients. Vaccine dose was reported for 8 patients with 4 new-onset psoriasis cases occurring after patients received the second vaccine dose and 4 cases occurring after the first dose. Onset times ranged from 2 to 21 days after vaccination.

In the flare group most patients received mRNA vaccines (28%) with the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine (20%) reported more frequently than the Moderna vaccine (7%) followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (7%) and the Sinovac vaccine (1%). Flares most frequently occurred after the second vaccine dose (23%) followed by the first dose (7%) both the first and second doses (2%) and the third dose (1%). Onset times ranged from 1 day to 90 days.

Patients in the new-onset group were most commonly treated with topical agents including topical corticosteroids calcipotriol or emollients. Most participants had improvement or resolution after treatment with the time to improvement or resolution ranging from 7 days to 2 months.

In the flare group patients received a variety of therapies to control their underlying psoriasis including topical treatments. Most participants achieved improvement and resolution with treatment times ranging from 3 days to 2 months.

Among several limitations some of the studies were observational studies or included data from retrospective database collection that lacked detailed information. In addition severity assessments were only reported in a limited number of studies. Furthermore few studies reported whether patients continued to receive vaccine doses when psoriasis developed after the first dose and reactions to later vaccines were rarely reported.

“Psoriatic patients may require regular follow-up before and after COVID-19 vaccination” stated the study authors. “More investigations remain necessary to elucidate the association between COVID-19 vaccines and psoriasis and the underlying mechanisms that drive the development of psoriasis following vaccination.”

At the authorization meeting FDA officials announced the approval of these new boosters for emergency use based on data from eight mice in a Pfizer study. At the same time the FDA revoked authorization for the original monovalent boosters—meaning anyone subject to a booster or “up-to-date” mandate will have to take the bivalent booster which has no proven safety or efficacy data in human beings.

While the flu vaccine is also approved on a yearly basis without full trials the mRNA COVID vaccines do not share the flu shot’s decadeslong track record of observed safety. The population most likely to be mandated to take a bivalent booster consists largely of college students. The young men in this population are the exact demographic that face heightened safety concerns specifically around myocarditis as documented in multiple peer-reviewed studies. In fact during a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend the bivalent boosters the agency presented updated myocarditis data that confirmed the rates of myocarditis in young men were about 2-to-3.5 times higher (slide 35) than the agency had claimed last year (slide 13). Nevertheless the FDA and CDC moved to recommend the bivalent boosters for anyone over the age of 12 without human clinical trials.

This is just the latest episode in the FDA’s less-than-thorough approach to new COVID vaccine approvals. For example in May 2022 the FDA authorized monovalent Pfizer boosters for children ages 5-11 based on laboratory data that showed heightened antibody response levels in just 67 children.

During the opioid crisis the FDA famously failed to demand adequate research disregarded safety concerns and allowed Purdue Pharma to promote oxycodone for uses that were never borne out by testing. Later it was revealed that the agency had been plagued by ethical issues: When the FDA convened advisers to address mounting oxycodone safety concerns for instance five out of 10 of these advisers had received payments from Purdue and another three had received payments from other opioid manufacturers.

The continuation of unchecked conflicts of interest and several recent authorizations for uses of new medical products that are in many ways unproven demonstrate that the FDA is essentially unresponsive to public outrage culminating in the bizarre spectacle of the agency promoting bivalent boosters on social media through unsubstantiated claims of efficacy acting not as a neutral regulator but actively advertising on behalf of pharmaceutical companies with government purchase contracts. The FDA’s disregard for its congressional mandate is not unique to this moment—it is a symptom of its decadeslong transformation into an agency captured by the corporations it is tasked with regulating.

When Kelley Krohnert a mother and career IT expert from Georgia watched the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting held on June 17 2022 she noted a slide that listed COVID as the fourth-leading cause of death for children under 1 and the fifth-leading cause for children aged 1-4 in the United States. This same slide was originally used at the FDA’s June 15 Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting when FDA advisers voted to authorize vaccines for children under 5. Krohnert immediately recognized that the slide was citing a preprint by researchers in the United Kingdom. This preprint not only used death statistics that included deaths where COVID was not an underlying cause—it also compared a 26-month cumulative total for COVID deaths to a 12-month total for other deaths. In Krohnert’s analysis COVID fell to ninth place for children under 1 and into a four-way tie for eighth place for children aged 1-4. When the researchers corrected their preprint to adjust for some of the errors Krohnert found COVID fell below influenza and pneumonia as a cause of death for children under 5.

“I didn’t have to do a complex statistical analysis to find these errors” Krohnert told me. “If this is the standard for what goes into these presentations what kind of vetting is going into that data?”

This lack of vetting is a central issue in the FDA’s approval process. The key question for any drug authorization is “Do the benefits outweigh the risks?” When a disease’s risks are exaggerated one side of this equation is skewed and the equation is also affected by exaggerating the benefits of a treatment or ignoring the potential risks of that treatment. The data presented in recent FDA meetings has been consistently nonobjective and skewed to favor drug approval.

For the authorization of vaccines for children under 5 boosters for children 5-11 and the new bivalent boosters the FDA has relied heavily on measures of antibody levels as the main “benefit” side of the equation. This is despite the fact that Pfizer has admitted that there is “no established correlate of protection” between antibody levels and immunity. Both the CDC and the FDA already advise against the use of antibody testing to determine levels of immunity. Essentially this metric has been deemed inadequate by the very regulatory agency that is now consistently accepting it as a substitute for clinical trials.

This lack of real efficacy data has been accompanied by a disregard for potential safety issues. European Union regulators have already warned that frequent boosters can weaken the immune system; the FDA is apparently unconcerned. The FDA also disregarded the fact that for pediatric vaccines Pfizer observed a higher rate of severe COVID in its vaccine group (table 5). Furthermore the FDA allowed the company to ignore 365 symptomatic cases in its trial and to use only the last 10 symptomatic cases after the third dose to claim 80% efficacy (tables 19 and 20). This is significant because Pfizer saw negative efficacy between doses 1 and 2. In a vaccine meant to prevent illness for an age group that is already at extremely low risk this data should have been a red flag for the FDA. Why then has the body charged with protecting Americans from inadequately tested products been so eager not just to authorize these products for emergency use but to enthusiastically recommend them?

Dr. Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia was one of only two advisers who voted against VRBPAC’s recommendation for reformulated boosters in June. I asked him about his vote as an FDA vaccine adviser and longtime advocate for vaccination. He told me he believed the thinking behind the bivalent boosters was sound. “The problem for me” he said “was I just didn’t think the data that were presented on June 28th to our committee made that case compellingly.”

I asked Offit if he felt there was political pressure to vote a certain way. “I never feel pressure when I cast my vote” he answered. “I voted no.” However he said “I think the way that they were presented I think it was clear that the FDA and the World Health Organization wanted to go in this direction.” It was notable that the day after the FDA’s vote the White House announced its purchase of 171 million bivalent booster doses from Pfizer and Moderna for $4.9 billion. “You felt that the train sort of had left the station” Offit said.

In 2020 the Trump administration was widely criticized for rushing vaccines and pressuring the FDA. Although the Biden administration has exerted similar if not more pressure it has enjoyed a conspicuous absence of criticism. Before the FDA’s expert panel could even meet to discuss vaccines for children under 5 for example the White House’s COVID czar Ashish Jha publicly announced a precise date for when they would become available. In other words Jha appeared to know the FDA’s decision before it had allegedly made one.

Notably President Joe Biden’s election campaign reversed a long-standing trend of Republican candidates receiving far more campaign donations from the pharmaceutical industry: In 2020 Biden outraised Trump from Big Pharma by a margin of 2 to 1. Several political appointees in the Biden administration moreover have ties to vaccine manufacturers including the president’s chief campaign strategist Anita Dunn who worked for Pfizer before joining his team. Biden also ran his election campaign on the promise to “shut down the virus”; it turned out that there were more U.S. COVID deaths in 2021 when vaccines were widely available than in 2020 when they were not. Rather than reckon with this fact and readjust its strategy the administration has doubled down by putting increased political pressure on an already compromised FDA.

The public comment section of the June 15 2022 VRBPAC meeting featured several anxious parents who described keeping their infants and toddlers under extreme conditions of isolation over two years after the the beginning of the pandemic. Many FDA panelists argued that in light of these comments it was necessary to authorize the vaccines so that these parents could finally allow their infants and toddlers to experience normal life.

“That’s just not an acceptable basis for drug or vaccine authorization” Dr. Vinay Prasad professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco told me. The purpose of the FDA as a federal regulatory agency is not to simply give people choices or even to address consumer anxiety as such. The FDA’s focus on parents’ desires as a rationale for approval is particularly significant given that just 5% of children under 5 ended up getting the first dose. Clearly the demand has not been overwhelming. If we wanted unlimited options Prasad explained we wouldn’t have an FDA at all. “You can just have a free market where you can have whatever choice you want” he said. The purpose of the FDA by contrast is “to shield us from making very very bad choices.”

The FDA used to have solid credibility on safety and efficacy but in Prasad’s view “over the last 15 or 20 years in many sectors of the FDA I think there’s been an erosion in fundamental values and an increase in favoritism toward corporate interests.” Pharmaceutical companies have been allowed to provide funding for the FDA since 1992; today a full 75% of the FDA’s scientific review budget comes directly from the industry. There is also the problem of the FDA’s revolving door. In 2016 Prasad conducted a review of the future jobs of cancer and hematology regulators and found that 57% of those who left the FDA went on to work for the industry. This “is sort of a terribly perverse incentive” Prasad explained. “If your primary job occupation is to work for the firm across the table how can you be an effective regulator?”

Currently some of the FDA advisers who have served on VRBPAC panels have potential conflicts of interest. Dr. James Hildreth for example is president and CEO of Meharry Medical College which served as a site for Moderna’s vaccine trial and which was set to receive between $1.5 million and $2 million from the pharmaceutical giant. He was granted a waiver to be a voting member on VRBPAC anyway.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services make public any funding that doctors receive from the biopharmaceutical industry. According to this database Dr. Arnold Monto the acting chair of VRBPAC received a total of $161350 in payments from pharmaceutical companies between 2015 and 2021. This includes consulting fees from Pfizer Seqirus (a company that plans to use mRNA technology to develop new influenza vaccines) and Hoffmann-La Roche (the company that provided antibody tests for Moderna’s vaccine trials). Dr. Archana Chatterjee a member of VRBPAC received $456657 in payments and research funding from pharmaceutical companies between 2015 and 2021. This includes $131657 in payments and research funding from Pfizer which the FDA apparently did not consider a potential conflict of interest.

Since 2015 at least seven other voting FDA advisers have received thousands (and sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands) of dollars from pharmaceutical companies in the form of consulting fees and research funding. Of these Dr. Ofer Levy Dr. Wayne Marasco Dr. Steven Pergam and Dr. Jay Portnoy received payments from companies involved in mRNA technology. These companies include Shire Amgen Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. The fact that some advisers received funding from companies that have previous or new investments in mRNA is made more troubling by the fact that Levy cited the general use of mRNA as a reason to approve pediatric vaccines on June 15. “There’s a broader context” he said. “This mRNA vaccine platform may be useful not just against this current coronavirus and its current variants but the next one as well as future pandemics.” In total of the 21 members at the June 15 meeting (who voted unanimously to recommend vaccines for children under 5) at least 10 had received some form of direct or indirect payment from the biopharmaceutical industry.

These kinds of relationships are not outside the norm. To this day we don’t know what if any financial incentives were involved in the selection process for companies that received research funding through Operation Warp Speed. This is because Donald Trump’s vaccine chief Moncef Slaoui accepted a $1 government contractor fee which legally allowed him to avoid disclosing his full stock portfolio. Moreover one of the main architects of Operation Warp Speed was the FDA’s lead vaccine regulator Dr. Peter Marks. A Star Trek fan Marks was the man who gave Operation Warp Speed its name. According to Dr. Janet Woodcock the former interim head of the FDA “The U.S. response to the pandemic as far as vaccines … was largely [Dr. Mark’s] concept.” Originally Marks recused himself from a regulatory position but regained his role once he left Operation Warp Speed shortly after the program began.

Regardless of the ultimate successes or failures of Operation Warp Speed itself this raises a fundamental ethical question about how the American government works. If a regulator is personally invested in the success of drug development can he or she be objective in making regulatory decisions for ordinary people? This question is all the more relevant given the fact that COVID vaccines are some of the most lucrative pharmaceutical products in history.

In 2021 Pfizer’s COVID vaccine sales topped $36 billion and Moderna’s reached $17.7 billion. In 2022 these companies are forecast to reach a combined $51 billion in COVID vaccine sales. It is of course in the interests of Pfizer and Moderna to seek to maximize profits by bypassing clinical trials. This is how we would expect these companies to behave. It is the role of the FDA however to ensure that any product on the market is effective and safe.

As we learned during the opioid epidemic a breakdown in the decision-making process at the FDA can have a profound impact on society as a whole. To watch the FDA actively promote a fifth COVID shot for Americans while almost every other country on Earth moves in the opposite direction is to notice that something fundamental remains broken at the agency.

Jim Mooney spent $96000 between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 to hold onto his House District 120 seat representing the Florida Keys and the southernmost part of Miami-Dade County.

More than 84% of the money covered advertising.

Mooney also raised $51000 between his campaign account and political committee Friends of Jim Mooney with disproportionate help from health care and utility companies.

His largest expenditure was a more than $68000 payment to Los Angeles-based campaign advertising company Mentzer Media Services. Another $10000 went to Orlando-based Consensus Media. He also paid $2800 to Keys Weekly the largest newspaper circulation in Monroe County.

The rest went to campaign upkeep costs staff reimbursements signage and financial consulting.

The Republican Party of Florida and its House-specific fundraising and spending apparatus has given Mooney $63500 worth of in-kind help since Aug. 1. His campaign earmarked the assistance as going toward campaign staff and telephone call costs.

Health care organizations giving Mooney $1000 apiece included the Florida Medical Association Dade County Medical Association Molina Healthcare Inc. Health Network One Inc. and Fort Lauderdale-based American Therapy Administrators.

Mooney also took $1000 donations from Duke Energy Corp. Underground Utility Contractor and the Florida Public Utilities Co.

Other donations included $2500 from NBCUniversal Media $2000 from Charter Schools USA and $1000 from American Airlines.

Since winning state office in November 2020 Mooney has raised more than $364000. He had less than $50000 remaining by Sept. 9.

His opponent Democratic lawyer Adam Gentle has raised roughly $124000 since filing to run for office in January. Of that he had $17000 left between his campaign account and political committee Adam for Democracy.

Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 Gentle spent more than $35000. More than 80% of it went to advertising.

He paid Coral Gables-based Blue Velocity Consulting $28400 for campaign mailers. He spent $3000 on digital ads from Washington-headquartered Compete Digital and another $600 on text messaging services from The Sexton Group in Chicago.

The remainder of his spending covered merchant fees and accounting services.

Gentle also added more than $21000 to his campaign coffers all of it through personal checks. Most were for less than $100.

HD 120 spans all of Monroe County which encompasses all of Monroe County and most of Everglades National Park and the southernmost portion of Miami-Dade County including parts of Homestead Homestead Air Reserve Base and Biscayne National Park.

Last month Mooney defeated Republican Primary challenger Rhonda Rebman Lopez by just 90 votes a 0.8% margin of victory.

Gentle meanwhile defeated former congressional Chief of Staff Dan Horton-Diaz in the Democratic Primary with 55.6% of the vote.

Sources confirmed to IndyStar on Monday IU Athletics plans to introduce beer sales to the general public at men’s and women’s basketball games this coming season for the first time. Previously alcohol was only served in select locations in the arena primarily areas accessed only by small groups of donors or university officials.

IndyStar confirmed sales will begin with Hoosier Hysteria on Oct. 7. The department later announced the move officially via a news release.

“We continue to receive very positive feedback about our decision to introduce this option at a number of our other home sporting events which makes this decision a logical next step in our ongoing efforts to improve the experience for our passionate Hoosier fans” athletic director Scott Dolson said in the release. “As we have done at our other venues we will be diligent about promoting encouraging and supporting responsible behavior at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall beginning with Hoosier Hysteria.”

The expansion follows what Indiana has repeatedly described as successful rollouts of beer and/or wine sales at a number of other athletics events including football baseball softball and soccer games.

Insider:Why IU's schedule is the biggest threat to its Big Ten title hopes

More:With new official beer sponsors IU keeps expanding alcohol sales. Is Assembly Hall next?

Previously the department had ruled out sales at Assembly Hall due to concerns about crowd proximity to the floor. But the success of introductions without significant incident in other venues prompted a rethink in recent months with Dolson confirming earlier this semester that his department was examining further expansion of alcohol sales.

""Data really shows from the time we implemented it the first year at Memorial Stadium that our incidents actually went down"" Dolson told reporters late last month. ""I think controlling the environment has proved to be successful.”

Plans call for sales to end with 10 minutes remaining in the second half of men’s games and at the end of the third quarter of women’s games. A source confirmed only beer will be offered at this time. Indiana's release underscored that ""no beer will be sold to a visibly intoxicated person"" and that all vendors selling beer will have a current server's permit.

IU Athletics recently announced Molson Coors Beverage Company and local brewery Upland Brewing Company as the department’s domestic and craft beer sponsors respectively. It's likely IU fans can expect similar offerings at Assembly Hall to what's already available at other venues: a mix of domestic options and Upland staples.

The GCP was cut because of weaker-than-expected performance at City Brewing and Pabst was lowered because its rating is subject to a cap of one notch under its GCP’s rating. Pabst’s secured debt rating was also reduced to B- from B.

S&P Global said it considers Pabst’s capital structure to be unsustainable unless cash flow improves. The agency said operating performance is “slightly behind our expectations” projecting break-even free operating cash flow (FOCF) this year and around $10 million positive FOCF in 2023 which is insufficient to support the company’s amortization requirements.

Along those lines the agency considers Pabst’s liquidity as “less than adequate” because of the weak cash flow. S&P Global offered as a liquidity option that Pabst sell its Irwindale Calif. property noting that the property was acquired in 2020 from Molson Coors Beverage company and Pabst has said it intends to sell it.

Pabst is a brewer whose products include its flagship Pabst Blue Ribbon brand Old Milwaukee Colt 45 Schlitz Stroh’s and others.

Mikaela ...,"Monday September 19 2022

What attracted you to joining Mondelēz?

To me Mondelēz represents a strong set of company values and principles in association with being named as one of the largest snacking companies in the world.

I started here at MDLZ in the incredible graduate scientist program and a year later am now very lucky to be a permanent Scientist in the R&D Product Team in Ringwood. My one-year journey at MDLZ has given me the opportunity to gain industry experience straight out of university.

Mondelēz offer an array of areas to grow and develop with a collaborative inclusive and flexible work culture. The company’s strong drivers for change across sustainability and wellbeing create a positive environment to continue my career.

What has been the highlight/s (projects) for you at Mondelēz?

A highlight for me is creating and formulating recipes in the Pilot Plant and taking these through to factory trials and then to commissioning. Seeing a product come to life from the developing stage is very exciting.

What do you think people can expect from a career with Mondelēz?

Upon commencing a career with MDLZ the endless opportunities and knowledgeable colleagues make for a rich environment to learn and grow in as an individual.

What is unique about working in Research & Development?

Working in the R&D Product team enables me to work in the Pilot Plant during the recipe development stage experiencing firsthand the chocolate product that will come to life.

During this time shelf-life studies and sensory testing are also initiated and this ultimately determines the finished technical properties of a product. From this specifications are created or edited solely by the R&D Team.

As R&D Product work very closely with the formulation of the product the customer is always at the centre of every decision made. R&D aim to provide the desired customer experience with the most relevant technologies.

R&D are able to focus on the science and build technical skills through the support of technical projects and implementation surrounding chocolate.

What does flexibility mean for you at Mondelēz?

Flexibility at MDLZ allows for a productive and efficient work schedule. The new work from home option paired with office collaboration and lab work provides for a greater work life balance.

What does career development and learning mean for you at Mondelēz?

Industry development and learning is very fundamental to me after recently graduating from university as this initial development and ways of working is the foundation of my career journey. After celebrating one year at MDLZ I have learnt so much and am excited to see where another few years will lead me.

How would you describe the working culture at Mondelēz?

The Mondelez work culture represents a diverse and inclusive team. The comfortable and positive environment makes it engaging to collaborate and innovate with all colleagues across the business. The company creates many workshops and opportunities to build relationships which would otherwise be quite hard in such a large international company. Due to this inclusivity within MDLZ a strong sense of connectedness is achieved.

What does Health & Wellbeing mean for you at Mondelēz?

Health and Wellbeing is continuing to accelerate at a fast pace at Mondelēz. With emphasis and focus on mental health during the pandemic and working from home. The introduction of the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Pillars builds importance on employee wellbeing and highlights that health comes first.

What advice do you have for someone considering an opportunity with Mondelēz?

My only advice is to definitely take an opportunity presented by MDLZ! Mondelēz cover so many vital areas not only focusing on sustainability and wellbeing encompassing the future of snacking but more specifically on each individual employee. The positive and supportive environment allows for a greater growth in career development.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The court deemed that it could take unfair advantage of the famous energy drink brand’s trade mark ‘RED BULL’. The case (Monster Energy Company v Red Bull GmbH [2022] EWHC 2155 (Ch)) was initially held before the UKIPO before Monster Energy’s appeal to the High Court.

The Trade Mark

In 2020 Monster Energy filed an application to register a UK trade mark for ‘RED DAWG’ in respect of non-alcoholic beverages. Its rival Red Bull opposed the application on the basis of likelihood of confusion amongst members of the public – a common ground for opposition by the owner of an earlier mark.

The UKIPO Decision

At the first instance hearing the UKIPO found that with regard to the likelihood of confusion objection argued by Red Bull that there would be no confusion between the marks in the eyes of consumers even on identical goods i.e. energy drinks. The UKIPO therefore rejected Red Bull’s opposition.

However the UKIPO did note that the ‘RED DAWG’ mark would likely appear familiar to consumers and lead them to associate the mark with Red Bull goods. In turn allowing Monster Energy to establish its trade mark without incurring the marketing and advertising costs that would otherwise be free-riding off of the goodwill established by the earlier Red Bull mark. The UKIPO therefore upheld Red Bull’s opposition on the grounds of unfair advantage.

The Appeal

In its appeal to the High Court Monster Energy argued that there was no evidence to support the UKIPO’s conclusion that there was a potential for ‘free riding’ by ‘RED DAWG’ on the ‘RED BULL’ mark or from which a risk of ‘free riding’ could be inferred. Monster Energy submitted that it was not sufficient that the owner of the ‘RED BULL’ mark could benefit from an advantage there must also be a link which makes the advantage unfair.

The UKIPO had already expressly rejected the submission that Monster Energy had any intention to deceive or cause confusion to the consumers. Further advantage or unfairness cannot be simply assumed but instead has to be proven by way of evidence and the UKIPO did not engage in any evidential analysis when arriving at its decision. Monster Energy effectively argued the High Court needed to find the higher threshold of wrongful intent in Monster Energy’s application for the mark to find unfair advantage.

In reply Red Bull argued that there is no requirement to show the subjective intention of taking advantage of an earlier mark. They argued that a conclusion of unfair advantage can be drawn in circumstances where the use of a sign has the objective effect of creating such advantage. Red Bull also submitted that the UKIPO had arrived at its decision by drawing rational conclusions.

The High Court was not convinced by arguments put forward by Monster Energy. In particular it determined that Monster Energy had chosen to use the ‘RED DAWG’ mark so that it would have commercial significance amongst its energy drink competitors and an impact on the consumers of energy drink products. The High Court reasoned that when encountering ‘RED DAWG’ products consumers would be reminded of the earlier ‘RED BULL’ mark even if they would not necessarily be confused between them. This would mean that Monster Energy would be able to establish and sell their energy drinks more easily without the necessary marketing expenditure. Therefore even if Monster Energy did not have a subjective intention to take unfair advantage of its rival’s mark ‘RED DAWG’ would be given a ‘free-ride’ and gain an unfair commercial advantage.

Furthermore the High Court also considered the issue of legal principle of ‘unfair advantage’ and its interpretation by the UKIPO. It noted that the analysis and application of the law was clear and correct. On the argument of the lack of evidence underpinning the UKIPO’s decision as made by Monster Energy the High Court found that it is entirely permissible to draw inferences based on the inherent probabilities and this will not be treated as speculation. It is often the case that there are competing factors in a case evaluation with some factors pointing in the other direction but that does not suggest that the overall decision is incorrect. As such the High Court was not satisfied that the UKIPO decision was clearly wrong and therefore it was not open for challenge.

No Free Rides for Trade Marks?

The decision reiterates that the interpretation of unfair advantage is objective. This means that owners of established brands are able to protect themselves from any free-riders looking to register new marks without needing to prove their actual subjective intent to benefit from an earlier mark.

Furthermore the case once again highlights that the UK courts are reluctant to interfere with decisions made by the UKIPO as the threshold for doing so is high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvbW9uc3Rlci1tZW510gEzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJlbmRodW50ZXIuY29tL2FtcC90cmVuZHMvbW9uc3Rlci1tZW51?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Halloween-Themed Kid's Menus,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvbW9uc3Rlci1tZW510gEzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJlbmRodW50ZXIuY29tL2FtcC90cmVuZHMvbW9uc3Rlci1tZW51?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FE9DCF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As a gamer you know there’s nothing more “on brand” than people chugging energy drinks to be awake for their gaming sessions. While there’s several companies out there that make supplements and energy drinks specifically aimed at gamers Ghost Energy strives to be a standout by providing gamers with clean energy drinks that aren’t full of sugar and other seemingly bad chemicals while offering up some great candy inspired flavors increasing your enjoyment and your energy level at the same time. Recently the folks at Ghost Lifestyle reached out and sent us a sampler pack to check out so without further delay here’s my review of the Ghost brand energy drinks.

Ghost Energy

Manufacturer: Ghost Lifestyle

MSRP: Sample Case – $32.99 Gamer Powder Tub – $39.99

Ghost sent over a 12 can sampler pack that features two cans ranging from six different flavors and a tub of their Gamer supplement in Sour Patch Kids Pineapple flavor. Let’s start off with the Gamer powder as the drink mixes are their core product.

The Gamer supplement differs from the Energy supplement as each scoop contains the following ingredients:

800MG nooLVL®

500MG L-Tyrosine

250MG Cognizin® Citicoline

75MG Natural Caffeine

AstraGin®

nooLVL is a specially blended supplement which helps gamers focus quickly and encourages faster reaction time L-Tyrosine also encourages better focus and mood improvement Cognizin improves focus and AstraGin helps the body absorb these supplements better. I’ve been using these products for a few weeks now and can honestly say that I do notice a bit less brain fog while under the effects of the Gamer supplement. This has been a nice and delicious alternative to my morning coffee on days where I really could use the extra attention span in the first half of the day. The Pineapple flavor is just tart enough to remind you of the actual candy while sweet enough to make you enjoy every single sip. If you like Pineapple this stuff is delicious.

Moving onto the Energy can samples Ghost sent over a 12 can sample case that had two cans of each of the following flavors: Tropical Mango Citrus Sour Patch Kids Redberry Sour Patch Kids Blue Raspberry Swedish Fish and Warheads Watermelon. The energy drinks differ from the Gamer supplement as they contain the following:

200mg Natural Caffeine

1000mg Carnipure® L-Carnitine

150mg Alpha-GPC

100mg NeuroFactor™

25mg AstraGin®

L-Carnitine is a thermogenic that helps you use burned stored fat for energy so it’s pretty easy to see why it’s included here. NeuroFactor works to boost brain activity and cognitive increase while Alpha GPC works to increase focus and just like the Gamer tub AstraGin helps it all absorb easier. I don’t know that I got as much focus improvement out of the Energy drinks but they certainly wake you up and get the blood flowing better than the Gamer supplement. In fact I’d almost consider these Energy drinks a pre-workout if they had a little bit of pump in them. But what about the flavors?

The Warheads flavored Watermelon is scary as to how close the candy it actually tastes it’s like if someone took 10 of them and threw them in a glass of carbonated water for 20 minutes and then you drank them. It’s uncanny but almost too overpowering and made my stomach hurt a bit if I drank it too quickly. It’s still very tasty but I found myself having to sip on those due to the overwhelming sour kick.

Next up I tried the Citrus and it’s perfect for what it is. It’s got a nice sort of a Sprite taste to it that tastes great. Tropical Mango is very much in the same vein where it’s got a nice pleasant flavor that isn’t too strong or tastes super fake.

I’ll be 100% honest here I don’t care for the taste of Swedish Fish so I took a sip of one and while it’s not nearly as gross as eating that awful wax flavored candy it still wasn’t really my thing so I gave them to my step kid who loved them.

Finally I gave the two Sour Patch Kids flavors a shot since the Pineapple powder was so good. Redberry is awesome easily my favorite of the candy themed flavors out of the sampler pack and certainly a flavor I would consider ordering in a 12 pack. The Blue Raspberry is also pretty good but I’m not a big fan of Raspberry in general so I can only say that I “liked” it at best.

For the cost Ghost Lifestyle offers supplements that are right on par with some of the better known “gamer energy” drinks and they’re equal if not higher in quality based on their attention to detail in their embossed packaging as to where others just have a standard label Ghost’s tubs and cans have cool little textures that add a slight bit of an extra pop.

I also really like their little ghost mascot so for me it’s easy to recommend Ghost over their competition based on having a fantastic product with even cooler packaging and merch – but I’m also aware that their packaging comes with a premium price. While the Energy cans are fairly affordable – in fact slightly after I got this pack I saw single cans available on sale at Kroger 10 for $10 (normally $2.59 each) which is considerably easier on the wallet than ordering a pack for $30. Counterbalancing that the tub states that it has 40 servings but since the “advanced” serving is two scoops there’s actually only 20 in the tub which makes their Gamer supplement far more expensive than I’d like it to be. This makes a tub essentially $40 for 20 servings – or two dollars per 16-20oz drink and while that’s better for you both financially and physically than say a $3.29 can of Monster it can get quite pricey if you drink more than one drink per day.

Ghost Energy and the Gamer supplement are available for purchase from Ghost Lifestyle Amazon or other retailers. Ghost Lifestyle provided Niche Gamer with samples of their product for the purposes of this review.",,,,,,
MCO,Moody's Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9ob3VzaW5nLW1hcmtldC1kb3dudHVybi1tb3Zlcy1pbnRvLXNlY29uZC1zdGFnZS1mYWxsaW5nLWhvbWUtcHJpY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We're entering the next stage of the housing market downturn—3 things to expect heading forward,"Back in June Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: The housing market would go through a “reset.”

“I’d say if you are a homebuyer somebody or a young person looking to buy a home you need a bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again” Powell told reporters.

Whenever a central bank moves from monetary easing to monetary tightening there’s going to be an impact on a rate-sensitive sector like real estate. That impact of course is going to be even greater when monetary tightening comes after the asset class—residential real estate—spiked 43% in just over two years. Powell admitted that much in June. However Powell was noncommittal as to whether the rate shock would push home prices lower.

Fast forward to September and we no longer need to question if the housing “reset” will affect home prices. Back in June the U.S. housing market was still just in the early innings of a sharp drop in housing activity. Since we’ve seen housing activity including home sales and home construction levels go much lower. But as data rolls in for August we now have clear evidence that the housing market downturn has moved beyond that first stage (i.e. a sharp drop in housing activity) and into the second stage (i.e. falling home prices).

“The longer that [mortgage] rates stay elevated our view is that housing is going to continue to feel it and have this reset mode. And the affordability resetting mechanism right now that has to happen is on [home] prices. And so there are a lot of markets across the country where we’re forecasting that home prices are going to fall double-digits” Rick Palacios Jr. head of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting tells Fortune.

Let’s take a deeper look at the three elements that’ll shift as we move into the second stage of the housing market downturn.

1. The home price correction is spreading.

As mortgage rates spiked—going from 3.2% to 6.3% this year—industry insiders knew it'd cause a sharp contraction in housing activity. However many housing bulls thought it wouldn't pull prices down. In March Zillow went as far as to predict another 17.8% jump in home prices over the coming year.

It's clear that housing bulls got it wrong. Among the 148 regional housing markets tracked by John Burns Real Estate Consulting 98 housing markets have seen home values fall from their 2022 peaks. Just 50 markets remains at their peak.

In 11 markets the Burns Home Value Index* has already dropped by more than 5%. That includes a 8.2% drop in San Francisco home values. While it's common for median list prices to drop around this time of year it's not common for home values or ""comps"" to fall because of seasonality. Simply put: The home price correction is sharper—and more widespread—than previously thought.

A growing chorus of research firms—including Moody's Analytics John Burns Real Estate Consulting Zonda and Zelman & Associates—expect this home price correction to continue into 2023. Peak-to-trough Moody's Analytics thinks U.S. home prices could soon fall 5%. In significantly ""overvalued"" housing markets Moody's Analytics thinks that price drop could range from 5% to 10%. If a recession manifests Moody's Analytics predicts those price drops would double. But even that scenario would still be below the peak-to-trough U.S. home price decline of 27% we saw between 2006 and 2012.

There are still some firms that don't think the home price correction—which is driven by an affordability squeeze created by spiked mortgage rates—will carry over into 2023. That includes Zillow. The Seattle-based home listing site acknowledges that 62% of housing markets should see falling home values in the third quarter of 2022. However Zillow economists predict that only 28.5% of markets are headed for year-over-year declines between August 2022 and August 2023.

2. The housing downturn will soon spread beyond housing.

On a year-over-year basis the ongoing housing downturn has seen new home sales and existing home sales fall by 29.6% and 20.2%. Real estate firms like Redfin Realtor.com and Compass have already issued layoffs. Homebuilders are calling off projects while some mortgage lenders are teetering on bankruptcy.

That said most of the financial pain of the housing downturn has been contained within the real estate industry. That's about to change.

Researchers at Goldman Sachs recently released a paper titled “The Housing Downturn: Further to Fall.” The investment bank forecasts that U.S. housing GDP will drop by 8.9% in 2022 and another 9.2% in 2023. In the lead-up to the Great Recession—which officially started in December 2007—housing GDP fell by 7.4% in 2006 and 21.4% in 2007.

If Goldman Sachs is right it'll mean the contractions in the U.S. housing market will soon sprawl out into the broader economy. That's not surprising. After all the Federal Reserve has upped the Federal Funds rate in an attempt to slow the economy.

As home shoppers across the country put their home search on pause it causes homebuilders to pull back. That sees decreased demand for things like refrigerators lumber windows and paint. Those economic contractions should in theory help to rein in runaway inflation.

""It [housing] is not the target but it [housing] is essentially the target"" Bill McBride author of the economics blog Calculated Risk told Fortune earlier this summer.

3. Sellers are calling timeout.

As the Pandemic Housing Boom fizzled out this summer we saw inventory jump across the country. In bubbly markets like Austin and Boise that inventory jump was greater than 300% between March and August.

But that inventory spike is already fizzling out.

Active listings on Realtor.com jumped by 106900 homes in May. That was followed by 102900 and 128200 jumps in June and July. However that slowed in August to just a 31900 inventory jump. And through the rest of the year Altos Research predicts inventory will actually fall.

What's going on? For starters sellers are realizing that buyers are done paying top dollar. Rather than take less some sellers are simply waiting out the housing downturn.

There's also the rate lock-in effect. The vast majority of outstanding mortgages have rates below 5%—with a big chunk even below 3%. If they sell now they'd be giving up their historically low mortgage rate. That payment jump is hardly appealing for move-up buyers.

""It's going to be very very hard to persuade people to let go of those insanely low rates"" Palacios tells Fortune. While many industry insiders believe tight inventory will help to prevent a housing crash Palacios says it won't be enough to prevent the home price correction.

Crews arrived to find fire in the third-floor apartment and everyone evacuated.

Crews worked to stop the water and clear the smoke from the building. The building contains 60 apartments on the upper three floors and houses a Mosaic Medical Clinic on the ground floor. There was water damage found in the clinic as well but shouldn’t keep the business from opening for regular business on Monday. Damages are estimated at $50000.

Due to the water and smoke damage five apartments have been displaced until the clean up can be completed. Red Cross arrived and were helping the six occupants find hotel rooms for the night. All other occupants were able to safely return to their apartments. The fire sprinkler and alarm systems were restored to ensure the building was safe for occupancy after the incident. Restoration company is on scene to start the clean up process.

The fire sprinkler system stopped the fire quickly and helped keep the damage to a minimum. With the fire stopped before it could spread out of the kitchen the amount of smoke in the building was kept to a minimum and allowed the occupants to evacuated safely.

Bend Fire Department reminds everyone to keep a watchful eye on anything you’re cooking. Cooking fires are leading cause of home fires in the country.

If You Have a Cooking Fire:

Get out and Stay out! When you leave close the door behind you to help contain the fire. Turn off the stove and oven when you leave if you can do it safely.

Ensure everyone else in the home is evacuating as well.

Call 911 immediately.

If you try to fight the fire be sure others are getting out and calling 911 for you. Ensure you have a clear way out too.

Keep a lid nearby when you’re cooking to smother small grease fires. Smother the fire by sliding the lid over the pan and turn off the stove top. Leave the pan covered until it’s completely cooled!

For an oven fire turn off the heat and keep the door closed.

A building-block approach can be the basis for investors who want to meet their targets on climate footprints and green revenues.

In a simulation we show that a gradual shift of capital from market to climate portfolios could result in a 71% reduction in the total portfolio’s carbon footprint with a tracking error of 95 basis points.

Asset owners who want to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5°C) have a tough row to hoe. In the short term the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) says they would need to reduce absolute emissions between 22% and 32% from 2020 to 2025 by lowering their financed emissions and increasing their allocations to green-tech companies. In the medium term the emissions reduction ranges between 49% and 65% over the 2020 base year.1

The challenge for asset owners is figuring out how to build multi-asset-class portfolios that follow these predefined target pathways while keeping their portfolios broad and diversified and minimizing risk against a standard market benchmark.

In general asset owners may pursue one of two approaches for constructing net-zero portfolios or a combination of the two approaches. They could shift capital from high to low emitters over time to achieve decarbonization or they could reallocate capital toward companies that have ambitious emissions-reduction targets and a strong track record of achieving them. In this blog post we explore the first approach using MSCI Climate Indexes as proxies for climate portfolios. Although we use a building-block approach that includes both market- and climate-based methodologies in theory one could combine these approaches in a single portfolio to achieve similar outcomes.

A building-block approach

We deployed the MSCI Climate Change and Paris Aligned Indexes as building blocks for both equity and fixed income. Both index methodologies implicitly or explicitly 1) target lower carbon intensity/carbon emissions than the market 2) have higher weightings in green-revenue companies and 3) have self-decarbonization objectives.2 Historically these methodologies have resulted in diversified indexes with low to moderate levels of tracking error from the parent (market-cap) indexes.

Building smooth transition pathways

We looked at two examples of asset owners that currently hold a 60/40 equity/fixed income portfolio: We used the MSCI ACWI Index as a proxy for global equities and a combination of MSCI corporate-bond indexes for global bonds.3 We assumed they have set the following short- and medium-term targets for carbon footprints and green-revenue exposure with Investor B being more ambitious than Investor A.

Investor targets

2025 2030 Investor A Net decarbonization 25% 50% Green-revenue ratio 1.2X 1.5X Investor B Net-decarbonization 35% 70% Green-revenue ratio 1.4X 1.8X

Next we simulated pathways for both investors assuming they gradually shift their allocations from market-cap approaches to climate-based methodologies using indexes as proxies. The pathways were defined by 2025 and 2030 targets (in line with NZAOA recommendations) using interim target levels between these dates. The 60/40 equity/bond mix was kept constant. We assumed that the market indexes don’t decarbonize while the MSCI Climate Change and Climate Paris Aligned Indexes self-decarbonize at a rate of 7% and 10% respectively.4 We used MSCI Climate Change Indexes for Investor A and Climate Paris Aligned Indexes for Investor B as a proxy for climate allocations. For Investor B the pathway resulted in a capital move of 16.7% per year from market to climate allocations until 2025 and a 6.9% annual shift from 2025 till 2030. For Investor A these numbers were marginally lower.

Simulated capital allocation over time using MSCI equity and bond indexes as proxies

For both investors the hypothetical portfolios (resulting from simulated pathways) would have achieved their respective climate targets.5 By 2030 Investor A would have reduced the carbon footprint of the portfolio by 52% and Investor B by 71%. Since the two MSCI climate indexes also target higher exposure to companies with green revenues their green-revenue targets were also met under the assumption that index-level green revenues don’t change over time. Investor B would have met the more ambitious climate targets by selecting a faster-decarbonizing climate index and by adopting a more aggressive capital shift from broad-market to climate portfolios.

Simulated path of carbon footprint and exposure to green revenues

The equity allocation’s carbon footprint is calculated using WACI and the fixed-income allocation using carbon emissions (metric tons of CO2). Simulations based on index characteristics as of June 2022.

What is the relative risk?

Relative risk remains a major concern for asset owners who want to embark on a net-zero journey. The exhibits below show the simulated active share (the difference between the simulated portfolio’s holdings and the benchmark) and tracking error of the hypothetical portfolios with the assumption that the climate indexes’ active share and tracking error do not change over time.6 While the hypothetical portfolios in 2030 ended up with a 72% to 84% share of climate allocations their relative risk (as measured by tracking error) was not large. The active share for Investor B (ambitious targets) would be about 36% and tracking error about 1%.

Simulated path of active share and tracking error

Simulations are based on index characteristics as of June 2022.

The path forward?

Using MSCI climate indexes as market proxies we simulated a building-block approach that gradually shifts a hypothetical multi-asset-class portfolio from a broad market-based approach to one based on climate-change considerations. In our simulation this approach would have resulted in moderate levels of relative risk.

1“UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance: Target Setting Protocol: Second edition.” United Nations Environment Programme January 2022.

2The MSCI Climate Change Index and MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Index target 7% and 10% year-on-year self-decarbonization trajectories respectively. The equity and fixed-income indexes’ self-decarbonization trajectories are based on weighted average carbon intensity (tons of CO2 equivalent/USD 1 million of enterprise value including cash) and carbon emissions (metric tons of CO2) respectively. The current MSCI Climate Change Corporate Bond Indexes have achieved a high degree of decarbonization but they require some customization to achieve 7% decarbonization consistently.

3Within the corporate-bond portfolio the split is USD IG (60%) EUR IG (20%) USD HY (15%) and EUR HY (5%).

4Decarbonization target for equity and fixed income are based on WACI (tons of CO2 equivalent/USD 1 million of enterprise value including cash) and carbon emissions (metric tons of CO2) respectively.

5The analysis assumes no change in index-level green-revenue exposure tracking error and active share over time. It also assumes that climate indexes decarbonize over time but that the market indexes don’t. Since future index characteristics are not predictable characteristics of these hypothetical portfolios may differ from the simulations.

6Depending on the future decarbonization of the broad market the climate indexes may exhibit tracking error different from their current levels.

The amount of water available on earth always stays the same it’s the availability of water that changes.

In Pacific Island countries expensive desalination plants transform sea water into fresh water. Ultimately we can imagine a future where water can be extracted from anywhere in an economical fashion. Until then investing in water infrastructure seems like a compelling growth thesis.

Desalination is an attractive investment thesis but there aren’t many pure-play desalination stocks out there. In fact there aren’t many good ways to invest in water period. That’s why Xylem (XYL) stood out when we last covered them in a piece titled Investing in Smart Water Technology with Xylem.

Jacobs

Associate Director Research Content

For the first time since 2002 the euro has traded below parity with the U.S. dollar. While it has rebounded along with other risk assets back above a few times concerns about the economic impact of the war in Ukraine pushed the euro down to its lowest levels in 20 years.

While euro/dollar parity may have important psychological implications we know definitively that currency performance can have a significant impact on U.S. investor total returns in foreign markets.

Since the introduction of the euro on January 1 1999 the currency provided positive returns in 10 out of 23 years (43.47%). Over the same time frame equities in the region had positive performance in 14 out of 23 years (60.87%). On one hand equities seem to trend higher over time. On the other developed market1 currencies can either appreciate or depreciate as they mean-revert toward fair value. Below we examine four scenarios that try to separate equity risk from currency risk to try to understand which risks may be worth taking.

Scenario 1: Positive Calendar Year Returns for MSCI EMU Index and the Euro

When risk has been “on” the euro and stocks have historically tended to appreciate together. This has had the added benefit of magnifying gains for U.S.-based investors. While the magnitude of gains has also been significantly higher for equities than EUR/USD four out of eight years saw a double-digit appreciation for the euro. On its face it seems that if an investor is bullish on European stocks they should also be bullish on the currency.

Scenario 2: MSCI EMU Index and EUR down

However it seems that positive correlation can cut both ways. In years where European equities were down the euro also tended to be down thus magnifying losses for U.S. investors. In years with double-digit corrections in equities the euro depreciated on average by 5.1% per year. During more modest corrections the euro depreciated by 6.3% per year. In terms of risk management it seems currency hedging could be one way to potentially dampen drawdowns relative to an unhedged benchmark.

Scenario 3: MSCI EMU Index (Local) Up EUR Down

In the most classic case for currency hedging foreign equities (years when stocks are up but currencies are down) we see that at least one-third of the time currency losses completely outstrip the gains in equities. Put another way an investor can get the call right on equities but still end up losing money.

Scenario 4: MSCI EMU Index Down EUR Up

While anything is possible when risk has been off EUR has seldom been a safe haven with the exception of 2002 and 2020. In these instances a currency-hedged strategy underperformed in a down market.

FX-Hedged Exposure

For investors who don’t have a view on the direction of the euro or think the dollar will continue to strengthen a hedged option may be more suitable.

The WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ) which seeks to track the price and yield performance before fees and expenses of the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index was launched in 2012 and provides exposure to dividend-paying companies with an exporter tilt in the eurozone. The Fund hedges exposure to fluctuations in the euro by investing in one-month forward currency contracts.

Currency-hedged strategies aim to isolate returns to stock performance in the local markets without changes in the local currency. Comparing returns of the MSCI EMU Local index versus the USD version an outperformance ranging from 175 to 1017 basis points (bps) can be seen with lower volatility for all standardized periods. An even greater outperformance was generated for the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index over the same time frame ranging from 345 to 1305 bps.

Important Risks Related to this Article

There are risks associated with investing including the possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in currency involve additional special risks such as credit risk and interest rate fluctuations. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. As this Fund can have a high concentration in some issuers the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.

Back then we went by many names including ETF Trends ETF Database Alerian S Global Networks or the place where many ETF nerds from TV work together. Six months is a nice milestone to use to reflect on how things are going. In short VettaFi is on the path to transforming financial services from an industry into a community — one relationship at a time — while providing tremendous value.

Indeed VettaFi is on the short list for two ETF Express Awards one for our ETF research and one for our ETF data and you can vote today in different categories.

At VettaFi we’ve tried to connect our proprietary data insights gleaned from advisors with our data on ETFs. For example advisors recently told us during a webcast that given market conditions they were focusing more of their attention on emerging market equities over developed international equities. So we provided research showing that the two most popular emerging market ETFs — the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) — did not agree on what was an emerging market. For example South Korean stocks like Samsung were a major weighing in IEMG but not VWO. Making the decision between the two popular emerging markets ETFs is not as straightforward as many would like.

Another example of VettaFi’s efforts to blend ETF data and research was in June when we asked advisors “How have your views on the investment benefits of disruptive innovation shifted in the past year?” For perspective the most prominent of the disruptive innovation ETFs — the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) — was down approximately 60% for the year at the time of the article. Yet ARKK gathered $1.4 billion in the first half of 2022.

Interestingly 39% of advisors were more bullish than before while just 16% of respondents were more skeptical than before; the remaining 45% of those that were polled had not changed their views. In our research piece we highlighted that there were other disruptive-technology-focused ETFs and that their different construction styles created an opportunity for advisors to potentially tax loss harvest. They could sell ARKK and perhaps buy the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) the BlackRock Future Innovators ETF (BFTR) and the Goldman Sachs Future Tech Leaders Equity ETF (GTEK).

Meanwhile my colleagues Karrie Gordon and Dave Nadig have published multiple compelling research pieces in particular focused on what has increasingly been a hot topic: ESG. One such piece attempted to measure ESG’s unmeasurables by noting that the jury is still out on measuring social factors — the S pillar of ESG — and that inclusion is difficult to define much less quantify and measure. So while the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) has pulled in $1.5 billion thus far in 2022 there are challenges in answering whether ESG works or doesn’t in its objective.

In addition on this site we’ve covered many of the other compelling topics of 2022 including the aggressive Fed and the impact on fixed income investing shifting interest in commodities demand for energy infrastructure volatility in crypto investments and growing interest in high dividend ETFs. We hope advisors continue to leverage VettaFi’s ETF data and research to support end clients into 2023 and beyond. But before we get to 2023 don’t forget to vote in the ETF Express awards.

Eight firms controlled by Adani’s ports-to-power conglomerate including recent cement acquisitions have contributed more than a fifth of the 109-member MSCI India Index’s surge since end-June data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The index has outpaced Asian and emerging market peers during the period with a 12 per cent jump.

The eight Adani stocks are also a part of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index and the MSCI Emerging Market Index in which only China outweighs India showing the growing influence of the tycoon’s companies.

The equity gains have helped Adani’s wealth surpass that of Bill Gates and France’s Bernard Arnault in the past two months making him the first Asian to feature in the top echelon of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The jump in the MSCI India index’s market capitalisation during the current quarter has also been primarily dependent on Adani firms which contributed more than one-third of the surge data compiled by Bloomberg show.

NEW YORK Sept. 19 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of TuSimple Holdings Inc. (“TuSimple” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TSP) pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively the “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with TuSimple’s April 15 2021 initial public offering (“IPO”); and/or purchased or otherwise acquired TuSimple securities between April 15 2021 and August 1 2022 both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

TuSimple develops autonomous technology specifically designed for semi-trucks in the United States and internationally. It is developing a line of purpose-built Level 4 (“L4”) autonomous semi-trucks for the North American market. The Company operates its Autonomous Freight Network (“AFN”) L4 autonomous semi-trucks equipped with its autonomous driving technology. According to TuSimple AFN is an ecosystem that consists of L4 autonomous semi-trucks high-definition digital mapped routes terminals and TuSimple Connect a cloud-based autonomous operations oversight system.

On April 15 2021 TuSimple effected its IPO selling 33.8 million class A common shares at $40 per share generating $1.031 billion in gross proceeds.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ statements in the Registration Statement were materially false and misleading when made because it failed to disclose that: (i) TuSimple’s commitment to safety was significantly overstated and Defendants concealed fundamental problems with the Company’s technology; (ii) TuSimple was rushing the testing of its autonomous driving technology in order to deliver driverless trucks to the market ahead of its more safety-conscious competitors; (iii) there was a corporate culture within TuSimple that suppressed or ignored safety concerns in favor of unrealistically ambitious testing and delivery schedules; and (iv) this conduct made accidents involving the Company’s autonomous driving technology more likely and invited enhanced regulatory scrutiny.

On August 1 2022 the Wall Street Journal published an article titled “Self-Driving Truck Accident Draws Attention to Safety at TuSimple” which brought to light a number of previously undisclosed concerns that undermined Defendants’ representations and omissions concerning the Company’s safety. The article referenced an April 6 2022 accident involving a truck fitted with TuSimple’s autonomous driving technology. Among many other things the article reported that “[t]he accident which regulators disclosed to the public in June after TuSimple filed a report on the incident underscores concerns that the autonomous-trucking company is risking safety on public roads in a rush to deliver driverless trucks to market according to independent analysts and more than a dozen of the company’s former employees.”

On this news the Company’s stock price fell $0.97 per share to close at $8.99 per share on August 1 2022.

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff you must move the Court no later than October 31 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you choose to take no action you may remain an absent class member.

It all happened because Netflix lost the one show I wanted to watch the most.

And now that I've finished that show? Well the good news is that I'm keeping Netflix turned off (at least for the immediate future). In its absence I've had no lack of shows to watch thanks to three other streaming services that are meeting my needs for shows. Heck one of them just added a movie I've wanted to see (without going to the cinema).

This entire process as I'll document below shows that Netflix does not have a strangle-hold on the world of streaming. It may be ubiquitous. Shows such as The Tinder Swindler and Inventing Anna may dominate social media and there's a ton of buzz around the Bridgerton season 2 teaser trailer but you don't need it every month. In fact you may also be asking should you cancel Netflix?

I say ""every"" month for a reason — I've already come across a reason I may need to go back to Netflix. For now though I'm happy without it. Here's why.

HBO Max has been killing it

While I left Netflix because of Halt and Catch Fire leaving Netflix (and its new hefty $19.99 monthly price for 4K) I have no immediate intention of leaving HBO Max which isn't cheap either at $15 per month.

That's because between Peacemaker Euphoria and The Righteous Gemstones HBO Max has been on fire as of late. All three shows are currently proving that while Succession was HBO's most buzzed about show last fall the service is far more than just that one show (while Netflix can often times feel like the place that is eventually bringing Stranger Things and The Witcher back at some point).

And while those shows will end soon that amount of concurrent quality gives me reason to expect more. From Euphoria's constantly anxious and manic/depressive energy to Peacemaker's himbo energy to all of the hilarious family drama of Gemstones HBO Max is great at giving me a range of vibes.

AMC Plus has been good — but it's incomplete

The big reason why I had to leave Netflix was to make room for the $8.99 per month AMC Plus the only place I could watch Halt and Catch Fire. Then after I canceled Netflix I realized I wouldn't have to spend that cash thanks to a second trial from Apple TV Channels. I kept Netflix canceled though as that $20 is nice to have in my pocket.

And over the last two weeks I loved watching Halt and Catch Fire with every free second I had. Honestly it's a true hidden gem of a show that's using a fictional alternate history of the rise of the personal computer and the internet to show us five broken but lovable characters. To say that the Halt and Catch Fire finale and the episodes leading up to it left me emotional would be an understatement. They wrecked me (and I loved every minute).

Unfortunately AMC Plus isn't the true AMC super-subscription I want it to be as we'll get to below. While it offers episodes of Killing Eve (which is about to come back for season four) it doesn't have Killing Eve season two. And it also doesn't have any episodes of the other big AMC series I want to watch Better Call Saul.

Hulu's the service I'm about to lean on

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

Fortunately the Black Friday $1 per month Hulu deal I got last year is still running and Hulu has all the Killing Eve I need. It also has the other show I'm catching up on What We Do In The Shadows (which I'm still in the middle of season 3 on).

And for the immediate future that's going to keep me more than busy. It's even got Nightmare Alley which recently come here from cinemas. Free Guy which I've been curious about is due too.

So I am good without Netflix at the moment. Or at least I thought.

How Netflix may get me back

Unfortunately my time away from Netflix may have a predetermined end-date coming in the near future (No I'm not excited about Jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy). As you may have gathered I've become enamored with watching all the shows I've always said I'll watch. On April 18 Better Call Saul (which is on Netflix in the U.S.) finally returns for its sixth and final season. Or at least half of that season as AMC broke the two halves of Better Call Saul season 6 in half and Variety reports the latter half isn't due until July 11.

(Image credit: Greg Lewis/AMC)

And Better Call Saul much like Halt and Catch Fire is one of those shows that I watched enough to know I liked it and now want to go back to (since it's returning).

I've watched almost all of Better Call Saul season one and that gives me five seasons and an episode left to watch. Netflix unfortunately doesn't have Better Call Saul season five yet. And nobody does. And so I might wind up spending $10 on Better Call Saul season 5 on Amazon. That's as annoying to me as anyone else.

I write all of the above without much confidence in what decision I'll make because I don't know where the series will go. What I'm hoping is that AMC Plus gets Better Call Saul seasons 1-5 and soon. That would be a smart way to drive subscriptions and promote the new season. But Better Call Saul shows no signs of leaving Netflix.

This brings me to two subjects that aren't fun for most folks: math and the concept of ownership of digital media. I could down the 31 Better Call Saul episodes I haven't seen that are on Netflix in one month's time (which would cost $19.99 for 4K which the show streams in). Then it costs me another $10 for season 5 if everything holds still.

None of that is good but it brings me to my conclusion. You can be fine without Netflix for a bit but eventually it always comes a'calling back. No wonder it's one of the best streaming services.

Gender parity in Hollywood still has a long way to go baby but while we wait for the industry to get their collective crap together what we choose to watch speaks volumes. We’ve combed through Netflix’s streaming sprawl to find the best television shows and limited series from female creators for you to enjoy.

What each of the shows on this stacked list of Netflix heavy hitters has in common is that they were all written directed created or produced by a woman and frankly? That’s nothing to sniff at these days. This group covers everything from the award-winning to the comforting the heart-wrenching to the absurd — and every single one of them is at the top of its game.

Women are great. TV is great. TV made by women is great. No further questions your honor!

1. Grace and Frankie

After their husbands and long-term business partners announce they’ve been secretly in love for decades high-strung Grace (Jane Fonda) and crunchy hippie Frankie (Lily Tomlin) are forced into an unlikely friendship and roommate-ship when the only place they have left to live is the La Jolla beach house their families co-own. This is The Odd Couple for the modern era a comedy that insists that everyone no matter their age can have their fair share of high jinks. (Wait until you get to the episodes about trying to use vibrators with arthritis.)

It’s a deeply charming zany and lovable show with a stellar cast featuring Sam Waterston Martin Sheen Brooklyn Decker Ethan Embry June Diane Raphael and Baron Vaughn. Created by Marta Kauffman (co-creator of Friends!) and Howard J. Morris Grace and Frankie is a perfect comfort watch that will leave you feeling like you should give your best friend a call.

2. Bridgerton

Where to begin with the scandalous sexy and silly sensation that is Bridgerton? In this period dramedy Regency-era Londoners look for love under the critical eye of the Queen and a host of courtiers while dodging scandal at every turn. It's Gossip Girl meets Downton Abbey with a How To Get Away with Murder-type twist that's undeniably Shonda Rhimes . You're going to love it so much so that you should plan on bingeing this one straight-through. — * Alison Foreman Entertainment Reporter

3. Maid

Created by Molly Smith Metzler and adapted from Stephanie Land’s bestselling memoir Maid: Hard Work Low Pay and a Mother's Will to Survive Maid is an absolute gut punch that will likely make you cry more than once. Margaret Qualley is excellent as Alex a young woman struggling to leave an abusive relationship while continuing to care for toddler daughter; she’s paired with her real-life mother Andie McDowell who is fantastic as Alex’s well-meaning but unreliable mom.

We follow Alex’s agonizing journey from navigating a women’s shelter to facing the baffling catch-22’s of the American welfare system (she can’t get state-sponsored child care without a job but she can’t get a job without child care) and more. It’s a powerful meditation on perseverance as well as a brutal examination of how incredibly short the United States falls in supporting those struggling to survive.

4. The Baby-Sitters Club

Warm funny and unapologetically optimistic this 2020 adaptation of the hugely popular Ann M. Martin YA book series is a superb watch for audiences of all ages. A group of preteen girls each with their own distinctive personality fashion sense and set of familial issues band together to start a baby-sitting club in their neighborhood. The friendships are strong the stories are relatable and the life lessons are surprisingly sophisticated. The Baby-Sitters Club is the smart but sweet show that celebrates girlhood in all of its many forms one we wish we had when we were younger — but we’ll settle for it well into our adulthood thank you very much.

5. GLOW

It’s the Gooorgeous Ladies of Wrestling! Created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch GLOW is one of those shows that makes you smile just thinking of it. A masterful blend of rage-fueled ‘80s feminism and timeless comedic beats this half-hour dramedy delivers everything you could want in great TV each and every episode throughout its three seasons. Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin lead an unparalleled ensemble in a journey we’ll never be ready to see end. Here’s lookin’ at you Season 4. — * A.F.

The most culturally significant project Netflix released in 2019 Ava DuVernay's When They See Us revisits the case of the Central Park Five in excruciating detail. Examining the wrongful convictions of five Black and Latino men for the rape of a woman in 1989 — for which they would be exonerated over a decade later — this poignant true crime miniseries offers a heart-wrenching look at the flaws in our justice system. Not only spectacular viewing When They See Us highlights the insidious biases that plague our society and the vulnerable people put at risk. — * A.F.

You don’t want to spend another second without this sweet love story in your life!

8. Sense8

Created by the Wachowski sisters and J. Michael Straczynski Sense8 is well exactly as trippy as you’d expect a sci-fi drama created by those three to be. The series follows eight strangers who discover in quick succession that they’re linked by a single mind and soul and that that makes them a target for certain mysterious forces. Thrills ensue in the form of cool superpowers deadly chases sinister conspiracies and intricately choreographed fight scenes all shot and edited together with dazzling precision.

But what makes Sense8 feel truly special is its emphasis on emotional connection. It’s a show that feels almost radical in its earnestness — in its plea for empathy in its faith in humanity in its celebration for love. It wears its tender beating heart on its sleeve and invites you to touch it and then asks you if perhaps you wouldn’t like to open up your own heart to it too. - * Angie Han Deputy Entertainment Editor

9. Never Have I Ever

Created by Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher this smart sweet coming-of-age story was among the most fulfilling new Netflix binges of 2020. Then it came back and wowed us again.

Lead Maitreyi Ramakrishnan will steal your heart as Devi a high school sophomore reeling from the loss of her father the year before — but with big plans for a future as vibrant and fearless as she. Culturally important as it is authentic Never Have I Ever serves not only as a critical step for representation but also as a dreamy teen rom-com you'll adore. — * A.F.

10. Crash Landing on You

When a South Korean heiress goes paragliding a freak storm sends her flying off course and she crash lands in the North Korean DMZ. For most people this story would end in a swift execution. Luckily Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) is found by understanding North Korean army captain Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) — and total dreamboat! As the two navigate their precarious situation and deep cultural divides they somehow form a connection and you guessed it begin to fall in love.

This smash hit drama series written by Park Ji-eun and directed by Lee Jeong-hyo has everything: action social commentary and a gut-wrenching forbidden romance. Crash Landing on You has become a global phenomenon acclaimed in China Japan and the Philippines and frequently topping K-drama lists in the U.S. A must-watch. *

11. Russian Doll

Russian Doll gets as close to a perfect Netflix binge watch as possible.

It’s short with eight 30-minute episodes forming its first season. It’s bold covering themes of mortality trauma and human connection against the backdrop of New York’s East Village. And it’s flat-out hilarious to boot. Natasha Lyonne co-created and starred as Nadia a woman who becomes trapped in a time loop after dying on her 36th birthday. Nadia’s Groundhog Day-esque adventure becomes increasingly complex as the series progresses and she races against the loop to discover why she can’t stop dying — and what her loop has to do with Alan an alleged stranger who’s experiencing the exact same cycle. — * Alexis Nedd Senior Entertainment Reporter

12. Jane the Virgin

Jane is a young woman in Miami who is deeply in love with her sweet loyal boyfriend and also well it’s there in the title a virgin so naturally she was pretty confused when she found out she was accidentally artificially inseminated during a routine gynecological visit. Now the religious Jane is pregnant with another man’s baby — specifically the handsome playboy and married hotelier she used to have a crush on years ago. And we’re just getting started folks!

Developed by Jennie Snyder Urman (Gilmore Girls 90210 Reign Charmed) Jane the Virgin playfully employs and parodies telenovela tropes in its storytelling while also taking the time to explore the real emotional consequences of these wild plot twists. (Jane is loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela Juana la Virgen). It’s a delightful and captivating combination that sets Jane in a class of its own. A heartfelt comedy boasting both absurdity and grounded emotional depth — there’s simply no other show like it!

13. The Chair

The Chair isn’t without its flaws but you do get a lot for a little with this smart dramedy from creators Amanda Peet and Annie Julia Wyman. Set on the campus of the fictional Pembroke University Season 1 of The Chair follows English department head Dr. Ji-Yoon Kim (Sandra Oh) as she grapples with a scandal involving her fellow professor and love interest (Jay Duplass). Choppy pacing and some muddled messaging around cancel culture make this an imperfect yet worthy binge clocking in at six episodes in just three hours. — * A.F.

14. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt

Nothing hits quite like a Tina Fey show with its laugh-a-minute scripts heightened realities and absurdist humor. Running from 2015 to 2019 Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was one of the best of the bunch co-created by the SNL alum who also occasionally made an appearance onscreen. Ellie Kemper is perfectly cast as Kimmy Schmidt a young woman who spent most of her life in a kidnapper’s underground bunker and now free is trying to navigate the modern adult world with the life experience of an 8-year-old child with significant trauma. It’s silly it’s wildly optimistic with a streak of dark humor and it made the impossibly funny and talented Tituss Burgess the star he was always meant to be. Plus Carol Kane is Kimmy’s cranky landlord — what could be better?

Speaking to the Executive Director of Najel Foundation Mrs. Naomi Naa Adjeley Anang mentioned that receiving the honour as the Ghana Outstanding Woman in NGO depicts how the positive impacts of the foundation is making to the lives of some Ghanaians who have benefited from its project.

“Achieving this milestone could not be accomplished without God being the ultimate strength of this foundation hence we wholeheartedly appreciate Him for the unflinching mercies and I must commend my indefatigable B.O.D Executives and all Lovely Members of Najel Foundation who has helped in this journey” she said.

According to her Najel Foundation being adjudged the NGO of the Year was only a recognition of its tremendous impact on the society which has experienced the benevolent arm of the foundation and its sole impact is to transform lives by putting smiles on the faces of the less-privileged through its judiciously planned projects.

Mrs. Anang disclosed the foundation’s upcoming project in the month of October to commemorate ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’ as a means of creating awareness about the cankerworm to save lives.

“Early detection of the condition as our health practitioners say is the best and leads to effective treatment and positive prognosis which has the tendency to save lives so Najel Foundation would join the campaign by organising a screening exercise” she hinted.

President of the Foundation Mr. Isaac Rexford Maduku who accentuated the thoughts of the Executive Director highlighted that Najel Foundation deserves the recognition as a vibrant foundation making impacts in communities and is opened to partnerships and sponsorships by reaching out to Najel on Instagram @najelfoundation to continue making significant impacts to the life of the marginalised.

According to The Australian Financial Review she told staff that she leaving the business for personal reasons.

Fellows who has been credited with establishing the REA Group’s dominance in the digital real estate space oversaw online assets such as realestate.com.au the US site realtor.com and India’s housing.com.

Prior to joining News Corp in 2019 she was the CEO of REA Group from 2014 to 2019 Australia Post’s executive general manager of communication management services from 2013 to 2014 and Microsoft’s president Asia Pacific from 2011 to 2013.

Insiders told the publication that she was a trusted member of the company by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and was a potential candidate for the role of chief executive of News Corp.

News Corp CEO Robert Thomson shared news of her retirement at a Goldman Sachs conference last week and praised her track record at the company.

At the conference he noted that Fellows played a crucial role in “connecting the Australian culture with the US culture” in regard to the digital real estate business.

Thomson added that she would not be replaced and that he will take on her responsibilities in the role.

“The need for someone to drive that conversation in the same way isn’t quite there and that’s a mark of [Fellows’] success and her contribution commercially and culturally” he said at the conference.

According to the publication Fellows will return to Australia from New York and will focus on board responsibilities as well as serving on the boards of the REA Group and Swedish company Hemnet.

News of Fellows’ New York-based role in was revealed at the end of 2018. At the time she said: “It has been an absolute privilege working with the team and the board at REA Group.”

“It’s one of the exciting things about the opportunity. It allows me to take on a new challenge while continuing to work alongside these incredible people – all in an industry I am so passionate about. I feel very fortunate. There could not be a more exciting time for a role like this.

Fellows continued: “We can clearly share lessons from around the company and continue to raise the bar on best practices.

“I’m really looking forward to working with Ryan and the team at realtor.com and our talented people around the world with the aim of creating amazing property experiences for consumers globally. There is no doubt that there are some interesting opportunities to broaden our international reach and serve more people” she added.

Since 2019 News Corp Australia’s television network Sky News Australia has built an enormous digital presence on platforms like YouTube and Facebook off the back of its opinion video content. Now it’s got its sights set on the newest tech behemoth TikTok and it has picked up reactionary millennial Carla Efstratiou to be the face of its account.

Earlier this month the network quietly launched a TikTok account sharing clips of public figures like politicians and celebrities excerpts from its opinion programming and some original content.

Much like the channel’s YouTube videos most TikTok videos are about international culture war takes on topics like Joe Biden and Meghan Markle. Many of the account’s captions eschew an objective news tone for an outright partisan voice.

A video from Andrew Bolt’s show talking about Markle is captioned “The irony of a privlidged [sic] TV presenter calling out the queen for colonialism she never comitted [sic].” Another video of Kamala Harris speaking is captioned: “Secure border? It was more secure under Trump and you want to get rid of the wall.”

sky news has joined tiktok and some of their captions are…interesting



like i know there’s a split between their news & opinion at times but this account seems to be almost all opinion



and even on youtube – where many opinion vids have gone viral – captions are never like this pic.twitter.com/IXJh1NltF3 — Leonardo Puglisi (@Leo_Puglisi6) September 13 2022

The account’s original content comprises editorial monologues from Efstratiou.

Efstratiou has frequently appeared in the media as a small-business owner and young conservative. In 2012 she wrote about how she was a dyed-in-the-wool Liberal voter and Alan Jones listener with a picture of Margaret Thatcher next to her bed and a crush on Malcolm Turnbull. In 2014 she earned the ire of the Triple J audience by saying there’s no reason to be homeless and arguing against spending money on the environment.

Now in her early 30s Efstratiou launched a TikTok account called @gowokegobrokeaus (naturally) where she riffed on news with her reactionary views. With just more than 11000 followers — a reasonable but not enormous number — Efstratiou seemed to mostly evoke criticism and rebuttal from TikTok audiences.

Some of her previous videos include:

Sharing anti-trans views including falsely claiming that men can’t give birth criticising companies for giving gender affirmation leave that Medicare should pay for her lip fillers if they pay for gender affirmation procedures that men in Spain would begin to identify as women so they could access menstrual leave and praising Scott Morrison for standing up for transphobic Liberal candidate Katherine Deves

Echoing anti-vaccine rhetoric by sharing videos saying that “something doesn’t add up” about daily COVID-19 death tolls that had more vaccinated people dying than unvaccinated questioning why there are “so many” booster shots and proudly saying that while having got her original vaccines she won’t ever get a booster

Calling COVID restrictions such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates “completely unnecessary” and saying it’s the “biggest corruption in history”

Saying that LGBTQIA+ people don’t want equality but “superiority”

Claiming that there’s no gender pay gap but instead women are paid less for a variety of reasons like not working in “scaleable industries”

Reposting a Jordan Peterson clip criticising climate action advocates as pushing for change to address their “existential terror”

Defending Australia’s asylum seeker policy by saying that Sri Lanka’s entire population would want to come here if not for the boat turnback policy

Saying that low unemployment means that there’s no excuse for people not to have a job and blaming people’s unemployment on their inability to spell in TikTok comments.

Far from toning down her views — which wouldn’t be out of place on Sky News’ Outsiders — Sky News Australia has brought her on board to replicate her lo-fi unpolished videos on their channel.

On the Sky News Australia account Efstratiou has said that Lisa Wilkinson shouldn’t cover the queen’s funeral because of her husband Peter FitzSimons and his links to the Australian republican movement; called Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi “dumb” for saying that Queen Elizabeth II was the head of a racist empire; and slammed Lizzo’s promotion of body acceptance as “promoting unhealthiness”.

Neither Efstratiou nor Sky News Australia responded to Crikey‘s inquiries.

Notably absent from Sky News’ TikTok debut is its original Australian news content. Key network figures such as Kieran Gilbert Andrew Clennell and Laura Jayes are nowhere to be seen.

Sky News’ early returns are promising. The network’s account has nearly 7000 followers already with a handful of viral videos of repurposed clips from their television hosts and Efstratiou’s original content in less than two weeks.

The network was able to grow enormous YouTube and Facebook audiences by pumping out emotive culture war content at scale targeted at international reactionary right-wing audiences that had the veneer of the respectability of a cable news network. On TikTok it appears it’s repeating that strategy yet again with a young TikTok-native conservative at the top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzLWd1YXJkLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2VzdGJyb29rLWxpc3RzLW1hc3NpdmUtbWFuc2lvbi1mb3ItNDQ3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los Angeles Lakers' guard Russell Westbrook lists massive mansion for $44.7m - realestate.com.au,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzLWd1YXJkLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2VzdGJyb29rLWxpc3RzLW1hc3NpdmUtbWFuc2lvbi1mb3ItNDQ3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950886F50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

According to The Australian Financial Review she told staff that she leaving the business for personal reasons.

Fellows who has been credited with establishing the REA Group’s dominance in the digital real estate space oversaw online assets such as realestate.com.au the US site realtor.com and India’s housing.com.

Prior to joining News Corp in 2019 she was the CEO of REA Group from 2014 to 2019 Australia Post’s executive general manager of communication management services from 2013 to 2014 and Microsoft’s president Asia Pacific from 2011 to 2013.

Insiders told the publication that she was a trusted member of the company by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and was a potential candidate for the role of chief executive of News Corp.

News Corp CEO Robert Thomson shared news of her retirement at a Goldman Sachs conference last week and praised her track record at the company.

At the conference he noted that Fellows played a crucial role in “connecting the Australian culture with the US culture” in regard to the digital real estate business.

Thomson added that she would not be replaced and that he will take on her responsibilities in the role.

“The need for someone to drive that conversation in the same way isn’t quite there and that’s a mark of [Fellows’] success and her contribution commercially and culturally” he said at the conference.

According to the publication Fellows will return to Australia from New York and will focus on board responsibilities as well as serving on the boards of the REA Group and Swedish company Hemnet.

News of Fellows’ New York-based role in was revealed at the end of 2018. At the time she said: “It has been an absolute privilege working with the team and the board at REA Group.”

“It’s one of the exciting things about the opportunity. It allows me to take on a new challenge while continuing to work alongside these incredible people – all in an industry I am so passionate about. I feel very fortunate. There could not be a more exciting time for a role like this.

Fellows continued: “We can clearly share lessons from around the company and continue to raise the bar on best practices.

“I’m really looking forward to working with Ryan and the team at realtor.com and our talented people around the world with the aim of creating amazing property experiences for consumers globally. There is no doubt that there are some interesting opportunities to broaden our international reach and serve more people” she added.

Since 2019 News Corp Australia’s television network Sky News Australia has built an enormous digital presence on platforms like YouTube and Facebook off the back of its opinion video content. Now it’s got its sights set on the newest tech behemoth TikTok and it has picked up reactionary millennial Carla Efstratiou to be the face of its account.

Earlier this month the network quietly launched a TikTok account sharing clips of public figures like politicians and celebrities excerpts from its opinion programming and some original content.

Much like the channel’s YouTube videos most TikTok videos are about international culture war takes on topics like Joe Biden and Meghan Markle. Many of the account’s captions eschew an objective news tone for an outright partisan voice.

A video from Andrew Bolt’s show talking about Markle is captioned “The irony of a privlidged [sic] TV presenter calling out the queen for colonialism she never comitted [sic].” Another video of Kamala Harris speaking is captioned: “Secure border? It was more secure under Trump and you want to get rid of the wall.”

sky news has joined tiktok and some of their captions are…interesting



like i know there’s a split between their news & opinion at times but this account seems to be almost all opinion



and even on youtube – where many opinion vids have gone viral – captions are never like this pic.twitter.com/IXJh1NltF3 — Leonardo Puglisi (@Leo_Puglisi6) September 13 2022

The account’s original content comprises editorial monologues from Efstratiou.

Efstratiou has frequently appeared in the media as a small-business owner and young conservative. In 2012 she wrote about how she was a dyed-in-the-wool Liberal voter and Alan Jones listener with a picture of Margaret Thatcher next to her bed and a crush on Malcolm Turnbull. In 2014 she earned the ire of the Triple J audience by saying there’s no reason to be homeless and arguing against spending money on the environment.

Now in her early 30s Efstratiou launched a TikTok account called @gowokegobrokeaus (naturally) where she riffed on news with her reactionary views. With just more than 11000 followers — a reasonable but not enormous number — Efstratiou seemed to mostly evoke criticism and rebuttal from TikTok audiences.

Some of her previous videos include:

Sharing anti-trans views including falsely claiming that men can’t give birth criticising companies for giving gender affirmation leave that Medicare should pay for her lip fillers if they pay for gender affirmation procedures that men in Spain would begin to identify as women so they could access menstrual leave and praising Scott Morrison for standing up for transphobic Liberal candidate Katherine Deves

Echoing anti-vaccine rhetoric by sharing videos saying that “something doesn’t add up” about daily COVID-19 death tolls that had more vaccinated people dying than unvaccinated questioning why there are “so many” booster shots and proudly saying that while having got her original vaccines she won’t ever get a booster

Calling COVID restrictions such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates “completely unnecessary” and saying it’s the “biggest corruption in history”

Saying that LGBTQIA+ people don’t want equality but “superiority”

Claiming that there’s no gender pay gap but instead women are paid less for a variety of reasons like not working in “scaleable industries”

Reposting a Jordan Peterson clip criticising climate action advocates as pushing for change to address their “existential terror”

Defending Australia’s asylum seeker policy by saying that Sri Lanka’s entire population would want to come here if not for the boat turnback policy

Saying that low unemployment means that there’s no excuse for people not to have a job and blaming people’s unemployment on their inability to spell in TikTok comments.

Far from toning down her views — which wouldn’t be out of place on Sky News’ Outsiders — Sky News Australia has brought her on board to replicate her lo-fi unpolished videos on their channel.

On the Sky News Australia account Efstratiou has said that Lisa Wilkinson shouldn’t cover the queen’s funeral because of her husband Peter FitzSimons and his links to the Australian republican movement; called Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi “dumb” for saying that Queen Elizabeth II was the head of a racist empire; and slammed Lizzo’s promotion of body acceptance as “promoting unhealthiness”.

Neither Efstratiou nor Sky News Australia responded to Crikey‘s inquiries.

Notably absent from Sky News’ TikTok debut is its original Australian news content. Key network figures such as Kieran Gilbert Andrew Clennell and Laura Jayes are nowhere to be seen.

Sky News’ early returns are promising. The network’s account has nearly 7000 followers already with a handful of viral videos of repurposed clips from their television hosts and Efstratiou’s original content in less than two weeks.

The network was able to grow enormous YouTube and Facebook audiences by pumping out emotive culture war content at scale targeted at international reactionary right-wing audiences that had the veneer of the respectability of a cable news network. On TikTok it appears it’s repeating that strategy yet again with a young TikTok-native conservative at the top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzLWd1YXJkLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2VzdGJyb29rLWxpc3RzLW1hc3NpdmUtbWFuc2lvbi1mb3ItNDQ3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los Angeles Lakers' guard Russell Westbrook lists massive mansion for $44.7m - realestate.com.au,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.realestate.com.au', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/los-angeles-lakers-guard-russell-westbrook-lists-massive-mansion-for-447m/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395166E080>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzLWd1YXJkLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2VzdGJyb29rLWxpc3RzLW1hc3NpdmUtbWFuc2lvbi1mb3ItNDQ3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

But while residents say they support green energy there's a vocal contingent pushing back against building 2000 acres of panels so close to their communities.

Frank Gieringer rides a flatbed trailer toward rows of apple trees loaded with Galas Crimson Crisps and other varieties ready for the picking.

His family owns this bucolic orchard and berry farm outside Edgerton Kansas. Just beyond its borders lie 2000 acres of land a potential location for the state’s first utility-scale solar farm.

Gieringer says he’d welcome the new neighbor.

“To really look at ‘em it’s not a heck of a lot of difference than looking at an orchard or a vineyard really. It’s just rows of panels” Gieringer says. “They’re harvesting sun. Same thing I’m doin’. All of agriculture sells the sunshine.”

For years the Florida-based company NextEra Energy Resources has been talking about building a solar farm that would span Johnson and Douglas counties. But it wasn’t until this spring that both county commissions passed regulations allowing the process to move forward.

If built the West Gardner Solar Project would be the largest in Kansas — generating 320 megawatts enough to power thousands of residences and businesses.

But not everyone agrees that’s a good thing. While some people are eager for Kansas to fully embrace renewable energy many residents say they don’t want the countryside — their countryside — turned into industrial sprawl.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdGhhbWdhemV0dGUuY29tLzEzMC1vcGluaW9uLzExNTg2LWxvbmctaXNsYW5kLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1odWItbmV3LXlvcmstcmVuZXdhYmxlLW5vcnRoZWFzdC1uYXRpb25hbC1ncmlk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Long Island is Becoming a Clean Energy Hub to Replicate Across the Northeast and Beyond,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdGhhbWdhemV0dGUuY29tLzEzMC1vcGluaW9uLzExNTg2LWxvbmctaXNsYW5kLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1odWItbmV3LXlvcmstcmVuZXdhYmxlLW5vcnRoZWFzdC1uYXRpb25hbC1ncmlk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501ED4E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

When so many professional athletes just wear Nike Dunk Lows these days we appreciate it when someone steps outside wearing something different. It took some time to investigate but below is everything fans need to know about Barkley's kicks.

Patta x Nike Air Max 1 'White'

Patta x Nike Air Max 1 'White' Nike

Barkley wore the Patta x Nike Air Max 1 'White' before the Giants game on Sunday. The Nike Air Max 1 was originally released in 1987 and has been remixed in various colorways and designs over the years.

However the Patta x Nike Air Max 1 'White' was released on August 26 2022 for $150. Fans can easily find a pair for less than $300 on sneaker resale sites such as StockX GOAT or eBay.

This colorway of the Air Max 1 was designed as part of a collaboration between Nike and Dutch sneaker boutique Patta. The neutral-colored shoe mixes a light grey mesh upper with white leather overlays and a matching white leather mudguard.

This version of the Air Max 1 features a wavy topline that’s synonymous with Patta. Metallic silver accents are woven onto the Patta tongue tag mini-Swoosh logo on the lateral forefoot and Nike Air branding on the heel. The midsole is off-white to provide a vintage aesthetic.

In addition to being a bruising running back Barkley is also a thoughtful sneakerhead. The 25-year-old has clearly spent a lot of time doing his research on footwear. Week Two of the NFL season is not over but Barkley has the FanNation Kicks' game ball right now.

Ever since his debut in 1996 Tiger Woods has been identified for various reasons. One of which is being the face of Nike Golf. Having the Nike Swoosh on his outfit Woods has been one of the biggest possession of the American apparel giant.

Walking down memory lane the association between Nike and Woods dates back to the year 1996. Leaving a lasting impression with his incredible performances in the amateur tournaments Woods became a Nike-sponsored player even before his pro debut. As per reports the first contract between Woods and Nike was a 5-year deal worth $40 million. 26 years later how much is Tiger Woods worth to Nike today?

The monumental history of Nike and Tiger Woods

Woods started his career with a $40 million contract for Nike. However five years seemed sufficiently enough for the American sensation to prove to Nike that he is worth much more.

5 majors 19 tour tiles top spot in World rankings 3 PGA Tour player of the year awards and 3 PGA Player of the year awards later it was in 2001 that Woods and Nike renewed their partnership. Even though the two agreed on the same 5-year span the success of Woods had now taken the deal to a whopping $100 million.

Walking on his own-defined path of success Woods went on to pursue his aim of becoming the greatest player of all time. Five years later it was in 2006 that Woods and Nike signed their third contract. Goes without saying ten years seemed a considerable time for Nike to put Woods on the list of their biggest assets.

The result? Unlike the previous two contracts the third contract between the two was sealed for a period of seven years ending in 2013.

The latest association of the two giants

The year 2013 is often referred to by many as the biggest year of their association. In July 2013 the then Nike golf president Cindy Davis released a statement confirming the renewal of their association with Nike.

“We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Tiger. He is one of Nike’s most iconic athletes and has played an integral part in Nike Golf’s growth since the very beginning” she said.

As per reports the fourth contract between Nike and Woods was signed for a massive $200 million. An amount that prompted Woods’s manager to assert that Woods would continue to remain with Nike for the rest of his career. “We’re comfortable with where we ended up and the career trajectory that Tiger will be on with Nike” he said.

Woods has had numerous ups and downs in his personal as well as professional life. Widening the room for discussion apart from Nike Woods has also been a part of numerous other sponsorship deals in his 26-year-long career. However giving a glimpse at the unfortunate part many of these sponsors have taken a back seat when Woods’ career was going through a rough patch.

On the contrary Nike has made sure to stick with Woods through thick and thin. A gesture that has given the greatest golfer of all time all the more reason to stay bonded with the apparel giant.

Over the years Woods hasn’t just contributed to Nike by showing up on the golf course with their apparel. In addition to that he has also taken up the responsibility to be one of their most prominent global brand ambassadors. The former World No. 1 has been a part of Nike’s most successful advertisement campaigns over the years.

Freight rail has been a symbol of the nation’s economic might and ingenuity ever since.

In recent years some of the biggest names on Wall Street have made significant investments in railroads reaping big stock gains as railroads reported higher profits. But the underlying strategies that strengthened railroads’ bottom lines have caused friction with customers regulators and particularly workers — giving rise to a contract dispute that threatened a nationwide shutdown of the railway system.

After losing ground to trucking in the mid-20th century the rail industry managed to recover through decades of consolidation and a push for efficiency. Critics say those same dynamics created a system with thin staffing and minimal competition making it particularly vulnerable to shocks like the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s a trend that’s been going on for years” said Martin J. Oberman the chairman of the Surface Transportation Board the federal agency charged with regulating freight railways. “The pendulum swung pretty far and it allowed these people to exercise tremendous power over their customers and over their labor force.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL25ld3MvcmVidWlsZC1yZW5ldy1yZXBvd2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rebuild Renew Repower,"RAILWAY AGE SEPTEMBER 2022 ISSUE: For many freight railroads upgrading their existing locomotive fleets to current standards of improved fuel efficiency and emissions reductions is far more cost-effective than acquiring new power. Technology—AC traction Tier 3 or 4 prime-movers updated control systems real-time health monitoring—makes it all possible.

OEMs like Wabtec and Progress Rail (EMD/Caterpillar) now identify rebuilding locomotives to better-than-new status as their primary line of business. Companies such as NRE Knoxville Locomotive Works Brookville Equipment Cummins and Railserve LEAF also supply this market. And Class I railroad Norfolk Southern (NS) sometimes working in concert with Wabtec or Progress Rail but often independently rebuilds and repowers locomotives through its TMS (Thoroughbred Mechanical Services) division located in Altoona Pa. in the facilities of the former Pennsylvania Railroad’s legendary Juniata Locomotive Works.



This GP38CC switcher is EPA Tier 3-certified and delivers 2130 hp at 1800 rpm. Its Cummins QSK50 Tier 3 Power Module is designed for ease of installation into multiple locomotive models. Cummins pre-built the entire unit including the engine alternator airintake exhaust and air compressor drive on a base skid. New cooling cores were installed in the existing cooling hatch. The Power Module is equipped with a Kato dual-bearing traction alternator rated at 1600 kW of traction power and 288 kW of 120v/3-phase companion power. If required the alternator can be configured to meet the needs of a specific locomotive application.Cummins photo

Locomotives are a little like classic cars. Take good care of them and they’ll last many years decades even. But at some point they will need to be rebuilt if they are to continue in regular service. “Restored” is not the correct term here because restoration is meant for locomotives designated for occasional service on special excursions or static display as cosmetically accurate museum pieces. “Resto-mod” is a more accurate analogy. For a classic car it could be a 1969 Pontiac GTO rebuilt with a modern LS-series V-8 electronic fuel injection disc brakes rack and pinion steering five- or six-speed Tremec transmission with overdrive Hotchkis suspension electric radiator fans 17-inch wheels etc. etc.—something that’s better than as-built new looks fabulous and can be driven anywhere without worry.

For diesel-electric locomotives resto-mods are best exemplified by what railroads like Union Pacific (UP) NS and Canadian Pacific are doing in place of investing in new power that can cost upward of $3 million each. For roughly half that investment they can obtain rebuilt upgraded units that deliver reliability fuel efficiency environmental benefits and longevity.

UP in late July selected Wabtec to modernize 600 locomotives in a deal worth more than $1 billion. This is Wabtec’s third major power-upgrade order from UP since 2018 covering more than 1030 locomotives upon completion in 2025.

Wabtec will upgrade 525 of UP’s AC4400 and AC6000s as well as 75 Dash-9s in what it called “the largest investment in modernized locomotives in rail industry history.” They will feature the FDL Advantage engine upgrade and Modular Control Architecture a next-generation controls technology that is said to be applicable throughout Wabtec’s locomotive installed base. The modernizations will not only extend locomotive life but also provide such benefits as a fuel efficiency improvement of up to 18%; a more-than 80% increase in reliability; and a haulage ability increase of more than 55% according to Wabtec. In addition Wabtec said each upgraded unit will eliminate approximately 350 tons of carbon per year and UP will realize approximately 210000 tons in annual emission reductions from the total modernization.

The work will take place at Wabtec’s U.S. plants with deliveries expected to begin in 2023. The manufacturer said 70000 tons of steel would be reused and recycled “which is the equivalent of more than 51000 passenger cars.”

For Wabtec the order is a bonanza. “We estimate that the agreement with UP could mean $360 million of revenue per year for Wabtec for the next three years” said Cowen and Company Transportation Analyst Matt Elkott. “At least 60% of that could be incremental to expectations resulting in incremental annual revenues of at least $216 million for 2023-2025 and annual incremental EPS accretion percentage in the high single digits to low teens. We note that modernizations are about half the revenue of a new locomotive for Wabtec but at much higher margins. As the North American new-build market is likely to continue to be anemic we expect modifications strength to continue with more Class I’s possibly signing new agreements. Wabtec is the largest freight locomotive builder followed by Caterpillar (Progress Rail/EMD). The two form an effective duopoly in North America.”



The EMD® 710ECO™ Repower locomotive series is equipped with an EM2000™ Microprocessor Control System and an 8- or 12-cylinder EMD® 710 prime-mover. EMD photo

Like Wabtec Progress Rail has entered the repower market full-force offering four units: the EMD® 24B Repower T-4 30C 20B and 710ECO™. They all “can be tailored for customer installation” or delivered as “complete turnkey solutions using the latest generation of EMD® or Cat® engines and a choice of control systems.”

Progress Rail describes the 24B as “an EMD® GP-style locomotive powered by a Cat® 3512C HD 12-cylinder engine and Kato alternator. Designed with flexibility in mind this unit allows customers to choose options without extensive engineering. It utilizes rebuilt GP-style trucks with rebuilt D78 traction motors and has been constructed with a new crashworthy underframe cab and fuel tank.” SCR and DPF exhaust aftertreatment provide Tier 4 emisions compliance.

The six-axle 30C features a 3005-hp Cat® 3516C-HD 16-cylinder engine and rebuilt D77 traction motors. Built on an EPA Tier 2 emissions basis optional exhaust aftertreatment bumps up compliance to Tier 3 with Tier 4 NOx. Progress Rail claims 5%-15%-plus fuel savings vs. comparable originally equipped locomotives. The four-axle 20B like the 24B is a GP-style locomotive. It’s equipped with a Cat® 3512C HD engine Kato alternator rebuilt D78 traction motor and EM2000™ including AESS™ (Automatic Engine Start Stop). It’s rated at 2100 hp.

The 710ECO™ Repowers “extend locomotive life for up to 40 years and lower life cycle costs by equipping older models with EMD® 710 engines” Progress Rail notes. Available with Tier 3-compliant 8-710G3A-T3 (8-cylinder) or 12-710G3A-T3 (12-cylinder) engines they feature a separate loop aftercooling system EM2000™ Microprocessor Control System and AESS™.

Urban Catalyst successfully closed its first OZ Fund in December 2020 with $131 million. Urban Catalyst Opportunity Zone Fund II is currently open to investors. Both funds are investing in downtown San Jose with projects that include multifamily (Icon/Echo) student housing (The Mark) senior living (Gifford Place) and offices and entertainment venues (Paseo).

“Our funds offer the opportunity to be a part of great projects in one of the strongest real estate markets in the country” said Erik Hayden Founder of Urban Catalyst. “This is something that has proven to be very attractive to investors.”

Investing in downtown San Jose

Downtown San Jose is in the midst of a major transformation with companies like Google Apple and Adobe collectively investing billions of dollars to expand there. Public infrastructure is being built out as well highlighted by the ongoing development of the Diridon train station which will ultimately connect to BART and bring high speed rail access to the city.

The San Jose real estate market has continued to show strength across property types. Multifamily occupancy rates stood at 95.4% in April according to Multihousing News while office vacancy rates were recently in the 9-10% range well below that of neighboring San Francisco and that of the U.S. generally.

“San Jose has always been a terrific place to live and is increasingly a great place to work too as more and more companies and people are discovering” said Morgan Mackles EVP of Investor Relations at Urban Catalyst. “That makes it a great place to build and invest as well.”

An investment in a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund like Urban Catalyst allows individuals to defer paying capital gains taxes on the sale of certain assets including stock a business or real estate.

A recognized leader in Opportunity Zone (OZ) fundraising Urban Catalyst ranked in the top 5% of all OZ funds tracked by Novogradac. Just 42 of the 1500 Opportunity Zones tracked raised more than $150 million.

Northrop Grumman built first MQ-4C Triton for Australia

Northrop Grumman Corporation has unveiled the first Australian autonomous MQ-4C Triton UAV.

The corporation said that Australia is a joint partner in the Triton program and played a crucial role in shaping the requirements for the system.

Northrop Grumman began assembling the first Australian MQ-4C in October 2020 at its Moss Point manufacturing facility in Mississippi.

Triton would provide the Royal Australian Air Force with unprecedented capabilities to monitor and protect shipping lanes.

The drone will operate alongside the P-8A Poseidon marine aircraft and this unmanned aircraft system will cover significant areas over long distances and will be able to stay airborne longer than a traditional aircraft.

In June 2018 the Prime Minister of Australia announced that Australia would acquire 6 Triton UAVs for the RAAF. In 2020 it became known that Australia would order additional drones of this type.

The first of which is scheduled to be adopted in mid-2023.

The total cost of purchasing building infrastructure and providing support is unofficially estimated at $7 billion.

The long-duration high-altitude MQ-4C Triton drone is the marine version of the Northrop Grumman-developed RQ-4N Block 30 Global Hawk drone.

It is designed for surveillance and reconnaissance and is equipped with a multifunctional radar with an AN/ZPY-3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) and radio reconnaissance.

Wingspan MQ-4C – 39.9 m (130.9 ft) length – 14.5 m (47.6 ft) maximum takeoff weight — 14628 kg weight of internal payload – 1252 kg weight of payload on external suspension — 1089 kg.

The cruise line has removed the need to go to certain restaurants to enjoy their free dinner with a bottle of wine and made this option apply to more specialty restaurants.

The restrictions to where dinner coupons can be used have been an eyesore for many guests making the Freestyle cruising that Norwegian offers somewhat restrictive.

Latitude Dinner Program Now Available In More Locations

Norwegian Cruise Line which recently launched its newest cruise ship Norwegian Prima has made some changes to its Lattitudes rewards loyalty program which was in effect from September 14 2022.

Where guests would have been restricted previously to enjoy their ‘Dinner for Two with a Bottle of Wine’ perk in either Cagney’s or Le Bistro this has now been expanded to include all restaurants with a complimentary wine list.

The Dinner for Two option previously only available to be used at Moderno or La Cucina can now be used for dinner at La Cucina Food Republic Q Texas Smokehouse Teppanyaki American Diner and more. Both dining options are only available on sailings of five days or longer and entitles each guest to an appetizer one entrée and dessert of choice.

In a letter sent to guests the cruise line said the following: “We have also increased the flexibility of our Latitude dinner vouchers! You may now use your first voucher towards a dinner for two at Cagney’s Le Bistro or Ocean Blue which will include a free bottle of wine. The second voucher can now be redeemed at La Cucina Food Republic. Q Texas Smokehouse Teppanyaki or American Diner.”

The two free dinner coupons become available to all guests who reach the Platinum tier of the loyalty program as well as the Sapphire Diamond and Ambassador Tiers.

The restrictive nature of the program previously has been an eyesore to many guests mainly as Norwegian Cruise Line has been the pioneer in freestyle cruising marketing heavily towards a dine anywhere anytime culture. Norwegian will certainly satisfy demand with the new rules regarding the free specialty dining options.

Other additions to the newly released benefits are one free Flow water carton from the Gold tier and two free cartons from the Sapphire tier and the Unlimited Open Bar Package Discount. The open bar package includes discounts of 30% for Brons members through to 50% discount for all Diamond and Ambassador members.

Not Everything is Back to Normal Yet

The changes Norwegian Cruise Line has implemented for the Lattitudes Loyalty program also come with bad news. For now NCL is not returning the Behind the Scenes ship tour and the Dinner with officers.

“In order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and crew members we have suspended the Behind-the-Scenes Ship Tour and Dinner with the Officers. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank you for your support and understanding.”

These perks are usually offered to all guests with Platinum status for the Behind the Scenes tour and a Sapphire status for dinner with officers.

Guests automatically enroll in the Lattitude rewards program when they first cruise with Norwegian. Besides dining and beverage rewards the program has many more benefits that guests can enjoy such as discounts in duty-free shops onboard discounts on excursions and photos laundry service and even a free seven-day cruise once they reach ambassador status.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wYWxtLXRyZWVzLW5lYXItaG9sbHl3b29kLWJvd2wtMTczMzMxNjYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palm Trees Near the Hollywood Bowl Catch Fire Following Sound of Music Sing-along,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wYWxtLXRyZWVzLW5lYXItaG9sbHl3b29kLWJvd2wtMTczMzMxNjYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394F6549D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

EVGA will still offer its award-winning PSUs (power supplies) and the rest of the product lines.

What Do We Think?

EVGA dropping NVIDIA will put a big hole in NVIDIA’s North American sales of AIBs where EVGA enjoyed 40% market share and put a dent in Western Europe sales due to the many EVGA fans in that region. NVIDIA can overcome that by adjusting the allocation levels for the remaining AIB partners as well as direct sales through Best Buy but it will take a quarter or two. Given the inventory overhang partners and NVIDIA are experiencing there seems to be no rush.

The elephant-in-the-room question is: “Will EVGA pick up AMD or Intel GPUs?” Either company would be delighted to add the EVGA brand to its partner list. However the CEO and Founder of EVGA Andrew Han has expressed a desire to slow down a bit and spend more time with his family. The AIB business is truly a 24/7 pressure cooker and after 22 years it’s starting to take its toll. However physicist trained entrepreneur Han may just need a short recharge period; he’s not taken a vacation in years.

Han told NVIDIA in June of his decision so this isn’t news nor comes as a shock to NVIDIA. But it’s a tectonic shift in the channel and the gamer community. Gamers weren’t the only ones who valued EVGA’s high-quality AIBs. Content creators financial advisors and hedge-fund managers also were dedicated buyers.

Financially it will reduce EVGA’s total revenue but the company will increase its profits by escaping the margin squeeze from AIBs. Han has said he has no interest in selling the company. Ironically when the 4000 series does come out it will require many end-users and most OEMs to increase the size of their PSUs—and guess who has an answer for “Where can I get one?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVkZXZlbG9wZXIuY29tL2dhbWUtcGxhdGZvcm1zL2V2Z2EtZW5kcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLWFuZC1pdHMtbnZpZGlhLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA ends production of graphics cards and its NVIDIA partnership,"PC component maker EVGA announced on Friday it'll no longer be making next-gen graphics cards and in fact is getting out of graphics cards entirely as its longtime partnership with NVIDIA is coming to an end. In separate interviews with JayZTwoCents and Gamers Nexus that were spotted by Tom's Hardware CEO Andrew Han alleged NVIDIA had gradually eroded the relationship between the two companies.



""EVGA will not carry the next generation graphics cards"" it wrote on its forums. It added that it would continue to support and sell ""existing current generation products.""

NVIDIA is one of the hardware pillars of the video game industry and Han's allegations are a serious claim about how the company does business.

Han alleged that NVIDIA failed to provide EVGA information about products like the RTX 3080 graphics card. EVGA's own high end cards for the RTX 3080 and 3090 he added had to be sold at a loss of ""hundreds of dollars"" so as to be competitive with NVIDIA's Founders Edition cards.

EVGA creates various PC components such as motherboards and power supplies. It's also been a partner with NVIDIA for years producing GeForce and RTX 30-series video cards.



A spokesperson for NVIDIA released a statement stating it ""had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products. We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.""

Senior management for EVGA elected to finally terminate its partnership with NVIDIA back in April according to Han. The component maker will remain in business its staff will be reallocated to different projects to avoid layoffs. The company is expected to run out of stock for its RTX 30-series cards by year's end with extra stock being held onto for the purpose of service and repairs.

It's hard to blame EVGA for its decision to leave the graphics card market. Between supply chain issues with the RTX 3080 and similar cards plus graphics cards being used to mine cryptocurrency the graphics card market has been incredibly messy in recent years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtdHNtYy1ydXNoLW9yZGVycy1iZWZvcmUtY2hpbmEtc2FuY3Rpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Reportedly Asks TSMC to Rush Lucrative GPU Orders Before US-China Sanctions Bite,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.tomshardware.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/nvidia-tsmc-rush-orders-before-china-sanctions (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FFB2200>, 'Connection to www.tomshardware.com timed out.

It follows reports from YouTube channels Gamers Nexus and JayZTwoCents that suggested Nvidia was a poor partner to work with. EVGA CEO Andrew Han apparently said the software maker stopped giving it information about new product announcements and suggested retail pricing and availability before being publicly revealed making planning a challenge. Nvidia also reportedly undercut the prices of partners like EVGA with its own Founders Edition cards which pushed EVGA to sell at a loss to remain competitive.

""We've had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products"" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement emailed to CNET. ""We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.""

Randy Brett Lee 52 of Howey-in-the-Hills was arrested Thursday and charged with grand theft of more than $10000 and scheme to defraud of more than $50000. He bonded out of Lake County Jail hours later for $35000 and will appear in Lake County Court on Oct. 10.

Infotrac Inc. located at 200 N. Palmetto St. is a hazardous material response and compliance company. According to the probable cause affidavit Lee was employed by the company for more than 25 years and most recently was director of marketing. He entered into a five-year self-renewing contract in 2011 that paid him $165000 per year and established commission criteria. Lee’s job was to bring in new clients and renew existing clients. With the significant increase in salary certain sales were no longer eligible for commissions.

Lee was in the second year of his second renewal in April when the company president was made aware of an email from Lee authorizing 12.5 percent commission payments to two other employees for helping Lee during an extended absence for a chronic medical condition. The president said he didn’t know anything about the additional funds being paid to the employees and never approved the payments the affidavit said.

This triggered an internal investigation of company practices and procedures and the company president reviewed company reports according to the affidavit.

Under the contract Lee received commission for new accounts but not for renewals. The investigation discovered that Lee would review the renewal list every month highlight various accounts and have the accounting team to change them to new accounts because the clients planned to cancel before he “saved” them the affidavit said.

The investigation also showed that Lee would regularly receive company income reports highlight certain accounts and add handwritten percentages next to them to indicate what he wanted added to his commissions. The company president said he never authorized these handwritten percentages as additional commissions according to the affidavit.

The investigation continued and more layers to the scheme were uncovered. In early May the company president called Lee and asked him about three accounts and Lee replied that he couldn’t say until he saw the accounts. Later that day Lee was observed taking items off his office walls and packing up his belongings. When asked what he was doing Lee said he was taking a 10-day PTO. The president asked who takes items off the walls when going on a 10-day PTO and Lee said “I won’t quit! You will have to fire me!” the affidavit said.

The company president told Lee he had no intention of firing him at that time. He took Lee to lunch and they discussed FMLA and short-term disability related to Lee’s chronic condition. They returned to the office Lee left and never returned to work. The president said he hasn’t seen Lee since then according to the affidavit.

Meanwhile the accounting manager reported that Lee had made it known that he was “untouchable.” She said she was warned by the previous accounting manager to “play the game” and not to do anything to upset Lee. The accounting manager said she heard about other employees who went against Lee and were either no longer with the company or treated badly if they remained. She said she was intimidated by Lee and tried to avoid conflict and confrontation the affidavit said.

The accounting manager said on May 2 after Lee was questioned by the president and vice president about his activities Lee walked by her office and called her a “(expletive deleted) bitch.” He later denied making the comment and started clearing out his office according to the affidavit.

Multiple other employees provided information about Lee’s fraudulent activities. An audit showed Lee took approximately $400000 in unauthorized unearned salary between 2018 and 2022 the affidavit said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jbGV2ZWxhbmQvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L3NhdWN5LWJyZXctd29ya3Mtc29sZC1pbi1pbmRlcGVuZGVuY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gray Media buys site from Saucy Brew Works finalizing move out of downtown Cleveland - Cleveland Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland/news/2022/09/19/saucy-brew-works-sold-in-independence.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jbGV2ZWxhbmQvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L3NhdWN5LWJyZXctd29ya3Mtc29sZC1pbi1pbmRlcGVuZGVuY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9vbGQtYnJpZGdlLW5qLXdvbWFuLWZvdW5kLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1vd24taG9tZS1wcm9zZWN1dG9yLXNheXMtZGVib3JhaC1zb25uaS1icm93bi1oZXB3b3J0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Bridge NJ woman found killed in home months after husband's death,"OLD BRIDGE — A woman was found killed in her township home officials said Monday.

Diego Malacad Secretary General of United Negros Drivers and Operators Center (UNDOC) said that they have been anticipating the fare increase after the series of price hikes on petroleum products especially diesel which is mostly used by Public Utility Vehicles.



Malacad said the fare hike would be implemented in October adding that they don't need to go to the LTFRB to get the fare matrix.



Instead they can download it through the social media page of the LTFRB he stressed.



Under the new minimum fare jeepney passengers will now need to pay the minimum fare of P12 from the current P11 or an additional P1.80 for every kilometer.



The adjustment is lower by P2 than the actual fare increase earlier sought by jeepney operators.



For modern jeepneys the board also granted a P1 fare hike increasing the current P13 minimum to P14 which was P2 lower than what the petitioners wanted.



Passengers will also have to pay P2.20 per additional kilometer from the current P1.80.



As to buses the regulatory body approved a P2 increase in the uniform base fare which applies to both city and provincial operations and covers the first 5 kilometers.



For ordinary buses the board increased the minimum fare to P13 (from P11) while it will be P15 (from P13) for air-conditioned city buses.



The new per-kilometer rate for ordinary buses is P2.25 (from P1.85) and for air-conditioned buses P2.65 (from P2.20).



Ordinary provincial buses may now charge P11 as minimum fare from the current P9. The adjustment was P4 lower than what the transport groups petitioned.



The per-kilometer rate for deluxe provincial buses is now P2.10 (from P1.75); super deluxe buses P2.35 (from P1.95); and luxury provincial buses P2.90 (from P2.40)."

The one that got away

Virginia quarterback Brennan Armstrong looks to throw against Old Dominion during a game Saturday in Charlottesville.

Old Dominion silenced the crowd and just needed a stop to escape Charlottesville with a victory over Virginia — and a sweep of the state’s ACC teams.

But Cavaliers QB Brennan Armstrong showed why he’s U.Va.’s all-time leading passer guiding the offense down the field for a game-winning field goal as time expired. Final: Virginia 16 ODU 14.

ODU’s go-ahead touchdown shushed the 40000-plus mostly orange-clad fans at Scott Stadium but those same fans rejoiced a few minutes later.

ODU comes home for a Saturday Sun Belt opener against Arkansas State (1-2).

Hudson + Champ = Awwwww

Hudson left and Champ met Saturday afternoon at Scott Stadium when Old Dominion played Virginia.

They came they met they panted. Hudson ODU’s service dog and his counterpart at U.Va. Champ met up before kickoff Saturday and social media swooned. The full story.

Pirates’ treasure

Hampton University head coach Robert Prunty meets with Norfolk State University coaches after the conclusion of the game. Hampton University defeated Norfolk State University 17-7 at Norfolk State University in Norfolk Virginia on Sept. 17 2022.

Hampton University is 3-0 and the Pirates are picking up steam heading into their Colonial Athletic Association opener this week at Delaware.

On Saturday HU outlasted Norfolk State 17-7 in the Battle of the Bay and Pirates coach Robert Prunty has his best start since taking over before the 2018 season.

Prunty has stocked his roster with a mix of players from the transfer portal — LB Qwahsin Townsel a transfer from Villanova had a team-leading eight tackles Saturday — and HU veterans led by star WR Jadakis Bonds. The defense was spectacular against NSU.

Also in college football on Saturday:

William & Mary stayed unbeaten with a road victory against Lafayette.

Christopher Newport hosted Apprentice School in the first meeting of the programs and the Builders came out on top.

Virginia Tech tuned up for Thursday night’s showdown against WVU with a win over Wofford.

Under the Friday night lights

Churchland receiver Ky’nique Baines right celebrates with teammate Trevell Brown left after Baines scored a touchdown against Booker T. Washington in the second quarter of a game at Churchland High School on Friday.

Churchland ran past Booker T. Washington in an Eastern District showdown on Friday night in Portsmouth.

Across the HRBT Menchville busted out of a nearly 30-year slump against Hampton on Friday with a 21-20 come-from-behind victory.

The Crabbers are rebuilding under first-year coach Woodrow Wilson but the Monarchs had not secured a win in the series since 1993.

“It was awesome” Menchville coach Rodney Taylor said. “The guys showed resilience by fighting back. Our defense stiffened and we were able to get the ball in the end zone.”

Commissioned for the 9Network Australia and filmed in 4K the 8-part series follows the heart-warming stories of the staff volunteers and animals that come through the doors of the Animal Welfare League of South Australia Inc. (AWL) and Vets4Pets Emergency Hospital in Adelaide.



Production is by Context Media with production funding from Omnicom Media Group subsidiary OMnet Australia. Escapade Media is on board to handle international distribution and says that it is close to announcing a raft of licensing deals.



“This is a brilliant paring. Jai Courtney relates to the mass demographic but with a solid appeal to the younger demographic which is essential for channels and platforms today” said Natalie Lawley MD of Escapade.



Popular on Variety

Courtney (“A Good Day to Die Harf” “Terminator Genisys”) was most recently seen in Prime Video’s action thriller series “The Terminal List” alongside Chris Pratt. He will next be seen in Netflix series “Jigsaw” a heist action drama from Ridley Scott. The tough guy however turns out to be a pet lover.



“ ‘For the Love of Pets’’ is a fascinating look into the lives of some very special people and the endless amount of love and dedication they pour into their crusade to get thousands of helpless animals the love and care they deserve every year” said Courtney. “We get an understanding of just how much work goes into running these facilities and charitable organizations the resources they require and the kinds of people it takes to uphold the level of care it demands. Some of the animals we meet need lifesaving surgeries some just a loving home. But it’s a dramatic day-to-day operation sometimes heart-breaking but often full of joy and fulfilment.”



“As an actor Jai has great range which he brings to the narration of ‘For the Love of Pets” adding powerfully to the dramatic and emotive moments as well as an ability to lighten and brighten the storytelling with the sense of fun and joy” said Peter Jenetsky Context Media MD and executive producer of the show.

First launched last year the ‘F-list 2021’ highlighted over 90 agencies with fossil fuel clients on their books. This year the research was extended to include a greater focus on Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions showcasing the agencies actively under contract with the fossil fuel industry and taking this year’s running total up to 239 agencies.

The F-List 2022 scrutinizes sustainability statements from some of adland’s leading firms including WPP Omnicom Interpublic Group (IPG) Publicis Groupe Dentsu Edelman and Havas and compares them with the records of their clients.

Clean Creatives claims that while the report found that most agencies have erased references to fossil fuel clients from their websites its research teams were able to use web archives to uncover the links despite the sustainability commitments and net zero pledges most have made.

The report comes the same week as congressional democrats in the US held a hearing to discuss the role PR firms have played in blocking climate action and their contributions to the ”deceptive” and ”misleading” tactics used in their campaigns.

Within the advertising industry the movement against agencies working with ’dirty’ clients is growing. At this year’s Cannes Lions the complicated relationship took center-stage after ex-adman turned activist Gustav Martner interrupted the opening ceremony to hand back the Lions award he had won for his work with Volkswagen. Protests continued throughout the week as Greenpeace campaigners stormed WPP’s beach takeover and scaled the Palais (a central location in the city) to decry adland’s failure to sever ties with big oil.

The impact of advertising on the social license for major polluters to operate is now being addressed through policy. France recently became the first country to implement a fossil fuel advertising ban with companies facing a fine of up to €100000 ($100000) if they are in breach of the rules. Meanwhile Sydney Australia became the first urban center in APAC to do the same.

Here are the key findings

The 239 agencies from major industry holding companies and independent companies have recently worked with fossil fuel companies the report said. The vast majority of this work is not shared via agency channels.

At least 17 agencies are working for Saudi Aramco the world’s largest polluter. Interpublic Mediabrands agency Well7 and fellow IPG agencies McCann UM and Jack Morton all led substantial work for Aramco though all holding companies have some connection to the world’s largest oil company.

Coal giant Glencore is being referred to Australian regulators over its brand campaign that features EVs solar panels and wind turbines but doesn’t mention Glencore’s primary business – coal. This complaint follows the barring of two employees of Anacta Strategies from lobbying the Queensland government. Glencore secured a lucrative bailout while employing Anacta.

Edelman retains its role as the independent agency doing the most work for fossil fuel companies despite a pledge in early 2022 to review its client policy. Some small signs of progress at the PR giant can be seen but the company remains committed to working with polluters.

“Advertising and PR companies have had decades of warnings that their relationships with fossil fuel companies are harming their reputation and their clean clients“ says Clean Creatives’ executive director Duncan Meisel. ”Until now executives have chosen to ignore those warnings with serious consequences for the planet and their ability to attract and retain young talent.”

Recent research by Glimpse surveyed the attitudes of 100 UK creatives aged 18 to 30 and found that 63% said they were uncomfortable working on high-carbon clients.

Unsurprisingly the ad industry’s holding companies and major groups also feature prominently on the list.

WPP declined to comment on its inclusion but chief exec Mark Read recently told The Drum it had no plans to sever ties with Big Oil stating: ”In my view there’s no one solution to this. Yes energy companies are selling oil. But as consumers we’re all driving cars and flying in places. It requires a collective solution. Our industry should play a role in doing that – not to misrepresent what they are doing but if we can talk about what they’re doing in a fair and accurate way why wouldn’t we want to do that?”

The Drum also reached out to Interpublic (IPG) Ominicom Publicis Groupe and Dentsu but they had not responded at the time of publication.

The revival of interest in Japan’s semiconductor industrial policy reflects not only recent legislation meant to ensure long-term growth of the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry but also the potential for new alliances to strengthen supply chains and address strategic challenges from China.



The history of Japan's semiconductor industry can be divided into three phases: the rise of Japanese semiconductor companies from the 1970s to the 1980s their gradual decline from the 1990s to the 2000s and a period of renewed national attention paid to Japan's semiconductor industry from the 2000s to the present.



The Rise of Japanese Semiconductor Companies: 1970s-1980s



Japan’s global market share of semiconductor manufacturing and other sectors of the semiconductor industry including chip design materials and manufacturing equipment gradually grew from the 1960s to the 1980s. Coinciding with a dramatic increase in domestic demand for semiconductors used in consumer electronics the government made efforts to establish Japan as a leader across all domains of the chip sector. According to a report published by Osaka Keizai University along with soaring private investment into the sector the 1970s and 1980s was a period of international competitiveness and success for the Japanese semiconductor industry.



Japanese industrial policy helped semiconductor companies gain global market share. Notably funding for research and development (R&D) in semiconductor manufacturing equipment grew to 26 percent of Japan's total R&D spending in 1977 up from just 2 percent at the beginning of the 1970s according to a report published by Ritsumeikan Business School.





In addition the Japanese government invested $300 million towards the establishment of a public-private joint technology research project called the Super LSI Technology Research Association with Japan's six main computer companies: Fujitsu Hitachi NEC Mitsubishi Electric NTT and Toshiba in 1976. Together these companies managed a joint laboratory in Japan's Kanagawa prefecture that focused solely on researching fundamental technology for semiconductors and avoiding technology leakage to competitors. As a separate project two other laboratories conducted advanced and applied research on design and device technology among smaller subsections of the industry.



This joint research project featuring collaboration among rival companies contributed to the development of a common technology platform for companies to work collaboratively and share information to drive innovation. Beyond the six companies originally involved in the research consortium other Japanese companies involved in producing equipment and raw materials for semiconductor manufacturing also joined Super LSI Technology Research Association projects. This resulted in the development of a wide variety of new inventions related to semiconductor design and manufacturing.



After four years of collaborative work the Association developed the technique of electron beam lithography (EBL) a revolution in chip-making equipment technology which paved the way for the manufacturing of even more complex semiconductors at scale. EBL was eventually commercialized by ASML Nikon Corporation and Canon Inc. This technological leap helped facilitate Japanese dominance in the global semiconductor market with Japanese firms accounting for 51 percent of worldwide sales by 1988.



The Decline of Japan’s Semiconductor Industry: 1990s-2000s



U.S.-Japan Trade Friction

As Japan entered a period of economic dynamism in the 1970s U.S. policymakers began to see Japan as a growing market competitor. Specifically there was a concern among American policy makers that export-subsidized Japanese firms were ""dumping"" chips and consumer electronics into the U.S. market in an attempt to crowd out U.S. domestic firms while denying foreign access to the Japanese domestic market. Amid growing dissatisfaction in the U.S. with perceived unfair trade practices from Japanese industry the United States began pushing for trade concessions from the Japanese government. The Japanese concerned over the risk of being shut out from the U.S. market entirely made concessions under the U.S. Japan Semiconductor Agreement in 1986.



The agreement gave the U.S. government the authority to set minimum fair market prices for chips in the U.S. while also increasing the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market from 10 percent to 20 percent. These two stipulations simultaneously eroded Japanese competitiveness in foreign as well as its own semiconductor market and enabled semiconductor companies in the U.S. South Korea and other countries to gain most of the world semiconductor market share.



Japan’s Failure to Adapt

By the late 1990s the dominant business model for the semiconductor industry was shifting in most countries from vertically integrated firms which both designed and manufactured semiconductors towards highly-specialized firms which either designed or manufactured chips. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the first ‘pure-play’ foundry business founded in 1987 began the industry’s march towards specialization.



The Japanese government led several initiatives in the 1990s-2000s to encourage companies to transition towards specialization arguing that firms should curb their duplicative investment in manufacturing infrastructure and move their excess capacity to strengthening high-value design capabilities. In 2001 the Japanese government allocated more than $300 million to establish the Hinomaru Foundry a joint domestic fabrication facility involving 11 companies which aimed to shift Japan's semiconductor industry from a vertical integration model to a fabless model.



There were also several government initiatives which attempted to advance Japanese leadership in design and manufacturing technology for new generations of smaller more advanced semiconductors such as the ""ASKA"" Project for the 65 nanometer (nm) generation of semiconductors or the ""MIRAI Project"" which targeted process technology for the 45nm generation in addition to other initiatives.



However many Japanese semiconductor firms were unable or unwilling to adapt to emerging trends in the global industry. One of the reasons why Japanese semiconductor companies lost their competitiveness is that sales of digital products in Japan were stagnant which in turn meant that they had less capital to invest in research and development activities. With less capital to invest firms were disincentivized from divesting from any of their high-revenue departments (e.g. a semiconductor design operations) even if doing so could lead to greater profits in another department. This undermined efforts to incentivize the transition towards specialization.



Also the Japanese government’s promotion of joint initiatives although initially beneficial to the semiconductor industry eventually diminished diversity among Japanese semiconductor manufacturers due to the standardization of their technology and the leveling of technology among their companies. This resulted in an industrial structure that made it difficult for companies to adapt to changes in the competitive environment.



The post-Decline Period: 2000s-Today



Responding to the relative decline of Japan’s semiconductor industry the Japanese government has renewed its efforts to encourage the nation’s semiconductor industry towards a more globally competitive business model.



In December 2005 the government called on Hitachi Toshiba and Renesas to build joint advanced process semiconductor foundries for the 65nm generation of semiconductors meaning that these three semiconductor companies would share a single fabrication plant. Instead of each company having their own fabrication plant under the traditional vertical business model the three companies tried to organize their resources so that each could specialize in a specific step of the manufacturing process. However the three companies concluded that the fabrication could not be commercialized and ended this project in 2006.



More recently Japanese government agency officials members of Prime Minister Kishida’s cabinet and Diet representatives have been working to address this issue. In 2021 the government approved $7.7 billion in funding as part of a strategy to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing at home.



Conclusion



From the 1970s to the 2000s Japan’s semiconductor industry experienced three distinct periods each with its own policy legacy. During the 1970s-1980s Japan established technological superiority and was the world’s leader but its success declined due to a combination of factors including trade friction with the U.S. and shifts in global semiconductor market trends.



Understanding Japan’s policy successes and failures in the semiconductor manufacturing industry is of value to U.S. policymakers as they work to implement the CHIPS and Science Act and as they collaborate with their Japanese Taiwanese and South Korean allies through various economic and trade initiatives to bolster strategic supply chains.

Explore the report

As the global semiconductor shortage drags on every tech executive is asking the same question: When will it end? But the more salient question might be: When will my company get relief?

The reality is the chip crunch probably won’t end on a single date. Many disruptive factors continue to dog semiconductor supply chains—acute events such as Covid-19 lockdowns and extreme weather that lead to short-term operational disruptions as well as structural supply chain weaknesses that have caused shortages of “leading-edge” 12-inch wafers with transistors of 28 to 130 nanometers “lagging-edge” 6- and 8-inch wafers and advanced substrates for “bleeding-edge” chips with transistors of 5 to 14 nanometers. Each has its own timeline to resolution. As a result some companies are starting to see relief this year while others may have to wait until 2024 or later (see Figure 1). At the same time several wild cards could cause more disruption including the global economy geopolitical tensions and shortages of equipment for manufacturing bleeding-edge chips.

Figure 1 Automotive and industrial companies are starting to see relief from chip shortages but advanced computing products remain in a challenging period

Many have followed how automotive companies cut back orders when Covid-19 hit only to find themselves at the back of the line for wafers when they later needed them. But the larger impact has come from skyrocketing demand for technology products and the long lead times required to build the fabrication plants that supply their chips has led to a chip shortage that has often played out unevenly but has affected nearly every end market in some way.

Some chip types (and the industries that rely on them) have been hit harder and at different times. After shooting up in 2021 lead times for chip deliveries have flattened at elevated levels in recent months (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 After spiking in 2021 semiconductor delivery times flattened at elevated levels

These shortages will improve faster for certain products and industries depending on the types of chips they use but more tech executives are recognizing that the next phase of the shortage will be like the arcade game Whac-A-Mole. As one shortage recedes giving affected chip buyers all the computing components needed to produce a complete product those buyers will start to consume chip supplies in another area causing new shortages to pop up.

Three wild cards will determine how the shortage plays out.

Demand pullback. Unfortunately the fastest route to relief is softening demand. Inconceivable for the past 2 ½ years this now seems a distinct possibility given the economic outlook. There are already reports of tech companies temporarily pausing new component orders and asking suppliers to delay or shrink shipments amid inflation worries and growing inventories.

Shortages of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment. These $150-million-a-pop machines are necessary to build bleeding-edge fabrication plants and there’s only one supplier ASML. This bottleneck will likely grow over the next three years or so potentially constraining capacity and limiting new plant openings at a time when semiconductor makers plan to spend well over $150 billion on new bleeding-edge production facilities (see Figure 3).

This bottleneck will likely grow over the next three years or so potentially constraining capacity and limiting new plant openings at a time when semiconductor makers plan to spend well over $150 billion on new bleeding-edge production facilities (see Figure 3). Geopolitical frictions. The semiconductor supply chain has become a major strategic asset in geopolitical maneuverings and not just in China and the West. This year Russia limited exports of noble gases including neon a crucial ingredient in chipmaking. That followed Japan’s 2019 restriction of exports to South Korea of high-purity hydrogen fluoride an etching gas used in semiconductor manufacturing. Growing tensions between China and the US threaten to further bifurcate the global technology ecosystems. The US has already cut off China from receiving advanced tools and domestic-first policies in China may make it difficult for Western firms to access lagging-edge chips from China where there’s a concentration of lagging-edge wafer manufacturing hubs coming online. And these are just a few of the reasons that semiconductor consumers will need to increasingly consider geopolitical risks when sourcing their chips.

These wild cards are largely out of tech executives’ control but companies can take several pragmatic steps to protect themselves against chip shortages and the myriad disruptions to electronics supply chains that are undoubtedly coming.

Design products for flexible resilience. Leading companies constantly refine their products to increase resilience ideally beginning early in product development and before a supply disruption hits. In our work with clients and analysis of the global landscape we’ve found that certain things consistently succeed: reducing a product’s number of parts reusing components using standard design approaches and flexible product architecture wherever possible and decoupling software from hardware. In a chip shortage for example the fewer “hooks” the product has into silicon the better.

Assess risks regularly. To help identify the next big supply crunch leading companies proactively and continuously assess risks across their entire supply chain and all scenarios they can imagine. After chasing parts for 18 months one global technology company recently stepped back to evaluate the potential magnitude and duration of a wide range of risks including those related to specific suppliers natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. This helped highlight where investment was most critical to shoring up supply chain resilience. To reduce its reliance on a single supplier for key components the company had to pay extra to keep multiple suppliers active and bring its procurement department into product development discussions earlier. As a result the company should be able to fulfill more orders during the next major component shortage potentially saving several hundred million dollars of revenue it would have otherwise lost.

Get closer to the semiconductor supply chain. In this era of increasingly frequent and intense supply disruptions traditional supply chain approaches won’t cut it. Many leading tech companies are developing closer relationships with their suppliers and the semiconductor ecosystem. Some are subsidizing suppliers’ production capacity in exchange for a guaranteed agreed-upon volume of product. Foxconn has gotten even more hands-on forming joint ventures to build chip fabs in India and Malaysia. Others are doing more semiconductor design in-house and developing new capabilities to do so.

Revamp the operating model. To pull all of this off leading companies are refreshing their operating model to improve collaboration among engineering sales and marketing and procurement—the teams critical to managing through and preparing for supply disruptions. For example these companies create rapid feedback mechanisms to help the three departments communicate better and prioritize the most important customer requests and the highest-value product redesign opportunities. They further strengthen these operational muscles by emphasizing cross-functional collaboration in their training programs.

After two years of chaos some tech companies are finally starting to see some relief from the chip shortage. The recovery will be choppy but leading companies are moving quickly to control what they can investing in supply chain resilience so they’re ready for whatever comes next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNmci5vcmcvYmxvZy9wb3RlbnRpYWwtZGVwZW5kZW5jeS1vdmVyc2lnaHQtdXMtc291dGgta29yZWEtY2hpcC1wb2xpY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Potential Dependency Oversight in U.S.-South Korea Chip Policy,"China is the world’s largest semiconductor consumer importing over $300 billion annually to support its technology sector. Overcoming this foreign dependency has been a top national priority. Under the State Council’s 2014 Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry China has been backing select companies with state-run funds including the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. Total Chinese government investments in the chip industry stand at around $50 billion. These efforts aim to meet the goals outlined in China’s Made in China 2025 policy: semiconductor self-sufficiency rate of 40 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2030.

China is not alone in pursuing ambitious industrial policies to support its semiconductor industry.

Policymakers in South Korea responded to the global semiconductor shortages throughout the past two years by passing the Special Act to Protect and Foster National High-Tech Strategic Industry which took effect on August 4 2022. Under the law firms producing designated “national high-tech items” including semiconductors will receive tax benefits regulatory easement and other preferential treatment to spur more research and development and increase production output. The National Assembly is now considering amendments to the Special Act to further expand benefits for the chip industry and semiconductor engineer training programs. It is important to note that South Korean government support for chipmakers predates this legislation. Private-public cooperation since the 1970s — notably through the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute — helped companies like Samsung and SK Hynix emerge as leading semiconductor firms today.

South Korean legislative effort will work in tandem with the multi-faced U.S.-South Korea semiconductor partnership and the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 9 that will provide $39 billion in domestic manufacturing incentives to chipmakers including South Korean firms.

In China benefactors of government subsidies – such as the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) – have been slowly catching up to their foreign competitors in manufacturing leading-edge chips.

SMIC now produces advanced 7-nanometer chips establishing them as one of the few makers of high-performance computing chips. Chips produced with smaller nodes — measured in nanometers— operate faster and more efficiently. In the flash memory sector YMTC has also obtained the capability to develop 232-layer 3D NAND chips a comparable technological feat to its global competitors as increased density achieved through stacking more horizontal layers of memory cells enables greater storage capacity.

In comparison Samsung — which has the second largest market share in contract chip manufacturing — recently started producing 3-nanometer chips two generations ahead of SMIC’s latest capability. SK Hynix holding the third largest market share in flash memory chips announced the development of the most advanced 3D NAND with 238-layers with plans to mass produce them early next year.

China remains far off from meeting its Made in China 2025 goals. In 2020 China produced around 16 percent of its domestic chip needs although the figure included production from foreign companies’ facilities in China. While that figure is expected to increase to 26 percent this year it is unlikely that indigenous capability will reach the 70 percent target by 2025.

The acquisition of technical knowledge of chip fabrication alone had presented a significant challenge for Chinese firms in meeting their self-sufficiency goals. U.S. export control measures however have quashed any immediate-term ambitions of Chinese semiconductor firms to compete in leading-edge chip manufacturing.

The United States has completely blocked Chinese firms and any foundries operating within China from accessing advanced lithography equipment including extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines needed to make chips beyond the 7-nanometer level and to efficiently produce DRAM chips. The United States is also reportedly contemplating sales restrictions on equipment from U.S.-based companies LAM Research Corporation and Applied Materials that are essential for making NAND chips with more than 128 layers.

China may be nearly two decades away from indigenously replicating the capabilities of EUV machines. The most advanced lithography machine made by a Chinese equipment company makes chip production at only the 90-nanometer node possible. Beyond the technical knowledge of producing equipment that pushes the limits of physics the need for highly specialized suppliers — such as the extremely flat mirrors from a German lens company exclusively provided to the Dutch manufacturer of the equipment — makes it unlikely that Chinese equipment companies will build advanced machines soon.

Shifting Gears

The success of U.S. measures to tightly control advanced chip-making may consequentially force China to double down on its ability to produce older and cheaper chips using mature technology and equipment. These “legacy” chips which have been in global short supply in the past two years are ubiquitously used in consumer electronics cars and small gadgets and are expected to account for 64 percent of global chip consumption in 2022.

New investments in advanced semiconductor production in China have largely been suspended while mature manufacturing capacity continues to grow. Chinese chipmakers have been aggressively increasing purchases of manufacturing equipment with orders rising by 58 percent in 2021 marking the second consecutive year that China has served as the biggest equipment market. With the United States blocking sales of EUV machines China-based firms purchased equipment such as older deep ultraviolet (DUV) and i-line machines both used for less advanced chip production. While the United States is debating restricting some DUV sales to China given its ability to be used to make 7-nanometer chips machines crucial for legacy chip production do not appear to be in the crosshairs of the U.S. export control regime.

Chinese semiconductor fabrication plants added 500000 wafers per month to the global supply of chips with nodes greater than 14-nanometers between September 2020 and November 2021. During this time China added only 10000 monthly capacities in more advanced chips. Additional legacy fabrication plants will be commencing operations in China soon. Last year SMIC notably announced plans to invest $8.87 billion in building China’s first gigafab for mature logic chips — a semiconductor fabrication plant with a capacity of at least 100000 wafer starts per month — in the Lingang Free Trade Zone.

Chinese foundries predominately producing 28-nanometer and older chips have already increased their market share to reach 10 percent for the first time in the first quarter of 2022. In the low-end memory chip sector analysts project that China will increase its global market share by up to 29 percent between 2020 and 2022.

Potential Legacy Chip Dependency

The current direction of semiconductor policy in the United States and South Korea appears to overlook the central driver of the growth of China’s semiconductor industry. This oversight could potentially exacerbate U.S. and South Korean reliance on China-made chips since semiconductor policies in both countries provide limited financial support for legacy chipmakers. The CHIPS Act in the United States has only $2 billion — out of the total $39 billion figure — earmarked for legacy chip production. U.S.-South Korea semiconductor cooperation also centers on advanced semiconductors: both countries seek to enact export controls to protect leading-edge technology and planned South Korean semiconductor plants in the United States will produce advanced chips.

Private sector investments have mirrored this trend. Most of the investments by leading U.S. and South Korean chip manufacturers are not intended for mature technologies cautious about heavily investing in plants producing chips that sell for lower profit rates and are vulnerable to severe price fluctuations. What investments these firms have made in legacy chips have gone to foundries in China: Samsung and SK Hynix for example expanded their legacy operations by adding capacity in their respective plants in Xian and Wuxi. As each chipmaker carefully assesses how to best utilize limited resources to construct multi-billion-dollar foundries and take advantage of targeted government subsidies a reversal of this investment trend appears unlikely.

Chinese companies will continue to invest more heavily in legacy chip production than their global competitors helping China get closer to the Made in China 2025 goals. At the same time control over an increasing portion of the legacy chip supply chains gives China additional leverage over the United States and South Korea at a time when global demand for chips with 28-nanometer or older nodes is expected to triple by 2030. China has so far been reluctant to launch punitive measures involving semiconductors as it remains highly dependent on foreign chip suppliers. However as China increases its foothold in the legacy semiconductor market — through a combination of increased investments in its indigenous capacity and increased output from foreign firms’ China operations — it may be willing to use chip exports as means to extract political concessions.

Maintaining control of the most advanced semiconductors will be crucial to checking Chinese economic and military ambitions and to ensure that the Chinese government-controlled firms do not frustrate either country’s technological innovation. But the intense focus on the leading-edge sector by the United States and South Korea — absent attention to growing Chinese capacity in legacy chip manufacturing — may open up an undesirable reliance on China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzaXMub3JnL2Jsb2dzL3BlcnNwZWN0aXZlcy1pbm5vdmF0aW9uL2phcGFuZXNlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wb2xpY3ltYWtpbmctdHdlbnR5LWZpcnN0LWNlbnR1cnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japanese Semiconductor Industrial Policymaking in the Twenty-First Century | Perspectives on Innovation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.csis.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /blogs/perspectives-innovation/japanese-semiconductor-industrial-policymaking-twenty-first-century (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FA4A950>, 'Connection to www.csis.org timed out.

Developer NewStreet Properties believes that the project over time will lure investment of up to $190 million.

The Gretna Logistics Park as the site is called is to kick off with construction of a 400000-square-foot warehouse. That structure will be a speculative build meaning tenants have yet to be secured.

Early plans also call for a second building that will stretch up to 300000 square feet and employ up to 200 workers. That employer is known but NewStreet declined to identify it yet as the sale of 25 acres for the assembly and production plant is still being finalized.

In all the broader development site could fit some 2 million square feet of industrial and warehouse building space for uses such as manufacturing and distribution said Peter Frei vice president of investments for NewStreet which bought the Sarpy County ground last year south of Interstate 80 off the Nebraska Crossing exit between Omaha and Lincoln.

The Gretna project signals continued strong demand for industrial projects that Frei believes will pick up in the region during the next five to 10 years. He said NewStreet wants to be ready when potential tenants come calling so as not to risk losing another business to a different city that has more move-in ready sites of that size.

“We think the tailwinds that the industrial market has been experiencing and that have been exacerbated by COVID will continue” he said.

‘A lot of dirt’

Construction on the first speculative warehouse will begin soon and likely be done in late 2023. NewStreet is so confident one or more users will come forth that they’re starting construction without any secured lease.

Frei said that there is a shortage of jumbo manufacturing and distribution spaces in the Omaha area and that suitable tracts of land on which to build them also are becoming scarcer.

Indeed much of the new and larger industrial space has sprouted nearer Sarpy County’s Papillion along or near Highways 50 and 370. But that growing area Frei said has become busier with traffic and area housing which is partly why NewStreet started looking for a development site near a different Interstate interchange.

His team found and bought the 170 acres of hilly farm ground near the open-air Nebraska Crossing mall. Land preparation was extensive he said requiring about one million cubic yards of dirt to be moved around to flatten the area.

“That’s a lot of dirt” he said.

All streets and utilities are to be installed by mid-2023. The developer created a sanitary improvement district to help fund public improvements.

The park is to be developed in two phases. The City of Gretna has approved necessary platting. The first building is to have a 36-foot height clearance and a cross docking feature that enhances speed flow and efficiency when dealing with certain inventories.

Boundaries are stretching

Dennis Sciscoe an industrial broker with the Cushman & Wakefield/Lund Co. is the listing agent and said the 400000-square-foot planned structure stands out as the area’s largest industrial-use property to be built on a speculative basis.

When all park phases are complete Sciscoe said the Gretna project would be the Omaha metro area’s largest contiguous industrial park.

“The boundaries of industrial development are pushing outward which is a good sign that our market is expanding” he said.

Other industrial parks are under construction in the metro area as well. R&R Realty of West Des Moines for example has been building a huge development in Sarpy County near Highways 370 and 50 that rivals the overall size envisioned at Gretna though the R&R property splits and is not contiguous.

Omaha developer White Lotus hopes to build about 1 million square feet of warehouse industrial space on 71 acres near Lincoln and also is developing the 138-acre I-80 Logistics Hub in Sarpy County at 132nd Street and Cornhusker Road.

A sample of tenants occupying I-80 Logistics: Amazon United Parcel Service Home Depot GXO Logistics Scooters.

The Opus Group plans to develop about 550000 square feet in Council Bluffs and said Sciscoe has leased a sizable chunk to Packaging Corp. of America.

The Omaha-Lincoln area offers attractive middle-America location and easy transportation access points Frei said. But he said he has known potential users who have flirted locally then turned elsewhere because of the shortage of readily available large spaces notably in the 300000- to 700000-square-foot range.

Last August cybersecurity company IronNet (IRNT) went public by merging with a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company). It initially attracted a lot of attention because its founder and co-CEO is Gen. Keith Alexander a retired four-star general who previously led the National Security Agency (NSA) the Central Security Service (CSS) and the U.S. Cyber Command.

IronNet's stock started trading at $13.44 after the merger and surged to an all-time high of $41.40 last September but now trades barely above the $1 mark. To understand why IronNet's stock collapsed let's review five bright red flags.

1. Falling short of premerger estimates

IronNet's platform uses AI-driven behavioral analytics and collective defense tools (which collect and share data across different sectors and companies) to shield organizations from cyberattacks. In its premerger presentation IronNet claimed its platform offered a ""fundamentally new layer of defense"" in the cybersecurity market.

But in its subsequent SEC filings IronNet admitted that it faces direct competition from similar network detection and response (NDR) service vendors including DarkTrace and Vectra Networks as well as diversified network security vendors including Cisco and Palo Alto Networks. All that competition seems to have prevented IronNet from achieving its lofty premerger growth targets.

During its investor presentation IronNet claimed that its revenue would rise 25% to $28.9 million in fiscal 2021 (which ended in January of the calendar year) grow 87% to $54.2 million in fiscal 2022 then surge 105% to $110.8 million in fiscal 2023.

In reality IronNet's revenue rose 26% to $29.2 million in fiscal 2021 but declined 6% to $27.5 million in fiscal 2022. Its revenue rose only 7% year over year to $13.3 million in the first half of fiscal 2023 and it withdrew its already whittled prior forecast for 25% revenue growth for the full year.

By comparison Palo Alto Networks expects its revenue to rise 25% to about $6.9 billion this year. It's generally a bright red flag when an underdog is growing at a slower rate than its much-larger competitor.

2. A loss of customers

IronNet ended fiscal 2022 with 88 customers. That number rose to 91 in the first quarter of 2023 yet dropped back to 78 in the second quarter. As a result its annual recurring revenue (ARR) declined from $31.8 million at the end of fiscal 2022 to just $26.5 million at the end of first half of 2023.

3. Plunging margins and widening losses

During its SPAC presentation IronNet claimed its gross margins would climb from 71.2% in fiscal 2020 to 74.7% in fiscal 2023. Its gross margin rose to 76% in fiscal 2021 but subsequently dropped to 65.9% in fiscal 2022 and 62.5% in the first half of fiscal 2023. For reference Palo Alto ended its latest fiscal year with a gross margin of 68.8%.

Those plunging margins are worrisome because IronNet is still deeply unprofitable. Its operating loss widened to $55.3 million in fiscal 2021 then more than quadrupled to $228.8 million in fiscal 2022 (compared to its investor presentation forecast for an operating loss of $47.9 million). Its net loss also widened year over year in the first half of fiscal 2023 -- from $32.3 million to $60.6 million.

IronNet plans to lay off 110 people or 35% of its entire workforce to rein in that spending. However downsizing the company right now could make it even less competitive against larger rivals.

4. Running out of cash

IronNet ended the second quarter with a mere $9.7 million in cash and equivalents. It borrowed another $10 million after the quarter ended but those new notes mature in just 18 months with a high interest rate of 5%. That's a dire situation for a company that will likely lose tens of millions of dollars throughout the second half of the year.

5. Its co-CEO and CFO just quit

As IronNet faces this existential crisis two of its top executives -- co-CEO William Welch and CFO James Gerber -- abruptly resigned. Alexander will become sole CEO while Fidelis Cybersecurity's president Cameron Pforr will replace Gerber. These jarring executive changes could make it even harder for IronNet to implement a coherent turnaround strategy while staying solvent.

The company said Gerber is leaving IronNet to join a private cybersecurity company while Welch is resigning ""in light of the restructuring of the business.""

Avoid this company

IronNet's stock doesn't look cheap even at four times this year's sales especially since that price-to-sales ratio is still tethered to analysts' outdated expectations for 21% sales growth this year. Its growth rates also look abysmal compared to other better-run cybersecurity companies. Investors should avoid this broken SPAC-backed company like the plague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RlY2h3aXJlYXNpYS5jb20vMDkvMjAyMi93aHktc3RyZW5ndGhlbmluZy1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXBvc3R1cmUtaW4tYXVzdHJhbGlhLWlzLWtleS10by1zZWN1cmUtaXRzLWNyaXRpY2FsLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why strengthening cybersecurity posture in Australia is key to secure its critical infrastructures,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='techwireasia.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /09/2022/why-strengthening-cybersecurity-posture-in-australia-is-key-to-secure-its-critical-infrastructures/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FB0B910>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RlY2h3aXJlYXNpYS5jb20vMDkvMjAyMi93aHktc3RyZW5ndGhlbmluZy1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXBvc3R1cmUtaW4tYXVzdHJhbGlhLWlzLWtleS10by1zZWN1cmUtaXRzLWNyaXRpY2FsLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Discovery or Paramount to Compete,"Comcast is looking forward to 2024 a year in which it will gain: A) Hulu or B) a boatload of money based on Hulu’s huge valuation. There’s also C): It could buy another significant media company a purchase possibly financed in part by B. And let’s face it: NBCU needs one of those outcomes to compete in the streaming wars. With or without next-day NBC episodes Peacock is no contender for the crown.

In January 2024 Comcast will likely sell its 33 percent ownership interest in Hulu to Disney. According to a deal the companies made in 2019 Hulu is valued at a guaranteed minimum of $27.5 billion. Disney’s two-thirds ownership share has a baseline value of $18 billion with NBCU’s third at $9 billion but only Disney contractually has to buy its partner out.

At last week’s Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia event Comcast CEO Brian L. Roberts pushed an alternate alternative: What if the seller becomes the buyer?

“If [Hulu] was for sale put up for sale Comcast would be interested and so would a lot of other tech and media companies” Roberts said. “And you would have robust auction. There’s never been a pure-play fabulous scaled streaming service put on the market.”

Fabulous! And also? Unlikely. At $18 billion that would be a very pricey buy for Comcast. Any non-Disney buyers would almost certainly no longer have access to ABC or the FX on Hulu content and given the overall Hulu valuation of $27.5 billion (set by the owners not necessarily the market) it’s a bid that only a trillion-dollar company would — or at least should — really consider. Amazon which just ingested MGM has Prime Video; Apple seems to prefer a small-scale approach; Microsoft and YouTube owner Alphabet seem unlikely to move into a very crowded streaming space that’s already ripe for consolidation. That places Roberts’ claim of Comcast interest somewhere between a threat and a shrewd negotiating tactic.

Other options? Comcast could beef up its streaming presence with key NBCUniversal competitor Paramount Global. If Comcast bought Paramount it could integrate Paramount+ (which now includes Showtime OTT) and FAST leader Pluto TV into its streaming portfolio. At this writing the Paramount Global market cap is $15 billion. Its enterprise value or the amount it would actually cost to purchase the company (value + cash + debt) is about $31 billion. Comcast shares are currently worth a combined $152 billion or about 10 Paramounts. So it’s affordable.

The fly in that particular ointment is CBS since FCC rules don’t allow one company to operate two broadcast networks — and NBCUniversal isn’t about to give up the “NBC.”

Paramount Global chief Bob Bakish believes his company will make for an attractive acquisition target at a time when subscribers and content are king.

“When I look at a company to buy — we’ve done a bunch of smaller deals particularly in Latin America and you can rest assured we look at all the deals — the single most important thing is ‘If you buy the company can you use the content?’ The answer typically is no not for a while” Bakish said a few months back during a Morgan Stanley conference keynote. “Our investment strategy is increasing optionality because we’re gaining more and more control over high-quality content.”

Peacock had 13 million paid subscribers at the end of Q2; Paramount+ had 43 million. Tempting but Comcast executive VP and Deputy CFO Jason Armstrong said it’s less likely. “The focus probably isn’t on acquiring large subscriber bases” he said at a Bank of America investor conference earlier this month. “Instead it’s specific technologies that are either we don’t have or that are better than the current evolution of what we have in the system.”

A bigger play would be one for Warner Bros. Discovery; a few years back Comcast considered disrupting the Discovery takeover with a bid of its own. THR’s Kim Masters wrote that it is “accepted wisdom at the highest levels of the industry” that another deal is coming for WBD. IndieWire confirmed that a meeting between Roberts and WBD boss David Zaslav took place at the Allen & Co. media conference in Sun Valley which presents optical (if circumstantial) evidence of camaraderie. However since discussing M&A options at this point would break a host of laws sometimes it’s just lunch.

WBD’s market cap is slightly more than double Paramount’s at this point and its massive debt ($50 billion) plus considerable cash on hand (about $2 billion) makes this option a considerably larger undertaking if a more-appealing one; you’d want HBO/Max/Discovery+ and their combined 90 million streaming subscribers over Paramount+ and the Warner Bros. studio over Paramount Pictures. Although WBD does not operate a broadcast network like Paramount Global the sheer scale of the buy would create regulatory hurdles. Anyway due to the terms of its April 2022 merger WBD is in an SEC timeout until April 2024.

Comcast declined comment for this story. One Warner Bros. Discovery insider told IndieWire the idea of a Comcast takeover is “ridiculous” — but that doesn’t mean it isn’t crazy enough to work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcGFyYW1vdW50LWdsb2JhbC1vd25lZC1jaGFubmVsLTUtMTExNjM3MDQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK's Channel 5 Shows 'The Emoji Movie' Instead of Queen Elizabeth II's Funeral Gets Mocked on Twitter,"Paramount Global-owned network Channel 5 was the only U.K. public service broadcaster not to show any royal-related coverage on Monday (Sept. 19) while Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral was taking place in London.

While BBC One BBC Two and ITV broadcast the funeral live and Channel 4 showed a documentary on the Queen Channel 5 instead broadcast “The Emoji Movie” inspiring much mirth on social media.

“The Emoji Movie” which was released in 2017 is part of a block of children’s programming from Channel 5 taking place on Monday morning. Earlier the network broadcast “Thomas and Friends: Race for the Sodor Cup” followed by “The Adventures of Paddington.”

With the day of the Queen’s funeral declared a public holiday schools were closed on Monday and Channel 5’s decision was likely made to offer them an alternative. As one viewer wrote on Twitter: “Really don’t understand the criticism of Channel 5 for showing ‘The Emoji Movie’ ‘Stuart Little’ etc during the Queen’s funeral. What are kids of families who don’t have paid TV/streaming supposed to do otherwise sit and watch white people in suits look overly sad for 6 hours?”

There has been mild criticism of the amount of coverage dedicated to the Queen and the royals since the monarch’s death on Sept. 8. Broadcasting schedules across the world were thrown into disarray eleven days ago after doctors announced they were “concerned” about her health followed by the confirmation of her death some hours later.

BBC One has yet to return to any normal scheduling and along with other networks has dedicated hours of coverage to the procession of the Queen’s coffin from Scotland where she died to London followed by her lying-in-state as well as coverage of other members of the royal family including King Charles III his siblings and his children.

Despite the weeks of coverage the BBC said last week it had only received a small number of complaints especially in comparison to the number of complaints the corporation received following its coverage of the death of the Queen’s husband Prince Philip in 2021.

Variety has contacted Channel 5 for comment.

Robert Sarver the team's owner since 2004 has been accused of using racist slurs on multiple occasions and fostering a culture of bullying and discrimination against female employees.

The NBA suspended Sarver for a year and issued a fine of $10 million which basketball player LeBron James and other team and sports executives considered too lenient.

""We have reviewed the report of the NBA league's independent investigation into Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver and have found his conduct unacceptable and in conflict with our values"" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman stated.

PayPal sought disciplinary action beyond the one-year suspension CNBC reports.

The league is under pressure to defend its penalty for Sarver which is less severe than its decision in 2014 to force Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers for making racist comments.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver described his ""disbelief"" over Sarver's conduct documented in the Wachtell report but said the league had dealt with it somewhat.

Price Action: PYPL shares traded lower by 1.52% at $92.57 in the premarket on the last check Monday.

The most common mobile payment app scams

Many mobile peer-to-peer payment apps make it easy for users to send money fast. That speed can give scammers the chance to take advantage of people who aren’t paying attention according to Capital One.

The American Bankers Association and Capital One share some of the most common mobile payment app scams on their websites including the following scenarios:

“Suspicious activity” scam: Scammers impersonating your bank may call or send a text to alert you about “suspicious activity” on your account and direct you to send money to yourself or to “the bank’s address” in order to reverse a transaction or to verify the account is not frozen — but you’re actually sending money to the impostor and not your bank.

Fraud alert scam: A scammer may reach out claiming to represent your bank’s fraud department and ask you to confirm personal information such as your username and password credit card or debit card information or your Social Security number in an effort to create a new account using your information steal your identity and gain access to your other personal accounts.

But once they receive your money you never receive what you paid for and they disappear.

But once they receive your money you never receive what you paid for and they disappear. “Accidental” payment scam: A scammer “accidentally” sends you money through a mobile payment app using a stolen credit card and asks you to send the money back. But that payment is typically reversed when the credit card is reported as stolen. If you send funds ""back"" to the scammer you end up losing money.

Work-from-home scam: You accept a work-from-home position and the company sends you a check to deposit then asks you to send all or part of the funds to someone else using a mobile payment app. Do not deposit the check — the company is a scam and the check will bounce leaving you on the hook for the amount of the fake deposit the American Bankers Association says.

The association and ‘support’ have to be with in the intention of furthering the activities of a terrorist organisation.”

On Abbasi’s iPhone the police claim to have found bookmarked web pages and search history showing that he had visited articles on ISIS Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind  the M4 carbine and anti-tank missiles. The chargesheet also mentions articles influenced by “radical Islamist ideology” and written mostly by Ahmad Musa Jibril who allegedly “ inspired ” the 2017 London Bridge terror attack.

After trawling Abbasi’s social media activity the police claim that they found him to be “a follower of ISIS supporters and sympathisers” such as @shamiwitness meaning the pro-ISIS handle allegedly run by Mehdi Masroor Biswas  a Bengaluru engineer who was arrested in 2014 under UAPA for “aiding and abetting” a terrorist organisation. Noting Abbasi’s “online association with Biswas” the chargesheet claims that “the accused via tweets and retweets was trying to propogate jihadist ideology as espoused by ISIS”.

Biswas’s Twitter account was shut down soon after his arrest in 2014 so the police have travelled further back to find a 2013 comment posted by Abbasi on a forum called Islam Awakening to establish his alleged terror links. The comment replying to a thread on “Musa Cerontnio: Great Islamic Empire in Politics Jihad and Current Affair” reads: “I thought terrorism (as it’s understood by the West today) is the foreign policy of the Islamic State for the wrongdoers. Goes without saying.” By “wrongdoers” the police claim Abbasi “refers to non-Muslims”.

‘Suspicious transactions’

In addition to the electronic evidence the chargesheet details some of Abbasi’s monetary transactions that the police declare that they found suspicious. It mentions an email sent to Abbasi on July 23 2020 by the online payments platform PayPal informing him that his account has been restricted “for sending payments which were suspicious”. The police claim to have received from PayPal a list of 14 accounts which Abbasi had sent money to. There’s a possibility that these payments were “linked to terrorist financing” but “this is not confirmed it’s only a suspicion”.

Abbasi the chargesheet alleges transferred Rs 669841 to groups affiliated with ISIS in Germany Sweden America Britain Canada Australia between 2018 and 2020.

A person close to Abbasi’s family confirmed he had indeed sent money abroad. “He would ask his father to donate money for the construction of mosques in foreign countries” he said explaining how Abbasi found the money. But this person who spoke on the condition of anonymity declined to elaborate how much money Abbasi transferred out and whether it was actually used for the stated purpose.

On these monetary transactions Supreme Court lawyer Abu Bakr Sabbaq told Newslaundry there was a “possibility” that Abbasi had been sending money abroad to people known to him.

“But in this case the intermediary [PayPal] declined to process the transaction” he said. “So as a matter of investigation it needs to be established whether the accounts that money was being sent to were compromised in any way.”

He added “Mere association cannot be grounds for an offence under UAPA as long as you are not part of a conspiracy.”

Abbasi who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from IIT Bombay worked at the Nayara Energy Refinery in Jamnagar in Gujarat until April 2018 when he had a psychotic episode. He had been suffering from mental illness since he was 12 years old the person close to his family claimed and underwent psychiatrist treatment after the 2018 episode.

At the last hearing in his case on September 9 Abbasi’s lawyers filed a discharge petition under section 84 of the penal code and section 328 of the CrPC that allow for relief on grounds of unsound mind. His lawyers have claimed Abbasi’s attack on the security guards was a consequence of his mental health problems which include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Dr Arun Khatri the psychiatrist who treated Abbasi in Jamnagar declined to comment citing patient confidentiality and the court proceedings.

But Dr Ashoka Jahnavi Prasad a psychiatrist in Gorakhpur who has seen Abbasi’s medical records confirmed that he was afflicted by mental illness. “This person was on heavy tranquillisers for a year” he said “though he was irregular with medication.”

Prasad expressed concern about the police’s handling of the matter. “They have produced a certificate from a local doctor an orthopaedic surgeon” he explained. “They should have gone to a medical board to establish the mens rea.” Mens rea means the intent behind committing a crime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L2xpbmtlZGluLW1hZmlhLWZpZ21h0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's time to talk about the LinkedIn Mafia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE5L2xpbmtlZGluLW1hZmlhLWZpZ21h0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950C63700>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

NEW YORK Sept. 19 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With the United States welcoming tens of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan Ukraine and other crises today dozens of America's largest employers and best-known brands are announcing new commitments to hire 22725 refugees in full time positions in the U.S. helping to advance the economic and social integration of refugees across the country. This is the most significant set of business commitments in support of refugees on record.

The U.S. Business Summit on Refugees organized by the Tent Partnership for Refugees (Tent) — a network of 260 major businesses committed to supporting the economic integration of refugees — brings together leading companies including Amazon Hilton PepsiCo Pfizer and Tyson Foods to announce commitments to hire and train thousands of refugees in the United States over the next three years. The Summit is the first in a series of milestones to continue to mobilize companies in support of refugees.

""The American business community is showing incredible leadership and I am so proud of the companies standing up for refugees today"" said Hamdi Ulukaya CEO of Chobani and founder of Tent. ""These companies will benefit from welcoming these hard-working loyal and resilient individuals – but my hope is that this is only the beginning. As refugee crises start to fade from the headlines companies must recognize that hiring refugees is not only the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do.""

The United States is set to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees in the coming years including almost 100000 Afghans by the end of 2022 100000 Ukrainians who have fled Russia's invasion and up to 125000 refugees per year from other parts of the world who will arrive through the resettlement program. As refugees in the U.S. often face significant challenges finding work – including language barriers difficulty certifying their credentials and lack of a professional network – business leadership is critical to help refugees secure jobs.

Among the commitments companies are announcing today:

Amazon will hire at least 5000 refugees over three years

will hire at least 5000 refugees over three years ManpowerGroup will place 3000 refugees in jobs at its corporate clients over three years

will place 3000 refugees in jobs at its corporate clients over three years Tyson Foods will hire 2500 refugees over three years

will hire 2500 refugees over three years Blackstone portfolio companies and real estate properties will hire 2000 refugees over three years

portfolio companies and real estate properties will hire 2000 refugees over three years Hilton will hire 1500 refugees over three years

will hire 1500 refugees over three years Marriott International will hire 1500 refugees over three years

will hire 1500 refugees over three years Cargill will hire 1000 refugees over three years

will hire 500 refugees over three years PepsiCo will hire 500 refugees over three years

will hire 500 refugees over three years Pfizer will hire 500 refugees over three years

""We believe that Amazon is a stronger company because of the diversity of our workforce and we actively seek to hire people with different backgrounds skill sets and levels of experience. Being displaced from your homeland and having to start again somewhere is never easy which is why we are committed to helping where we can by providing refugees and other displaced people with access to meaningful employment as well as immigration support through our Welcome Door program. It's our privilege to help people make a new start."" said Janet Saura VP Employee Relations WW Amazon Stores and Corporate.

""Our experience connecting refugees with meaningful work across Europe tells us that finding a job is a critical first step for people to get settled build relationships and integrate themselves and their families into new communities"" said Jonas Prising ManpowerGroup Chairman and CEO. ""We believe collective partnership is critical to achieve impact at scale and we are pleased to partner with Tent in mobilizing the business community to improve the lives and livelihoods of millions of refugees. This is how we will create a path to sustainable employment so refugees can rebuild their lives and improve their prospects for a better future.""

The following companies are making additional hiring commitments: Accenture Aimbridge Hospitality Albea Amcor Atento C&S Wholesale Grocers Carrols Chobani Deloitte Fedex Gap Inc. Genpact Graham Packaging Great Lakes Cheese Henry Schein IHG Hotels & Resorts Kellogg Kimball Midwest La Colombe Mastercorp Oneida Nation Enterprises Panda Express Red Roof Silgan Dispensing Sodexo Spencer's & Spirit Halloween Sumitomo Electric The Body Shop Transdev US Xpress.

These hiring commitments are estimated to generate $913 million in income for refugees in the U.S. each year. They will not only help thousands of refugees start their new lives in the U.S. with security and dignity but also harness the skills and resilience of refugees to strengthen the U.S. workforce fill key labor gaps and boost the economy.

In addition LinkedIn Coursera Ipsos and others are announcing commitments to provide 13850 refugees with training opportunities which will help them gain a better understanding of the U.S. job market develop skills and grow their professional networks.

A complete list of the commitments can be found here .

Tent has been active in the U.S. since its founding in 2016. In September 2021 in the wake of the mass evacuation of Afghans to the United States Tent launched its Coalition for Refugees in the U.S. – which now counts more than 110 U.S. employers – to provide companies with U.S.-specific guidance and resources on how to set up effective refugee hiring and training programs.

On 18 September 400 000 doses of the Comirnaty mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Pfizer/BioNTech were delivered to Ukraine under the framework of the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. The vaccines will be distributed throughout 23 regions in the country by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

“Together with our international partners we continue to deliver vaccines against COVID-19 to Ukraine. With the approach of the autumn/winter period it is especially important to protect yourself from COVID-19 because as the experience of past years shows the incidence increases sharply at this time” said Dr Ihor Kuzin Deputy Minister of Health and Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine.

“Vaccination is an important priority during humanitarian emergencies and one of UNICEF's key areas of work aimed at the protection and well-being of children and their parents. UNICEF will continue to help Ukraine provide access to immunization and adhere to a cold chain for vaccines” emphasized Mr Murat Sahin United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Representative in Ukraine.

Dr Jarno Habicht WHO Representative in Ukraine explained “WHO continues to support Ukraine’s health system through the delivery of vaccines via the COVAX Facility and has trained over 30 000 health workers on the safe and effective use of COVID-19 vaccines including on the use of the Comirnaty Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.”

Dr Habicht added “WHO urges everybody especially the elderly people with chronic diseases and those belonging to at-risk groups to get their primary vaccine series and boosters against COVID-19 and to protect themselves and others as we enter the autumn/winter period.”

The Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech contains messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecules that encode the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. After the vaccine is administered this mRNA enters the cells of the body and provides them with a kind of instruction on how to create this protein. The immune system recognizes that the protein does not belong to the person and produces antibodies against it. This is how the body learns to protect itself in the case of an encounter with a real SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The vaccine is approved for emergency use by WHO. In Ukraine the Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was registered for use on 22 February 2021.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation Ukraine has received COVID-19 vaccines for free through COVAX. COVAX is an international initiative that promotes access to effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19 for all countries. Deliveries on behalf of the initiative will continue to protect as many people as possible in Ukraine from the coronavirus disease.

All adults and children over the age of 12 can be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Ukraine. A booster dose can be taken by all people over the age of 18. The second booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine is available for all people over 60 years old in Ukraine as well as to those aged 18–59 with underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of a severe course of COVID-19.

The European Union the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi) UNICEF the United Kingdom the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and WHO all continue to support Ukraine on COVID-19 vaccination. Future deliveries will ensure that as many people as possible receive protection.

The Comirnaty vaccine delivery was made possible thanks to financial support from USAID.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhYmxldG1hZy5jb20vc2VjdGlvbnMvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9wZml6ZXItbW9kZXJuYS10ZXN0LWNvdmlkLWJvb3N0ZXItZWlnaHQtbWljZS16ZXJvLWh1bWFucy1mZGEtYXBwcm92ZXMtYW55d2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5th Covid Booster Lacks Efficacy Data,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhYmxldG1hZy5jb20vc2VjdGlvbnMvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9wZml6ZXItbW9kZXJuYS10ZXN0LWNvdmlkLWJvb3N0ZXItZWlnaHQtbWljZS16ZXJvLWh1bWFucy1mZGEtYXBwcm92ZXMtYW55d2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952D0C2B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Now the slump threatens to cut into BioNTech's revenue hauls in 2022 and beyond according to one group of analysts.

Since much of the world has “decided to live with the virus"" ODDO BHF analysts slashed their forecasts for BioNTech’s 2022 and 2023 COVID vaccine sales by 28% and 33% respectively. This year the team expects BioNTech to record Comirnaty sales of 14.1 billion euros which is ""at the low end"" of the company's guidance of 13 billion euros to 17 billion euros the team noted.

For all of 2021 BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine helped the company generate total revenues of 19 billion euros.

When it comes to delivery volumes for 2022 ODDO now thinks BioNTech will be able to deliver 2.64 billion doses under its arrangement with Pfizer down significantly from a previous estimate of 3.64 billion doses. Beyond 2022 BioNTech is expected to deliver 1.14 billion doses of a booster vaccine each year down from a previous annual forecast of 1.74 billion doses the analysts wrote.

The team originally thought “bottom demand” from China of 100 million doses a year could pad out Comirnaty’s sales haul but “we now reduce this to zero” the ODDO team said.

“We assumed that Comirnaty could be approved during the summer but it looks as if China will follow its lockdown strategy rather than using an efficacious vaccine (in preventing severe disease)” they explained.

Elsewhere industry watchers and pharma execs have repeatedly suggested that the eventual commercial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines could resemble the flu shot market—and that’s not necessarily a good thing for BioNTech the ODDO analysts pointed out.

Citing studies that have shown between 95% and 99% of populations in the developed world are immunized against COVID-19—either through vaccination infection or both—the ODDO team points out that “large parts of the world have decided to live with the virus like with the flu virus.” They also flagged the fact that COVID-19 mortality rates in the developed world have dropped to “the influenza level or even below.”

In light of the evolving prophylactic landscape ODDO foresees yearly vaccination campaigns targeting “mostly vulnerable people largely above 60 years of age.” That’s a more limited group than was included in the ODDO team’s previous forecast of annual campaigns for the broader population over 40 years of age.

Still it’s not all bad news for BioNTech which has been on an expansion spree over the past two years. The ODDO team expects BioNTech’s cash position to skyrocket from 1.7 billion euros at the end of 2021 to 19 billion euros by the end of 2022. Come 2024 BioNTech could pocket revenues of 26.9 billion euros the analysts added noting they expect Comirnaty “should remain a cash cow.” COVID aside the ODDO team notes BioNTech’s pipeline in oncology is “building up.”

“Beyond our forecast period until 2024 the pipeline beyond Comirnaty should become more important” the ODDO team said.

BioNTech has already had to grapple with decreased vaccine demand this year. Over the second quarter the Pfizer partner logged revenues of 3.2 billion euros ($3.3 billion) a whopping 40% decline from the amount it made during the same period in 2021. The sales plunge was nearly 50% down from the company’s first-quarter revenue figure of 6.4 billion euros too.

“The development of the pandemic has been and remains dynamic causing a rephasing of orders with this leading to fluctuations in quarterly revenue” BioNTech’s chief financial officer Jens Holstein said on a conference call last month. The company attributed much of the shortfall to delays in vaccine deliveries to the European Union.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyMDkxOC9wZml6ZXItZGlyZWN0b3ItcGxheWVkLXJvbGUtaW4tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtcGF4bG92aWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer director played role in development of Paxlovid,"Barbara Rodríguez director of Drug Product Manufacturing Wednesday Aug. 31 2022 in her office at Pfizer in Groton.

Groton ― Barbara Rodríguez a director of Drug Product Manufacturing at Pfizer was interested in pharmacy from a young age and her high school teachers nurtured that passion for science by mentoring her and providing opportunities to apply for internships.

Rodríguez a first-generation Cuban American born in Union City N.J. said her parents who came to the United States in the 1970s from Cuba with a third-grade education and demonstrated a strong work ethic and the value of an education inspired her to obtain her doctorate degree in pharmaceutical sciences.

After working in factories her father gained the skills to have a small grocery store where he and her mother worked together. Rodríguez helped out in the store in high school and later worked in a retail pharmacy. She completed seven internships in high school and college.

Rodríguez 47 who joined Pfizer about 18 years ago is part of a team of 40 people that manufactures potential medicines that are entering clinical trials. Recently she and her team played a role to help make Paxlovid which is an antiviral to help treat high risk cases of COVID-19 to emergency use authorization.

“We were all very proud of that development” she said.

Growing up Rodríguez said her family did not have health care and the importance of healthcare helps drive her.

“I saw the challenges that we went through that others in the community went through in health care and I know the importance of being able to bring new medicines new treatments that aren’t available to help maintain better lifestyle and give people hope as well” she said.

Rodríguez is working to inspire the next generation of scientists. When her children were younger she did science experiments using kits provided by Pfizer in the classroom.

She said a diverse workforce brings in new perspectives and different experiences and ways of thinking that drive innovation.

“Bringing your best self to work means being who you are authentically” Rodríguez said.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWF0dG9ybmV5LXByaXNvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWFwcGVhbC5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2NpbmNpbm5hdGkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtYXR0b3JuZXktcHJpc29uLXJlbGVhc2UtYXBwZWFsLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

The global E-cigarettes market is expected to grow from $18.15 billion in 2021 to $21.63 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.2%. The market is expected to reach $38.53 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 15.5%.

Major players in the e-cigarettes market are Philip Morris International MCIG Inc Altria Group Inc British American Tobacco plc Japan Tobacco Inc Imperial Tobacco Group Njoy Inc International Vapor Group Reynolds American Inc and VMR Product.

Growth is mainly due to the companies resuming their operations and adapting to the new normal while recovering from the COVID-19 impact which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing remote working and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges.



The e-cigarettes market consists of sales of e-cigarettes. An E-cigarette is a handheld battery-operated electronic device that contains a solution of nicotine glycerine and flavorings which turns into a mist that can be inhaled by the user. These are available in various flavors such as mint menthol and chocolate.



The main product types of e-cigarettes are Disposable Rechargeable Modular. A disposable product is intended to be thrown away after use. The composition used is tobacco flavors nicotine-free. The distribution channels include specialist e-cig shops online supermarkets tobacconists others.



Rising awareness of health issues caused by smoking conventional tobacco cigarettes among the smoking population is driving the growth of the e-cigarettes market. Conventional tobacco cigarettes release toxic compounds that adversely affect the health of the individual. The e-cigarettes are less toxic and safer compared to conventional tobacco cigarettes.

For instance the British American Tobacco company released the Vype iSwitch and Vype iSwitch Maxx based on Puretech blade technology which involves using an ultra-slim stainless-steel blade to heat e-liquid and create vapor. The vapor products do not burn tobacco the vapor contains significantly lower levels of toxicants in the smoke created when burning tobacco. Therefore e-cigarettes have reduced risk properties compared to traditional cigarettes.



Increased government regulations on the ban on e-cigarettes are restraining the growth of the e-cigarettes market. Many countries have banned the sale and manufacture of e-cigarettes to protect young people and children from the harmful effects and addiction of e-cigarettes.

For instance in December 2019 the Indian government has passed the prohibition of electronic cigarettes (production manufacture sale distribution import export transport storage and advertisement) bill 2019 that imposed the ban on e-cigarettes. The government banned the e-cigarettes as the manufacturing companies were promoting them as a way to get people out of smoking habits but research studies have shown that most people are addicted to them.



An increasing number of mergers and acquisitions between traditional cigarette and e-cigarette manufacturers is trending in the e-cigarettes market. Traditional cigarette manufacturing companies and e-cigarette manufacturers are collaborating for product development or to improve their presence in the global market.

For instance British American Tobacco plc (BAT) an American British multinational cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company acquired Reynolds American Inc. for $49 billion. The acquisition favored BAT to have a stable presence in high-growth emerging markets and high profitability developed markets. Reynolds American Inc is an American tobacco company that manufactures tobacco products and e-cigarettes.



In August 2019 Philip Morris Swiss-American multinational cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company merged with Altria's for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition is aimed at dominating the fast-growing electronic-cigarette market. Altria Group Inc is a US-based company and one of the world's largest producers and marketers of tobacco and cigarettes.



The countries covered in the e-cigarettes market are Australia Brazil China France Germany India Indonesia Japan Russia South Korea UK and USA.

The DOJ filed a lawsuit in February aimed at stopping the $8 billion acquisition. The Agency argued the deal would give the largest US health insurer access to its competitors’ data and ultimately push up healthcare costs.

UnitedHealth announced the all-cash deal in January 2021 saying it would help streamline administrative and payment processes.

Judge Carl Nichols said in a brief order on Monday that he would deny the government’s request to stop the deal and ordered the companies to go forward with an asset sale that they had proposed.

The order follows a trial in the case in August in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.

UnitedHealth said it was “pleased with the decision” and looked forward to combining with Change as quickly as possible.

U.S. Bancorp PNC and Truist – along with Bank of America Citi JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo – play an outsized role in our financial system and economy. They serve hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses and have assets of $13 trillion that represent over 50 percent of the nation’s GDP.

While the nation’s largest banks rake in huge profits they have continued to fail their customers and workers. Banks bring in billions of overdraft fees from customers put their wealthy Wall Street clients over Main Street small businesses and consumers for PPP loans during the pandemic and fail to help customers whose money is stolen on Zelle – a payments network owned by seven banks including Bank of America JP Morgan Chase PNC Truist U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

The snapshots follow dozens of reports of consumer abuse from large financial institutions nationwide. On Thursday the banks’ CEOs will testify at the Committee’s annual bank oversight hearing.

The snapshot on PNC can be found here.

The snapshot on U.S. Bancorp can be found here.

The snapshot on Truist can be found here.

The Committee will release snapshots for the other testifying banks later this week in the leadup to the hearing.

For years Senate Democrats have pressed the biggest banks to do right by their customers and they will continue to fight for the working Americans and small businesses that make our economy work. More information about their work can be found here.

It also plans to get involved in local trade programs.

North Texas has landed another headquarters relocation from the West Coast.

After first approaching the Rockwall Economic Development Corporation to discuss the move last October California-based Integrated Defense Products (IDP) a family-owned specialty manufacturer of parts for the defense firearm aerospace and medical industries announced plans to relocate its headquarters to the city’s Rockwall Technology Park.

“I’m confident that not only will the company benefit our local economy by expanding the tax base and creating jobs the leadership at IDP will become familiar faces in the community” Rockwall EDC president Phil Wagner said in a statement.

IDP to bring $7M in taxable value to Rockwall

In addition to offices the 21000 square-foot facility will include “considerable space” for IDP’s CNC milling and turning machines along with areas for operations like shipping and receiving assembly and quality control.

IDP says it has committed to adding at least $7 million in new taxable value to Rockwall largely through the new facility and taxable equipment within it.

To staff the new facility which is expected to be complete by next spring IDP aims to employ 40 workers—with 25 to 30 coming from the local talent pool. The company has 12 employees relocating to the region including President Brandon Buschold The Dallas Morning New reports. IDP said by getting involved in local trade programs it hopes to train the next generation of workers in the manufacturing engineering and production fields.

“It’s imperative that we always keep an eye on the future. Without any real focus on our youth there will be a lack of innovation—and ultimately no torch to pass on” Buschold said.

Talent taxes and trade programs a draw for IDP

Buschold citied the local workforce as one of the draws for IDP’s relocation to the region in addition to things like ongoing trade programs he cited a “reasonable” cost of living lower taxes and a “business-friendly” environment.”

IDP joins Canadian chocolate maker Chewters Chocolates in recently announcing plans to place a footprint in Rockwall. In late July the maker of organic low-sugar treats announced plans to invest $40 million to develop a 189000-square-foot manufacturing facility in the Rockwall Technology Park—a move that’s expected to create 120 jobs.

“Exceptional companies are flocking to the Lone Star State because of our world-class business climate and unmatched highly skilled diverse workforce” Governor Greg Abbott said when Chewters made its announcement.

It’s become the US Department of Action as it turns out the grand ol’ USDA.

Big wins for industrials include:

$5M for Scaling Up the Industrial Hemp Supply Chain as Carbon Negative Feedstock for Fuel and Fiber $6M for Reducing GHG Emissions and Improving Soil Carbon Sequestration Potential through High- Carbon Soil Amendment $15M for Industrial Hemp for Fiber and Grain $25M for An Integrated Approach to Scaling-Up Climate-Smart Practices for Crop Livestock and Agroforestry Production $30M for the The GEVO Climate-Smart Farm-to-Flight Program $30M for Climate-Smart Camelina $35M for Climate-Smart Specialty Grains and Oilseeds: Covering America from Coast to Coast and $70M for The Climate-Smart Agriculture Innovative Finance Initiative.

Ultimately USDA’s anticipated investment will triple to more than $3 billion in pilots that will create market opportunities for American commodities produced using climate-smart production practices. These initial projects will expand markets for climate-smart commodities leverage the greenhouse gas benefits of climate-smart commodity production and provide direct benefits to production agriculture including for small and underserved producers.

USDA is currently evaluating project proposals from the second funding pool which includes funding requests from $250000 to $4.9 million. These projects will emphasize the enrollment of small and/or underserved producers and/or monitoring reporting and verification activities developed at minority-serving institutions. USDA said it expects to announce these selections later this fall.

The Background and funding mechanism

Applicants submitted more than 450 project proposals in the first funding pool and the strength of the projects identified led USDA to increase its investment from the initial $1 billion Vilsack announced earlier this year he said.

Funding for Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities will be delivered through USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation in two pools. The first funding pool included proposals seeking funds ranging from $5 million to $100 million. USDA received over 450 proposals from more than 350 entities including nonprofit organizations; for-profits and government entities; farmer cooperatives; conservation energy and environmental groups; state tribal and local governments; universities (including minority serving institutions); small businesses; and large corporations.

Sectoral Trends

Phase 1: During this five-year period corporate profit grew at a slower pace due to multiple macroeconomic headwinds and high interest rates said to MOSL adding that the MOFSL universe profit registered a 6 percent CAGR during Phase 1 primarily led by Technology and O&G sectors.

""Financials’ profit recorded a 2 percent CAGR only due to significant decline in PSBs’ share in MOFSL Profit pool to 1.5 percent in FY17 from 11 percent in FY12. Further Metals saw significant weakness due to supply-side issues weak underlying commodity prices and mining bans during the period. Its contribution in MOFSL profit pool dipped to 8 percent in FY17 from 18 percent in FY12"" stated the brokerage

Phase 2: During this period corporate profit growth recovered smartly fueled by tax rate cuts reduction in the banking sector NPAs and post-pandemic tailwinds that drove profitability of sectors after a weak two-year base noted the brokerage.

MOFSL universe profit reported a faster CAGR of 14 percent during Phase 2 to Rs 7.7 lakh crore. Financials continued to drive profit growth followed by O&G Metals Technology and Consumers it added.

""Private Banks continued to see strong profit growth contributing 12 percent to the overall coverage universe profit in FY22. Metals clocked a strong recovery in profit share after a weak period (FY12-17) and expanded its contribution in the profit pool to 20 percent in FY22 from a mere 8 percent in FY17. However Automobiles recorded a very challenging period with its earnings declining at a CAGR of 6.7 percent over FY17-22 and its share in profit pool shrinking to 2.5 percent in FY22 from 9.2 percent in FY17"" the data showed.

Cella the principal overseeing branch development at financial services firm Edward Jones still takes tremendous pride in having graduated from the university with his bachelor’s degree in marketing in 1993.

“Attending the university really gave me such a solid foundation in business and in life that it put me on a path to create success beyond what I could have imagined” said Cella who began working for Edward Jones as an intern while still a student at UMSL in 1990 and has spent his entire career with the Fortune 500 company.

But it was more than loyalty to his alma mater that convinced him to take on the extra leadership responsibility.

“The reason I said yes quite frankly is because of Chancellor Sobolik’s leadership and the amazingly transformative time for the university” said Cella who replaced retired Express Scripts Chairman and CEO George Paz as president of the council and led the first meeting of his three-year term on Friday.

UMSL’s campus is beginning a physical transformation bolstered by a $40 million appropriation by the Missouri Legislature of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. As UMSL moves into its 60th year the university is also aiming to take a more prominent role championing economic growth and equity in the St. Louis region.

In addition to his leadership role with UMSL Cella supports the region’s primary civic and business leadership council Greater St. Louis Inc. He is currently a member of the board of directors as well as chair of GSL’s ChamberSTL public policy initiative. Cella believes that the alignment of the business community institutions and organizations both large and small – reflecting the diversity that exists across the region’s 15 counties in Missouri and Illinois – can help drive strategic investment and create a forward-looking economic vision for St. Louis. He also believes his alma mater has an important role to play in bringing that vision of inclusive economic growth to reality.

“What I hope the Chancellor’s Council can do is really lead change for the university and for the region bringing together interventions and solutions that help people access higher education which will expand their capabilities while making an impact on St. Louis” Cella said. “Such a large percentage of UMSL alumni live and work in St. Louis. They choose to make it their home and the university has a difference-making opportunity like none other because of that.”

UMSL which counts more than 80000 graduates in the St. Louis area has been lauded by U.S. News & World Report and others for promoting social mobility and equity. It has excelled at supporting a diverse group of students many with high economic need as they pursue their degrees and enhance their economic futures after graduation.

“We welcome Ken as the chair of the Chancellor’s Council given his leadership and engagement in the St. Louis region and we collectively work to rise St. Louis as a resurgent city” Sobolik said. “Ken is a proud UMSL alum and knows first-hand the transformative value of an UMSL education. He also has a key leadership role for one of the largest corporations in the nation one that collaborates with UMSL in a number of programs that support our students educational relevancy and inclusive prosperity.”

Cella also supports UMSL’s work with Edward Jones to promote inclusive economic growth and opportunity throughout St. Louis. The firm has been a major supporter of UMSL Accelerate’s DEI Accelerator program which provides underrepresented entrepreneurs and startups capital investment and training paving the way for future success and innovation.

Additionally UMSL and Edward Jones co-lead the St. Louis Anchor Action Network an alliance of higher education institutions hospital systems corporations and nonprofits with a shared commitment to advancing racial equity and removing barriers to economic opportunity. The network is focusing its efforts on increasing hiring purchasing and investing in Black and Brown communities in north St. Louis city and north St. Louis County following decades of disinvestment.

“There’s a connection point as I think about moving into the role of president of the Council” Cella said. “What moves me about that is helping to drive sustained investment in people and places guided by a shared commitment to racial equity removing barriers to economic opportunity for people and creating a more inclusive region. UMSL can be such a huge part of that so I’m thrilled to be able to try to advance all of that in this role.”

Cella who also serves as the vice chair of the Securities Industry and Financial Management Association the nation’s leading trade association for broker-dealers investment banks and asset managers operating in the U.S. and global capital markets hopes to expand the Chancellor’s Council during his term as president. He’d like to bring more community and business leaders on board to support the mission of the university whether they have a past affiliation with UMSL or simply want to connect with its future.

“We have an opportunity to get better at telling our story and promoting what we offer that no other university in St. Louis or for that matter even in the state of Missouri can do” Cella said. “It’s really about challenging current perceptions. We have an opportunity to share a narrative and to help people have experiences like I had when they come on campus to see what’s changing and how engaging it really is. We want to encourage more alumni and students to share their stories because they’ve had that experience to get involved and contribute to UMSL’s success.”

Cella is a past president of the UMSL Alumni Association and has been a member of the Chancellor’s Council’s executive committee since 2015.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

CEO robbed at gunpoint says crime is driving businesses away from San Francisco

SAN FRANCISCO (KPIX) -- Hamid Moghadam knows about the city's crime problem all too well. The CEO of San Francisco-based Prologis was robbed at gunpoint outside of his home in broad daylight.

""This is a gang that does this all the time and they had targeted me from the parking lot"" said Moghadam.

The suspects followed Moghadam to his home in broad daylight.

""A car rushed by stopped right next to me and two guys jumped out with guns pointed at my face"" he said. ""It just happened so quickly honestly I didn't have time to get scared.""

The thieves wanted his watch and they got it and then got away.

Moghadam wasn't harmed but he was left broken-hearted.

""This city has a special place for us because we started our business here.""

He started Prologis four decades ago turning it into a multi-billion dollar real estate empire with offices around the world.

Moghadam wanted to tell his story to KPIX 5 because on top of this serious rise in crime he has another concern -- his employees' safety and the concern other companies may decide to leave or not set up shop here in San Francisco.

""When this happened I said 'somebody has to get up and actually say enough is enough' and I decided to do that.""

So he decided to write local and state lawmakers.

""I heard back from the governor right away within a couple of hours and the mayor called"" said Moghadam.

But he said everybody is concerned but stuck on how to solve this problem.

""I get all kinds of San Francisco jokes when I travel the world. It's almost embarrassing and that's the perception and that affects tourism and convention business"" said Moghadam. ""A lot of jobs are involved. Once you go over the tipping point it becomes very very difficult to getting it back.""

How close are we to 'not getting it back?'

""Pretty close"" said Moghadam. ""I don' like saying that but it's the honest to goodness truth.""

Moghadam says safety should be the top priority. He is part of the executive committee of the Bay Area Council an economic development association.

""The public is aware changes need to occur and we need to think differently"" said president Jim Wunderman. ""Our policies need to be different our actions need to be different.""

The Bay Area Council found that more than half of respondents felt San Francisco wasn't safe with nearly two thirds saying they avoided downtown because of crime.

""We have to solve these things. We are developing a reputational issue as a place not to go to"" said Wunderman. ""That's not good for the Bay Area so we have to be hard-nosed for action and success.

So how does the city address the crime?

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said it's all about focusing on repeat offenders and getting the message out that San Francisco is getting tough on crime.

""You can't leave Oakland or Santa Clara or San Mateo and come to San Francisco and get away with crime"" said DA Jenkins. ""The other thing is really partnering with the San Francisco Police Department jointly working very hard to address the more problematic areas of the city. We cannot have our downtown be flooded with crime that's where most of our engagement is where our conventions are so we need to be making sure that we are making strategic decision to address certain bad pocket areas very publicly.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvZHVrZS1yZWFsdHktbWVyZ2VyLWNhdXNpbmctMTIwLWxheW9mZnMtaW4taW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvZHVrZS1yZWFsdHktbWVyZ2VyLWNhdXNpbmctMTIwLWxheW9mZnMtaW4taW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Realty merger causing 120 layoffs in Indianapolis,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox59.com/news/duke-realty-merger-causing-120-layoffs-in-indianapolis/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvZHVrZS1yZWFsdHktbWVyZ2VyLWNhdXNpbmctMTIwLWxheW9mZnMtaW4taW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvZHVrZS1yZWFsdHktbWVyZ2VyLWNhdXNpbmctMTIwLWxheW9mZnMtaW4taW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9leHRyYS1zcGFjZS1zdG9yYWdlLWV4ci1ib29zdHMtMTMwNTAxMjE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Extra Space Storage (EXR) Boosts Portfolio With Storage Express,"As part of its efforts to boost the national portfolio and the operating platform Extra Space Storage Inc. EXR has completed the acquisition of Storage Express for roughly $590 million. The move resulted in the addition of 107 remotely operated stores across Indiana Ohio Illinois and Kentucky to EXR’s portfolio.



Specifically the acquisition involved all Storage Express assets including trademarks contracts licenses intellectual property and 14 future development sites.



Furthermore Extra Space Storage acquired a storage software operating platform named E-Tracker. This software operating platform supports Storage Express locations along with Bargold Storage Systems LLC which was acquired by EXR in June 2022.



EXR also announced the appointment of Jefferson Shreve the founder and owner of Storage Express to the board effective immediately.



This transaction which was funded partly by the issuance of $125 million in operating partnership units with the balance in cash drawn from its credit facilities offers scope to Extra Space Storage to add smaller remotely managed stores to both its new and existing markets through acquisitions and third-party management.



Extra Space Storage significantly expanded its business in recent years growing its branded-store count from 910 in 2012 to 2177 as of Jun 30 2022 in 41 states and Washington D.C. Also the total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 181 to 864 during the same period.



Along with acquisitions the company is making strategic investments through other channels in the storage sector including preferred equity investments and bridge loan programs.



These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City UT-based self-storage REIT emerge as the second-largest self-storage owner and/or operator and largest self-storage management company in the United States. Extra Space Storage gained an increased scale in several core markets through these acquisitions and fortified its presence in several new markets.



With a focus on primary and secondary markets the company remains well-poised to capitalize on favorable trends.

This capital influx has contributed to the sector delivering world-changing breakthroughs—gene therapies precision oncology therapeutics and effective treatments for hepatitis C for example.

1

The 2021–22 biotech public-market downturn was dramatic and sobering. As with prior public-market cycles in biotech and other sectors the downturn offers a chance to reflect on what has changed and what the sector can do differently in the future. In the context of an incredibly robust innovation landscape and strength in biotech private markets this article focuses on new approaches to operations financing and partnerships that together represent a survival kit for biotechs to emerge stronger from the downturn.

2

We looked at the cash situations of the cohort of biotechs that went public in the 2010s and the 2020–21 IPO boom (Exhibit 3). Half of the story is positive with many biotechs buoyed by some of the largest-ever IPOs and follow-on public offerings; in this cohort the median cash on hand is greater than $200 million. The other half of the story is challenging with hundreds of biotechs having less than two years of cash on hand and looking for financing in a down market.

3

One of the first questions industry players ask is “What will large biopharma do?” To date the answer has been the disciplined execution of long-term strategies. The 20 largest biopharma companies made 11 acquisitions in the first half of 2022—exactly on trend with an average of 22 acquisitions a year over the past five years (Exhibit 4). These acquisitions featured assets that were derisked clinically or commercially and terms that were derisked where uncertainty remained. Licensing deals for preclinical and early clinical assets have remained high continuing a long-term shift toward earlier-stage deal making. Large biopharma mergers and acquisitions will likely increase as the public-market downturn extends but this will be a solution for only a handful of biotechs rather than hundreds. Companies lacking a clear exit opportunity because for example they’re unable to attract large biopharma interest at more than a 50 percent premium to their current share price must evaluate atypical financing and partnership options.

4

Meeting the challenge

Biotechs always need capital. Today at a moment of sector-wide valuation challenges more biotechs than ever need capital. A new era of streamlined and flexible operations alternative financing solutions and biotech-to-biotech business development and licensing (BD&L) may emerge.

Since the downturn began in 2021 most biotechs have reevaluated their development programs and either decided to stay the course or focus on fewer higher-priority programs. Portfolio optimization is an ongoing activity that has taken on more urgency because of capital constraints and is being approached differently because of pipeline crowding in certain indications and modalities and new analytics applications. Management teams and boards can also consider broader shifts in the biotech ecosystem and the “beyond the pipeline” strategic options they present.

Streamlined operations with a sharper focus on value creation. One major shift over the past decade has been rising expense levels for a typical biotech company. General and administrative (G&A) expenses in a biotech’s first full year as a public company have grown steadily rising from a median of $11 million for 2012 IPOs to $25 million for 2020 IPOs. The most notable feature of G&A expenses today is how much they vary even after adjusting for a company’s stage (preclinical or clinical) of development. Preclinical biotech G&A expenses can range from $19 million to $30 million per annum and clinical expenses from $15 million to $43 million (Exhibit 5).

5

The second shift in operations has come from hybrid work spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has caused less disruption in biotech than in other sectors since the lab work that constitutes the bulk of R&D is mostly done in person but some management teams have adopted remote-working practices leaving office spaces underused and raising questions about how biotechs should operate as they scale. We expect a third shift in how biotechs operate to come from the evolving role of outsourcing.

Like all companies biotechs are only as good as their people and we often hear from CEOs that their biggest challenge is attracting top talent given competition and the cost of living in major biotech clusters. These expenses and some others such as public-company reporting costs are unavoidable for a stand-alone biotech. Still many operational costs are optional and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis:

real estate including whether flexible office space or more sharing of office and lab space with other biotechs might be feasible

travel and expenses including the possibility of fully remote collaboration models for management and hybrid conference attendance

resourcing including the possibility of an optimized functional headcount to reduce near-term burn rate; building out management teams more slowly by for example partnering more closely with venture capitalists (VCs) to compensate; outsourcing resource-heavy R&D roles including clinical operations; and leveraging partners and contractors for precommercial work and stand-up teams faster prior to launch

salaries including whether nonstandard compensation packages could reduce fixed costs

supply including for example switching contract manufacturing companies and contract development and manufacturing companies if new partners can lower costs (or increase the probability of success)

commercialization including the possibility of US launches being accomplished with leaner and more flexible resourcing models and earlier consideration of ex-US licensing deals (also a potential source of near-term capital)

Going forward we expect greater scrutiny from investors on how capital is deployed beyond the pipeline. Successful biotechs will ensure a clear connection between capital allocation and value creation especially in R&D but also in broader company operations. For example precommercial companies with G&A expenses greater than 25 percent of total expenses (a benchmark for more efficient biotechs) may need to justify their choices.

Going forward we expect greater scrutiny from investors on how capital is deployed beyond the pipeline. Successful biotechs will ensure a clear connection between capital allocation and value creation in R&D and in broader company operations.

Alternative financing solutions. A complex and dynamic financing landscape has emerged as public markets have soured over the past 12 months. Some commercial-stage biotechs with favorable valuations have achieved successful follow-ons and many biotechs across stages have secured funding from existing investors often through private investments in public equity but these options are unattractive or unobtainable for many companies given current valuations. How can hundreds of public biotechs gain financing through the downturn?

We see a patchwork of alternative options linked to recent shifts in biotech financing including the growth of royalty deals the emergence of structured financing for clinical trials an expanded role for private equity and debt financing.

Royalty deals used to be reserved for marketed assets but they have now become an option for late-stage development and have spiked in number and value. Royalty monetization was more than $10 billion over the past five years (Exhibit 6). It could grow further if it extends to midstage pipeline assets and helps to boost companies that cannot be financed in public markets. Royalty financing carries low risk and a moderate cost of capital. It may be a good fit for multi-asset biotechs because the royalties would apply to the entire future business.

Another nontraditional form of financing could come from private equity. In recent years many private-equity investors based in Europe and the United States have added capabilities to enable clinical-trial financing; they have acquired or made investments in venture capital blurring the lines between private equity and VC. There has also been an uptick in healthcare private-equity fundraising in the first half of this year matching VC raises (Exhibit 6). We anticipate that a broader group of biotechs will partner with well-capitalized private-equity investors while on the journey toward an improved public market or toward proof points that derisk investment for large biopharmas. More private-equity-led buyouts are also a possibility.

6

Debt financing has seldom been used but market challenges have led to an uptick among clinical- and commercial-stage companies. Multiple biotechs have recently taken on debt in isolation or as part of broader financing packages. Debt-financing vehicles are best explored by extensive analysis of the long-term implications such as the ability to service convertible notes in the context of all plausible future scenarios for the company considering trial outcomes commercial performance stock price operating expenses and other potential investment needs.

Biotechs should consider the characteristics and long-term implications of debt and other financing options (Exhibit 7). Finally we note that the core objective of the biotech ecosystem is to deliver on the promise of innovative biotechnologies and the highest-potential assets in the pipeline. Undifferentiated assets and platforms will struggle to find capital that may be better deployed elsewhere.

7

Biotech-to-biotech BD&L to realize benefits of scale. Large biopharma companies have long been the default partner for early-stage licensing and acquisitions once clinical or commercial proof points have been demonstrated. They will probably remain so but biotechs in search of partners or acquirers now have additional options in the form of commercial-stage biotechs and biotech asset aggregators.

Biotechs are independent for good reasons; it allows the formation of a team of scientists and executives with bespoke capabilities a laser focus on developing and maximizing a core platform and incentives to reach transformative long-term impact. These benefits may continue as an asset portfolio or platform matures but they often become less compelling. The biotech downturn has shone a harsh light on the inefficiencies of single-asset companies. Capital-constrained companies—as well as some with plentiful capital—could create value by merging with or acquiring other biotechs and realizing the benefits of greater scale.

Eighty biotechs launched new products between 2017 and 2021 and transitioned from R&D-only to fully integrated biotech companies. Forty-one percent of the 273 new molecular entities launched in this period came from companies launching their first product or following up on a first-time launch in the prior five years (Exhibit 8) up from 19 percent in prior years. This rise was driven by readily available capital limited acquisition interest from large biopharma companies and potential for value creation in independent companies developing specialty medicines. Prior analysis has shown that valuations for biotechs with marketed assets have been less damaged during the downturn. In a down market biotechs that have recently launched their first product could be natural licensees or acquirers if they have a strong cash position and a desire to grow their portfolios.

8

In recent years we’ve also seen the maturing of new approaches to building portfolios with several asset aggregators showing that you don’t need to be a large biopharma to finance and manage multiple assets. These companies have their own valuations challenges but they represent another newer category of acquirers or licensees of clinical-stage assets that other biotechs could engage.

Clinical and preclinical biotechs have not typically partnered or merged but the dual threat of cash constraints and valuation challenges could lead to creative deal making. Such combination therapy for biotechs could take multiple forms:

Immediate capital synergy: a capitalized biotech with a relatively weak pipeline could combine with a cash-constrained biotech with a stronger pipeline.

Efficient value creation: complementary platforms and portfolios can be more valuable when combined. For example data technology or intellectual property (IP) assets could enhance differentiation and the probability of success. Also certain assets and programs could be managed more effectively together than alone if companies had complementary technical and management expertise.

Near-term capital synergy: certain combinations could reduce or eliminate near-term capital needs for instance for building out a cell-therapy biotech’s manufacturing or a late-stage asset developer’s commercial infrastructure.

Delivering on the promise of the biotech pipeline

The strategies selected will depend on company context the willingness of management teams and boards to pursue more unusual strategy options and companies’ ability to execute. The successful implementation of new strategies may require detailed road maps and efficient management of processes such as postmerger integration; proactive syndication with investors explaining how practical and bold actions today could bridge to the next inflection point and future aspirations; and robust change and talent management.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5hZ2VkLXNlcnZpY2VzL2luZ3JhbS1taWNyby1wbGFucy10by1nby1wdWJsaWMtYWdhaW4td2l0aC1jb25maWRlbnRpYWwtZmlsaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ingram Micro Plans To Go Public Again With Confidential Filing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5hZ2VkLXNlcnZpY2VzL2luZ3JhbS1taWNyby1wbGFucy10by1nby1wdWJsaWMtYWdhaW4td2l0aC1jb25maWRlbnRpYWwtZmlsaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950F9D990>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A version of this article appeared on Fortune.com.

In the last decade technology companies like Airbnb Snowflake Stripe and Crowdstrike led a wave of disruption that reordered established industries and invented whole new ones. Along the way they created astonishing value. In June the number of private billion-dollar start-ups exceeded 1100 according to data from CB Insights a more than tripling in five years of these once-rare unicorns. As a group they reached a value of roughly $4 trillion to $5 trillion before the recent market correction according to CB Insights and Crunchbase.

This explosion has been backed by a new wave of growth equity investors. While many traditional venture capitalists narrowed their focus to early-stage companies that have not yet achieved product market fit the funding of a new class of investors pioneering a different model of investment grew significantly (see Figure 1). These growth equity investors deploy large amounts of capital—often exceeding $100 million in a single funding round—to help relatively mature companies pursue breakthrough innovation and scale at an unprecedented pace. They often double down in later fund-raising rounds positioning themselves as long-term investors by holding their stakes through the initial public offering (IPO) and beyond. As a result newly minted growth specialist funds hedge funds refocused VC firms and other growth equity investors have become the financial partner of choice for many fast-growth companies.

Figure 1 In technology growth equity has increased faster than all other investment segments

Thanks to this new model in recent years capital ceased to be a limiting factor for a private company’s quick scaling. Some 30% of companies that went public in 2020 had raised more than $100 million before their IPO compared with 7% in 2015. This made it possible for Space X (valued at approximately $125 billion) and Shein (at approximately $100 billion) to grow to huge valuations while still private and helped Uber’s IPO reach $70 billion-plus and Kuaishou Technology’s debut in the range of $150 billion to $160 billion. Once public growth-backed software companies continued to perform. Among software companies growth equity-backed tech companies account for only 8% of revenue but 19% of growth 14% of sales and marketing spending and 13% of research and development spending.

Growth equity’s first big test came in 2022. By May as interest rates hit high-growth stocks and the IPO markets the cumulative market capitalization of the fastest-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks had fallen almost 70% according to Meritech. Tech IPO volume in the first half of 2022 fell 80% from the same period a year earlier. The number of late-stage financing rounds collapsed. High-profile investors began to speak of black swans and tough times ahead. Companies that once couldn’t hire fast enough started letting people go. Today both Kuaishou and Uber trade well below their offering price.

Was this the growth equity bubble bursting?

That’s an understandable question given the 2022 crash in valuations for high-growth assets but growth equity has fundamentally altered tech investing over the last decade and there is a strong argument that the underlying changes that led to the creation of the asset class remain sound—as technical innovation will continue to create opportunities for fast-scaling companies.

Technological innovation

Innovative technology will continue to help build and scale disruptive businesses. Cloud computing puts highly scalable data centers and advanced capabilities at the fingertips of fledgling companies. Cloud-native companies like Snowflake Databricks and GitLab catapulted to success with tools for cloud data analytics artificial intelligence and DevOps. Their technology’s modularity the way applications communicate via API-based architectures has built an ecosystem of complementary solutions that collectively compete against the monoliths. And the next generation is waiting in the wings—nascent technologies like the Internet of Things quantum computing artificial intelligence virtual reality autonomy new space and web3. Not all will succeed but the ones that do will become the next generation of growth equity-backed leaders.

Business model innovation

Business model innovation has changed how technology is bought and sold. SaaS customers no longer have to install and operate technology purchases themselves. Thanks to open-source freemium and product-led growth models today’s frontline users can both try and buy technology. Other business model innovations have lowered the barriers to entry in industries previously considered immune to tech disruption including financial services healthcare and even space in the process creating a well-understood playbook and an ecosystem of executives and investors experienced in running and investing based on it.

This flywheel of disruption is accelerating as innovations combine to create more innovation a concept called recombinatory innovation. Think of how GPS cell phones and digital maps together created real-time navigation. Even in a world where geopolitical tensions increasingly affect the technology industry innovation today remains a global market nurturing a rich worldwide competition of ideas.

Steps to take now

While the new model of innovation has already spread strong roots the market shock of 2022 will have ramifications. Once-rising stars will have to focus sooner on unit economics and a path to profitability. Fallen angels that haven’t lived up to expectations would benefit from thinking like a private equity investor: What costs products or customer segments would they cut? What assets would they sell in order to concentrate on the core?

Incumbent tech leaders have a unique opportunity to fundamentally rethink corporate innovation patterns and after doing their homework aggressively pursue mergers and acquisitions (M&A) partnerships with innovators and talent acquisition. Three steps are paramount.

Develop the skills to sense disruption. No industry or company is safe from disruption. Invest in customer relationships and deeply understand their needs. Ensure your customer and competitive intelligence is up to the task of monitoring the landscape and informing your strategy. Assess where you can partner and integrate with the next generation of companies including the use of corporate venture capital as a means to better understand partner with and cultivate the ecosystem. Commit to major investments. Most companies will need to become tech-native. That may require new organizational structures talent culture and budgeting. Rationalize your innovation bets by focusing resources where you can win and cutting subscale half-hearted efforts. Reevaluate your M&A strategy for an environment in which buying the winners will remain difficult due to growth equity-backed valuations and founders who see selling to a big corporation as less attractive. Get good at scaling. An incumbent may never be as innovative as a founder able to raise $100 million but it does have valuable assets a disrupter may lack: business ecosystems customers and often a strong core business. Established companies that figure out how to unlock untapped potential in those assets and scale them can borrow a page from the unicorns and set themselves on a whole new growth trajectory.

Savvy incumbents can compete with growth equity-backed success stories. Google Cloud’s sustained investment and innovation in analytics has enabled BigQuery to go toe-to-toe with Snowflake for example. And Dynatrace incubated Ruxit a cloud-native observability tool under the Compuware banner that is now its core product helping it compete with growth equity-backed Datadog.

Whether as direct competitors complementary partners or acquirers companies are smart to operate on the principle that growth equity-backed business innovation is here to stay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGJheWJ1c2luZXNzam91cm5hbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9ldmVudHMvZGlzY292ZXItd2h5LXRoZXNlLTEwMC1ub3J0aC1iYXktY29tcGFuaWVzLWFyZS1iZXN0LXBsYWNlcy10by13b3JrLWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover why these 100 North Bay companies are Best Places to Work in 2022,"Discover why these 100 North Bay companies are Best Places to Work in 2022

Welcome to our special section honoring this year’s winners of the North Bay Business Journal’s Best Places to Work awards. It’s always a wonderful honor for me to call attention to the 100 employers receiving this award because it’s a recognition which is largely the result of how their employees view them.

But as an additional point of pride this year we at the Journal are celebrating for another reason. This is the 35th year that the North Bay Business Journal has had the privilege of serving the region’s business community. Yes first with our weekly publication and then later by offering a vital informative website we’ve been committed to serving businesses in the primary counties we report on: Marin Napa Solano and Sonoma.

As we do that each day underlying the effort is our mission to provide relevant business

news on the trends events and people in the area. We work so you can: stay informed get connected and celebrate success.

That “celebrate success” idea is exactly what we do with this issue of the North Bay Business Journal.

To determine our company winners this year we were pleased that more than 4700 employee surveys were completed for the nominated companies. Our business world continues to be a changing one for sure – working remote working back in the office or hybrid – so it’s heartening that so many employees took the time to complete the survey and provide their views of their workplace.

And out of a possible five the average score on the survey of workers was 4.8. Several of the companies had 100% employee-survey participation and others were very close to that figure.

Preparation for the 17th annual Best Places to Work awards began in early summer followed by a mandatory anonymous survey period.. The final selections were made in August.

Those selections by the editorial staff of the Journal were based on the employee survey results and participation comments and employer application.

And a point of history in this the 17th annual Best Places to Work awards. In our first year we chose 24 winners. And while the numbers have gone up our vision remains about what’s at the core of this program. It’s the need to recognize exceptional employees and highlight exceptional workplace practices.

While it has been great to get the responses we have gotten for the Best Places to Work awards we’ve always felt the award is only part of the impact of the effort.

The larger longer-term value is the anonymous feedback of employees. Used expertly

this feedback can tell an organization where it is doing well and where it might improve. And the designation continues to be an invaluable tool for employee attraction and retention.

I have been honored in the year since becoming Journal publisher to meet many of you in the business community individually or at our events. The Best Places to Work celebration was held on Sept. 14 sponsored by Exchange Bank and Trope Group. It was a great way to congratulate this year’s winners.

Punjabi singer-actor Ammy Virk who recently said garnering as much audience as Diljit Dosanjh was not possible has proved himself wrong. Ammy Virk is currently awaiting his release 'Chhalle Mundiyan' and also he recently concluded his Dubai music tour.

Ammy Virk who knows how to delight his fans was overwhelmed with the kind of response that he received during his Dubai tour. But how did Ammy Virk prove himself wrong?

Recently Ammy Virk during an exclusive interview with PTC Punjabi said that he knew his potential and that he could not garner as much audience as Diljit Dosanjh. He had also ascertained that he will work hard to reach the kind of fame Diljit Dosanjh holds.

However Ammy Virk seemed to be wrong here as his recently concluded Dubai tour was sold out and the fans were amazed to see their favourite star performing live in front of their eyes.

Yes Ammy Virk is not Diljit Dosanjh indeed but he is Ammy and he holds his own separate fanbase. Overwhelmed with the response of his fans Ammy took to his Instagram and expressed gratitude to his fans.

EXR has completed the acquisition of Storage Express for roughly $590 million. The move resulted in the addition of 107 remotely operated stores across Indiana Ohio Illinois and Kentucky to EXR’s portfolio.



Specifically the acquisition involved all Storage Express assets including trademarks contracts licenses intellectual property and 14 future development sites.



Furthermore Extra Space Storage acquired a storage software operating platform named E-Tracker. This software operating platform supports Storage Express locations along with Bargold Storage Systems LLC which was acquired by EXR in June 2022.



EXR also announced the appointment of Jefferson Shreve the founder and owner of Storage Express to the board effective immediately.



This transaction which was funded partly by the issuance of $125 million in operating partnership units with the balance in cash drawn from its credit facilities offers scope to Extra Space Storage to add smaller remotely managed stores to both its new and existing markets through acquisitions and third-party management.



Extra Space Storage significantly expanded its business in recent years growing its branded-store count from 910 in 2012 to 2177 as of Jun 30 2022 in 41 states and Washington D.C. Also the total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 181 to 864 during the same period.



Along with acquisitions the company is making strategic investments through other channels in the storage sector including preferred equity investments and bridge loan programs.



These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City UT-based self-storage REIT emerge as the second-largest self-storage owner and/or operator and largest self-storage management company in the United States. Extra Space Storage gained an increased scale in several core markets through these acquisitions and fortified its presence in several new markets.



With a focus on primary and secondary markets the company remains well-poised to capitalize on favorable trends.

Climeworks Carbfix and DNV have partnered to develop the world’s first full-chain methodology dedicated to CDR via direct air capture (DAC) and underground mineralization storage. The methodology has been validated in line with ISO 14064-2 and verifies the integrity of Climeworks’ CDR thus enabling the delivery of third-party verified CDR and leading industry action with high environmental integrity.

The two modular methodologies focusing on 1) DAC and 2) storage through permanent underground mineralization provide the requirements for stringent standards by which measurement and reporting of Climeworks’ CDR and Carbfix's permanent mineralization can be third-party verified and communicated to customers. With these much-needed methodologies Climeworks and Carbfix aim to contribute to the standardization and scale-up of high-quality permanent removals.

The methodologies set criteria for high environmental integrity CDR and take a rigorous stance on safeguarding quality. They were validated by DNV a global leader in quality assurance by advising on the principles of methodology development and ensuring robustness and accuracy of the approach.

DNV then conducted an onsite audit where a review of documentation interviews with staff and site inspection verified that Climeworks is producing CDR and Carbfix is mineralizing CO₂ underground in accordance with those methodologies.

DNV concluded the audit by verifying Climeworks’ CDR via Climeworks’ DAC and Carbfix’s mineral storage technologies to be:

Reported accurately avoiding any chance of double counting or inclusion of removals that cannot be supported by measured data

Measured accurately and reflecting the net emissions removed after adjusting for emissions resulting from plant construction operation and disposal in compliance with ISO 14064-2 Standards

Strict transparent and accountable to the monitoring procedure in place to detect any involuntary release of CO₂ and changes within the storage reservoir that may risk the permanence of CO₂ storage.

Climeworks and Carbfix are proud to have developed and implemented the first full-chain methodology for CDR via DAC+S in close consultation with and validated by DNV.

Climeworks welcomes public and industry experts to contribute to the conversation about high-quality standards by reviewing and commenting on the validated methodologies at [email protected]

Even as the Category 1 hurricane moved onto the impoverished Dominican Republic destroying roads and power lines as much as 30 inches of rain continued to pour down on parts of Puerto Rico yesterday.

The US territory is still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico exactly five years ago today. The island’s largely working class population has been rendered more vulnerable to such disasters by the looting of its state-owned utilities and other public assets under the terms of the financial restructuring imposed on the debt-ridden island by the US government.

Climate scientists have explained that Hurricane Fiona’s heavy rainfall is an example of how global warming is influencing the intensity of storms. “If you have warmer water you’ll have more evaporation which means you have more moisture in the atmosphere which means you can get more precipitation” Kevin Reed an associate professor of atmospheric science at Stony Brook University in New York told NBC News. A study co-authored by Reed published in April found that the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was 10 percent wetter due to the impact of climate change.

Although weaker than Maria a Category 4-5 hurricane Fiona’s slow-moving storm system and torrential rainfalls have produced even greater flooding than in 2017 according to authorities. The National Weather Service in San Juan on Monday urged residents to move to higher ground “immediately” with Richard Pasch a specialist with the National Hurricane Center adding “Heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding continues across much of Puerto Rico.”

Authorities have reported at least three deaths including a 58-year-old man swept away by a flooded river in the inland town of Comerio but more fatalities are expected as rescuers reach remote areas cut off by mudslides and raging floodwaters.

An island-wide blackout by the newly privatized electric company LUMA Energy which occurred Sunday morning before the hurricane made landfall has left the island’s 3.2 million residents without electricity. Officials admit it could take days if not weeks to restore power to many residents. An estimated two-thirds of the island’s residents also lack clean water.

Many residents only saved themselves from rising flood waters by climbing onto the roofs of their homes. There have been at least 1000 water rescues according to a press update Monday by the island’s Governor Pedro Pierluisi. Evacuations of the towns of Caguas and Toa Baja were also taking place the governor said. Pierluisi was elected governor as the candidate of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party (PNP) but joined the Democratic caucus in the US House of Representatives when he was the island’s non-voting representative.

Residents posted pleas for help on social media. A woman identified as Génesis Lían posted an appeal on Facebook according to a report in the Miami Herald begging for help for a group gathered with her that included a minor a disabled person and an elderly person with diabetes. “We need help we need to get out of our houses in Playa de Salinas urgently. I already called emergency management and nothing I swear I’m swimming and I’m very very cold. I need to get us out of here literally the beach is in the house” she wrote.

In a cruel irony a temporary bridge built by the National Guard after the previous one was destroyed by Hurricane Maria was washed away in the northeastern pueblo of Utuado on Sunday. Videos went viral in 2017 when residents of the town built a makeshift zipline to ferry supplies across the raging river in a shopping cart because of the lack of official support.

Carmen a retired New York City sanitation worker who lives in the southeastern city of Arroyo described the devastating conditions in an interview with the WSWS Monday. “We lost power at 10 a.m. Sunday and there has been no electricity in all of Puerto Rico since yesterday. The entire island has been affected due to so much rain and flooding especially in the more mountainous parts. Trees and electrical posts have been knocked out and the floodwaters were so strong they’ve washed away a bridge. Many people are stuck in their homes until emergency crews can clear the roads and rescue them. There are some shelters to go to but so many have lost their homes.”

“This kind of flooding is worse than what happened during Hurricane Maria” Carmen said. “The southeast is where the most devastating accumulating rain is occurring. In Guayama Maunabo Patilla near the beach areas there has been intense rain and flooding that has destroyed homes and businesses.

“Only 30 percent of the island has potable water. We have 78 pueblos in Puerto Rico but only around 14 trucks of National Guard are helping the governor said. FEMA and more first responders are supposed to be coming from the US mainland.”

Carmen also talked about LUMA Energy the joint venture between Houston-based Quanta Services and Alberta Canada-based ATCO which took over the island’s electrical transmission and distribution system from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) on June 1 2021. Since then residents have continued to be plagued by decaying infrastructure and frequent blackouts.

“The private utility company LUMA has been here more than a year” she said. “They have not done enough for all the money they’re receiving. In the last months there have been many demonstrations protesting the 15-year contract the government negotiated with LUMA.”

“I saw the devastation of Maria” Carmen concluded. “There is little or not enough effort to help the countryside in construction and rebuilding. The money has not been used to repair the damage like for the schools. Instead it has gone into some politicians’ pockets and not sent to where it is needed.”

According to a report in the Associated Press the government has completed only 21 percent of more than 5500 official post-hurricane projects in five years and seven of the island’s 78 municipalities report that not a single project has begun. Only five municipalities report that half of the projects slated for their region have been completed according to an Associated Press review of government data.

As Hurricane Fiona bore down on Puerto Rico more than 3600 homes still have tattered blue tarps serving as a makeshift roof the AP reported.

President Joe Biden signed an emergency declaration for the island on Sunday and claimed that the federal government has “hundreds of personnel on the ground” to assist residents. “Jill and I are keeping the people of Puerto Rico in our prayers as Hurricane Fiona passes over your beautiful island” Biden tweeted Monday morning. “We are here for you and we will get through this together.”

But residents can expect no more from the Democratic president than they did from Republican former President Donald Trump who contemptuously tossed paper towels to desperate islanders after Hurricane Maria hit.

Biden was vice president when President Barack Obama signed into law the bipartisan Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016. The act imposed a virtual financial dictatorship over the island modeled on the robbing of public employee pensions and other city-owned assets in Detroit in 2013-14 and overseen by some of the very same federal judges.

The action was aimed at making the island’s residents—nearly half of whom live below the poverty line—pay for the nearly $70 billion in debt controlled by Wall Street hedge funds like Aurelius Capital and other investors who according to the New York Times had bought up “the island’s bonds at a discount pocket[ed] the high interest and persuade[d] politicians to make decisions that would raise the value of their investments.”

The unelected oversight board imposed draconian measures including the privatization the public schools and electrical services the slashing of public employees’ jobs wages and pensions and increased unemployment. In 2019 the austerity measures combined with the disastrous response to Hurricane Maria triggered mass protests that led to the collapse of the corrupt administration of then-Governor Ricardo Roselló alarming the US and Puerto Rican ruling classes.

According to a report in the San Juan Star US District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain who is presiding over Puerto Rico’s Title III bankruptcy cases including that of PREPA suspended a planned hearing on Monday because lawyers for the retirement systems were “unable to consult their clients because they lack power service.”"

SAN DIEGO – The connected vehicle technology known as cellular-vehicle-to-everything technology (C-V2X) holds the potential to deliver transformational benefits in road safety enhance environmental sustainability and create new jobs in the U.S. Qualcomm Incorporated asserted today in a new white paper C-V2X: A New Era of Smart Transportation in the United States. The new report describes the groundbreaking power of C-V2X and raises the issue that regulatory delays have hindered its deployment.

C-V2X is designed to allow vehicles to communicate with other vehicles infrastructure and vulnerable road users—such as pedestrians and cyclists—without the involvement of a cellular network.

Implementing C-V2X and wireless technologies in transportation will bring about enormous benefits to the public interest such as reducing roadway incidents and improving trip planning transportation mode choice and traffic efficiency – all of which will inevitably lead to lower fuel consumption. Examples of these benefits include real-time route guidance to bypass congestion adjusting vehicle dynamics for optimal speed with less braking and idling for better fuel use and personal mobility services for additional travel options.

The expected benefits from C-V2X also include:

– Up to 10000 fatalities avoided per year

– Up to 800000 injuries avoided per year

– Up to 2800000 fewer damaged vehicles per year and

– Up to $12.6 billion saved per year due to fewer damaged vehicles.

“When vehicles are connected to everything around them drivers and infrastructure can communicate to make travel safer — reducing crashes cutting congestion and lowering emissions” said Jim Misener Senior Director of Product Management Qualcomm Technologies Inc. “Due to its many societal benefits automakers and the public sector are showing strong interest in deploying C-V2X.”

“The economic benefits will be substantial” said Kirti Gupta Vice President for Technology & Economic Strategy Qualcomm Incorporated. “C-V2X will create an estimated 120000 U.S. jobs in developing new products applications services and smart infrastructure. These benefits will flow to people across all economic sectors geographies and skill levels but can only begin to be realized once FCC grants the pending waivers which the automotive industry overwhelmingly supports.”

The white paper calls on the federal government to draw up a national C-V2X deployment plan and urges the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve waiver requests for the implementation of C-V2X in the 5.9 GHz band. The report notes that automakers state departments of transportation metropolitan planning organizations and local agencies are eager to deploy connected vehicle technology. But progress towards C-V2X in the U.S. has been stalled by regulatory impediments. Meanwhile other countries are increasing investment in this critical technology.

“The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to modernize our nation’s infrastructure with more than $1 trillion in federal funding for projects that incorporate new and innovative technologies” Gupta said. “State regional and local governments must think creatively about how to use this funding to implement C-V2X.”

This feature launches in the United States and Canada first starting in November.

A Reuters report this weekend indicated that the satellite features are enabled by a Qualcomm X65 modem inside the phones. An Apple statement to Reuters also said that custom Apple-designed radio frequency components and software also make the satellite feature possible.

The Qualcomm X65 modem enables 5G cellular connectivity for phone calls and data but also and ‘band n53’ which enables the iPhone to communicate with satellites in the sky. Specifically Apple has partnered with satellite infrastructure managed by Globalstar.

Emergency SOS via Satellite will be available when the user initiates an Emergency SOS call but fails to connect to a cell tower. In that case the phone will present the option to connect to satellite and send a short text message instead. Users will need a clear view of the sky for the feature to work; iOS will direct the user to point their device to line up with satellites overhead.

If local emergency services can use text-based channels the iPhone will transmit these messages directly via the satellite link. If not Apple relay centers will receive the SOS message and call the emergency services on your behalf.

This service will be free for two years starting in November. Apple has not disclosed pricing plans for the satellite service after that free period is up. Country availability is limited to United States and Canada initially.

It is an open secret that Apple’s chip teams are currently working on an in-house 5G modem with the aim to expunge Qualcomm parts from the iPhone entirely with primary goals of power efficiency (longer battery life) and reducing royalty payments to improve unit cost margins of every iPhone sold.

However making a modem is incredibly complicated and many analysts remain skeptical if Apple will succeed. Apple hopes to replicate the success of its custom silicon investments for the A-series and M-series SoCs. The consensus of the rumor mill currently expects the first Apple modem to be ready for primetime in 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTRzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1zb3MtMTE1MjE4MDA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple iPhone 14's Emergency SOS Satellite Connectivity Feature Runs On Qualcomm Chips And More,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='finance.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/apple-iphone-14s-emergency-sos-115218009.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239529DC3D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTRzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1zb3MtMTE1MjE4MDA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2lwaG9uZS0xNC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmVhdHVyZXMtcG9zc2libGUtdGhhbmtzLXRvLXF1YWxjb21tLXNuYXBkcmFnb24teDY1LW1vZGVtL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2lwaG9uZS0xNC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmVhdHVyZXMtcG9zc2libGUtdGhhbmtzLXRvLXF1YWxjb21tLXNuYXBkcmFnb24teDY1LW1vZGVtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 14’s Satellite Features Are Made Possible Thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 5G Modem,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='wccftech.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /iphone-14-satellite-features-possible-thanks-to-qualcomm-snapdragon-x65-modem/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239529DC9A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2lwaG9uZS0xNC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmVhdHVyZXMtcG9zc2libGUtdGhhbmtzLXRvLXF1YWxjb21tLXNuYXBkcmFnb24teDY1LW1vZGVtL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2lwaG9uZS0xNC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmVhdHVyZXMtcG9zc2libGUtdGhhbmtzLXRvLXF1YWxjb21tLXNuYXBkcmFnb24teDY1LW1vZGVtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

9Health Fair is now 365 Health and as it has done for over 40 years the nonprofit will host its annual fall health fairs beginning on Saturday September 24 and running through Saturday November 19 at 28 locations across Colorado.

“The legacy and deep connection to the community first established by 9Health Fair more than 40 years ago has today grown to include services tools and resources that help Coloradans stay healthy 365 days a year and the name 365 Health better represents our organization and its expanded slate of offerings” said Gary Drews CEO of 365 Health. “Nonetheless community health fairs remain an instrumental part of our mission to positively impact the health of Coloradans and we’re pleased to once again host fairs across Colorado this fall.”

Health Fairs by 365 Health provide access to free and affordable preventive health screenings and resources advancing health awareness and empowering participants to assume responsibility for their own health by becoming informed and making smart health-related decisions for the future.

For more information about Health Fairs by 365 Health and a complete list of health fair locations dates times and available screenings at each location visit https://365health.org/healthfair-locations/.

Free adult health screenings offered at Health Fairs by 365 Health vary by location and may include COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccinations blood pressure and height/weight/BMI checks lung function diabetes risk assessment oral health hearing sleep apnea and skin exams among others.

Affordable and convenient screenings offered may also include:

Long-Term Financial Outlook

The Company is reiterating its Fiscal 2023 guidance that was recently provided on its earnings call on August 9th 2022 and introducing its three-year financial outlook.

Over the next three years from a base of Fiscal 2022 through Fiscal 2025 the Company expects an acceleration in revenue growth to a compound annual growth rate of mid- to high-single digits in constant currency. Operating profit growth is expected to exceed the rate of top-line growth as a result of continued operating margin expansion. Operating margin is expected to expand to at least 15% by Fiscal 2025 in constant currency driven by a combination of modest gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage balanced with continued investments in the Company’s long-term strategic priorities.

In addition capital expenditures are expected to represent approximately 4% - 5% of revenue annually through Fiscal 2025.

The Company expects to continue returning excess free cash flow to shareholders over the next three years with plans to return approximately $2 billion on a cumulative basis through Fiscal 2025 through its regular quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases subject to the authorization of its Board of Directors and overall business and market conditions.

The Company’s Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock by 9% to $0.75 per share at the beginning of Fiscal 2023 representing an annual dividend of $3.00 per share.

The Company’s current share repurchase authorization enables it to repurchase up to $1.4 billion in shares of Class A Common Stock subject to overall business and market conditions.

The Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment including ongoing global supply chain and inflationary pressures foreign currency volatility the war in Ukraine COVID-19 variants and other COVID-related disruptions. The full year Fiscal 2023 and long-term outlook excludes certain anticipated restructuring-related and other net charges as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.

NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Because Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global company the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on the Company's reported results. As such in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP"") the Company's discussions often contain references to constant currency measures which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. The Company presents constant currency financial information which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure as a supplement to its reported operating results. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in the Company's businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of or superior to the Company's operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In addition the Company's full year Fiscal 2023 and long-term financial outlook excludes certain anticipated restructuring-related and other one-time charges. The Company uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures among other things to evaluate its operating performance and to better represent the manner in which it conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods. While the Company considers non-U.S. GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results they are not intended to replace nor act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures reported by other companies.

The Company is not able to provide a full reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP because certain material items that impact these measures such as the timing and exact amount of charges related to its restructuring plans have not yet occurred or are out of the Company's control. Accordingly a reconciliation of the Company's non-U.S. GAAP based financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. However the Company has identified the estimated impact of certain items excluded from its financial outlook. Specifically the Company's financial outlook excludes estimated pretax charges of up to approximately $35 million related to its Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan that have not yet been incurred.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9yYWxwaC1sYXVyZW4tcGF0cmljZS1sb3V2ZXQtaW52ZXN0b3ItZGF5LXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1ncm93dGgtMTIzNTMzNTQwNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph Lauren Accelerates Sets Strategic Plan to Build on 'Fortress Foundation',"When Ralph Lauren rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday he was celebrating 25 years as a public company — and also ringing in the firm’s next phase.

Lauren who leads Ralph Lauren Corp. as executive chairman and chief creative officer followed up the stock market milestone with an investor day that highlighted the company’s new strategic plan complete with financial targets for the next three years.

But clearly the founder was also taking stock of the empire he started 55 years ago.

“I am the largest shareholder and I’m very proud of it — and I’m very proud of it because the team here is amazing” Lauren told investors speaking off the cuff. (Lauren owns 100 percent of the company’s Class B shares and about 350000 of its Class A shares giving him control over 84.9 percent of companies’ voting rights).

“Names don’t matter it doesn’t matter who cooked up the stew” said Lauren one of the most famous names in fashion. “If you don’t have a great team you’re never going to have a great company. I’m proud of the team we have here and you all look so cool.”

Lauren said the professionalism of the company’s executive team was “infectious” and specifically thanked chief executive officer Patrice Louvet.

“You’ve done an amazing job and you’ve put this company in the right place” he said.

Lauren also took a dig at his former boss from way back when who didn’t want to get into the tie business with the young designer.

“He said ‘The world is not ready for Ralph Lauren” Lauren recalled. “I feel sorry for the company I left because I turned out to be pretty great.”

Joking aside Lauren said: “I don’t get paid for this but I must say that I hope you understand what it is to feel what I feel. When you get up to go to work in the morning and you’re happy. This company has a heart it has soul it has power. I thank you very much for being here. I love you. I love that you’re here.”

And that is a healthy dose of the Ralph Lauren dream — optimistic and classic with a feeling of family.

Wall Street seemed to buy into the dream to an extent driving up the company’s shares by 3 percent to $96.27 on Monday giving it a market capitalization of $6.5 billion. Still shares of Ralph Lauren — like much of retail and fashion — have fallen sharply this year down 29.2 percent from their 52-week high.

Louvet’s job in the years ahead is to make sure that Ralph’s dream not only reaches more people but that the brand becomes an important part of their lives.

During the investor meeting Louvet laid out the company’s new strategic plan — dubbed “Next Great Chapter: Accelerate” — which builds on and extends on the strategy he laid out in 2018.

The CEO started the meeting with a personal acknowledgement of the founder.

“Ralph you provide us with a clear ambition set of values and purpose that guides everything we do to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style” Louvet said. “That grounds us always has and always must.”

He described Lauren as “so much more than a fashion designer” and “is actually closer to a movie director.”

“Ralph creates worlds and then invites people into these worlds” he said describing it as an approach to luxury that is not about wealth or status but love and family connection.”

And that he said is a powerful business proposition.

In an interview with WWD before the meeting Louvet was also in a mood to both take stock of how the company built what he described as a “fortress foundation” and how it speeds on to its new goal coming on top of $6.2 billion in revenues logged last year.

Over the next three years Ralph Lauren is planning revenue to show a compounded annual growth rate in the mid- to high-single digits with operating profit growth exceeding the top-line expansion in constant currency by 2025. Ralph Lauren also plans to send $2 billion back to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

“Our overall ambition is to be the leading luxury lifestyle company in the world” Louvet said. “When we look at the data it’s very clear that our brand is bigger than our business by far — we have significant runway for our business to catch up with the size of the brand.”

While that message is clear it’s coming to the market at a time of incredible turmoil.

Ultra-high inflation war in Ukraine the threat of a recession general consumer wariness supply chain backups and whatever the next shock to the system might be all have the potential to swamp the message of any company on a given day — as Louvet is very well aware.

But the CEO is laying out a vision for the future of the brand that looks beyond the current turmoil and is based on four years of work to build up the company.

Louvet pointed to progress from the last strategic plan:

A brand that’s been strengthened with more younger consumers buying in and paying more with average unit retail prices up 64 percent over the past four years. The price increases have been driven by more expensive product such as outerwear fewer promotions faster growth in China and higher prices on like-for-like items.

An emphasis on building the core of the brand to 70 percent of the offering highlighting looks like the cable knit sweater the double-breasted blazer and the polo shirt while growing in outerwear wear to work looks and so on.

Transforming the company’s go-to market strategy driving 64 percent of sales from the direct-to-consumer business and growing digital to 26 percent of the overall business.

Louvet sees the last strategic plan as a case of “promises made promises kept” and now he’s playing on that to get investors to follow along with him on this next phase.

The new strategic plan rhymes with the last one coming in three parts and hitting on the same broad areas but with the emphasis placed on the elements now needed to drive the business forward.

The push to elevate the Ralph Lauren brand and bring in fresh faces continues but now the company is zeroing in on retention to boost consumer lifetime value.

So nudging the customer who comes into the Ralph Lauren family by purchasing say a polo to go deeper and buy a sweater a suit or more.

Louvet said the brand’s product depth “uniquely positions us” to keep customers shopping once they connect with the brand.

Ralph Lauren which employs 250 data scientists has also been sharpening its data and analytical skills to help it not just know who bought that polo but what their next step in the brand might be and how to lay that path out with a little marketing.

The company’s effort to build the core has transformed into a plan to drive that business forward and “expand for more.”

That means doubling down on women’s continuing to build outerwear and going big in home.

Louvet said that while 56 percent of the brand’s shoppers are women only 30 percent of the business comes from women’s products.

“They buy for their husbands their boyfriend their children or gifting and not as much for themselves” said the CEO who’s looking to develop women’s to be 50 percent of the business.

Home is also getting a spotlight where Louvet said there is an opportunity to sell more couches and other furnishings.

“Right now the headlines are about people pulling back to some extent in home investment but our lens is absolutely beyond the next few months” he said. “When I think of Ralph Lauren I think of him as so much more than a fashion designer. He creates worlds.”

Louvet described the home category as having “very long-term potential.”

And finally where Ralph Lauren was reworking its go-to market strategy it is now looking to use the breadth of its distribution and touch points — from stores to coffee shops — to win in its 30 top cities around the world 14 of which are in the U.S.

“Our ability to create these ecosystems where we have different Ralph Lauren store formats coupled with quality wholesale combined with surround sound digital is the most effective way to engage with our customers” Louvet said.

The CEO described the overall strategy as “enabled” by five key attributes of Ralph Lauren including its people and culture; its data analytics capabilities; operational savvy; a strong balance sheet and its standing in the area of citizenship and sustainability.

At the meeting Louvet also stressed the importance of having the right people and culture to put the strategy into action.

“Culture eats strategy for breakfast lunch and dinner and our company’s culture is a competitive advantage” he said.

The CEO is looking to press that competitive advantage.

“We’re not just planning for the next three years we’re planning for the next decade and beyond” he said inviting investors to dream a little bit about the future.

“Imagine if every consumer who purchases one of our iconic polo shirts — and we sell over 10 million every year — also bought a pair of our denim a pair of Polo sneakers or one of the new Polo ID bags” he said. “Imagine we were able to replicate our success in men’s in the women’s segment. There’s an amazing runway of possibility for this company. It is the strength of our assets and our fortress foundation that gives us the confidence to continue to dream to imagine.”

The Buccaneers and Saints' Week 2 matchup was a snoozer up until the 4th quarter and all-out brawl on the field between Mike Evans and Marshon Lattimore (the two really hate each other). After both players were ejected from the game it really picked up for the Buccaneers.

Tampa Bay's offense sputtered once again in Week 2 and things will have to improve tremendously on that side of the ball if they hope to contend for another Super Bowl but it was the defense who once again rose to the occasion to secure a win over the New Orleans Saints and give the team a 2-0 record heading back to Raymond James Stadium.

The Buccaneers' defense has been tremendous through its first two games and against the Saints in Week 2 the team forced a total of 5 turnovers (2 fumble recovers and 3 interceptions - one of which Mike Edwards took back for six).

After the game the linebacker gave some choice comments on the Bucs' being able to turn the ball over so much against the Saints.

Devin White is not wrong. The Bucs do have inside knowledge on how to play former teammate Jameis Winston and know that once you get into his head and force him to make plays after initially turning him over it is most likely going to happen again. I don't see White's comments as being over the top or disrespectful in any way but it might have come across that way to another Buccaneer player.

Bucs running back Leonard Fournette went live on his Instagram after the game and could be seen eating Jameis' famous 'W'. The part we are pointing to is when you can see and hear wide receiver Chris Godwin ask Devin White why he said what he said about Jameis - in which he did not seem happy about White's comments on the former Buccaneer QB.

All that aside is that yes the Bucs were able to finally beat the Saints in the regular season and that was mainly due to the outstanding work by the defense to force turnovers.

Through their first two games against the Saints and Cowboys the Bucs' defense has been pretty much unstoppable notching 10 sacks only 13 total points and 552 yards of total offense to their opponents.

Their next challenge will come against Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers when they head to Tampa Bay in Week 3.

The company will continue to sell and support ""existing current generation products"" but won't carry next-gen Nvidia graphics cards.

It follows reports from YouTube channels Gamers Nexus and JayZTwoCents that suggested Nvidia was a poor partner to work with. EVGA CEO Andrew Han apparently said the software maker stopped giving it information about new product announcements and suggested retail pricing and availability before being publicly revealed making planning a challenge. Nvidia also reportedly undercut the prices of partners like EVGA with its own Founders Edition cards which pushed EVGA to sell at a loss to remain competitive.

""We've had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products"" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement emailed to CNET. ""We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.""

Aside from EVGA and Nvidia itself other companies using Nvidia software include Asus Gigabyte MSI Zotac and PNY. EVGA doesn't intend to make AMD or Intel graphics cards either.

When folks think of NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs the first use case that often comes to mind is playing the latest AAA game titles. However the company's powerful graphics processors can also do the heavy lifting in a wide variety of professional workloads as well from 3D modeling to accelerated AI development. We've reviewed mobile workstations like HP's ZBook Firefly 14 and ZBook Fury 15 in the past which target these use cases but the premium prices on those machines are often out many users' reach let alone students on tighter budgets. The high-end NVIDIA Quadro graphics processors in those machines are probably overkill for some engineering students but many of their apps still need some serious graphics oomph. That's why NVIDIA initiated its RTX Laptops for STEM Students program which we're exploring here today.Many high school and college students are digging deep into disciplines that can benefit from GPU hardware acceleration. For example Mechanical and civil engineers need MATLAB to analyze data or SolidWorks to do 3D modeling. Chemical engineering students might rely on physics simulation in Ansys Discovery. Computer science students who are studying machine learning may not need a specialized Jetson AGX Orin developer kit when a GeForce RTX 3050 with its Tensor Cores will do. Even economics majors and statistics-focused business students can benefit from hardware acceleration when programming in R.The benefits according to NVIDIA are twofold: most apps that have GPU acceleration are built with GeForces (and Radeons) in mind as opposed to Intel's integrated graphics processors or Apple's Metal-only GPUs in M1/M2 Macs. That means SolidWorks MATLAB and more can be run directly on the GPU where parallel processing is plentiful and memory bandwidth is abundant in comparison to running them on the CPU. And because of the GPU acceleration in these apps performance is leaps and bounds better than integrated graphics saddled with shared memory bandwidth. Simulations complete faster models animate smoother and statistical models should be computed ahead of platforms without discrete graphics. Let's find out shall we?NVIDIA's RTX Laptops for STEM Students might sound like something that would require specialized laptops with certified drivers but that's generally not the case. For instance the company sent along an ASUS TUF Gaming laptop that it says is just about perfect for this sort of use case: the TUF Dash F15. This laptop has an Intel Core i7-12650H processor with 10 cores and 16 threads with Hyper Threading on its six P cores alongside a GeForce RTX 3070 with 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM. It actually looks like a rather svelte gaming laptop with an IPS-level 144 Hz Full HD 1080p display 16GB of dual-channel DDR5 memory and a 512GB SSD in tow.All of this hardware fits in a lightweight and compact footprint too. The TUF Dash F15 has a 15.6"" display so the footprint can only be so small but we were pleasantly surprised at the system's portability. This laptop weighs in at 4.4 pounds or right at 2 kilograms and has three very thin bezels. The way the hinge is designed helps the display sit a little higher than some ultraportables but it lends itself to being more comfortable for long periods of time. The build quality is very solid too; the TUF Dash F15 is made from a polycarbonate body but there's very little flex and it feels nice in the hands.In a dorm or on a desk at home students might opt for a dock discrete monitor and separate keyboard and mouse but in a classroom setting there's no avoiding a built-in keyboard or trackpad. Fortunately the TUF Dash F15 is nicely outfitted with a backlit keyboard with enough travel and tactile response to be comfortable while typing. The WASD block's keys are white which makes them easy to find while gaming in a dimly-lit room although for most engineering-focused apps that's a little superfluous. Below the keyboard the track pad has generous proportions with built-in button clicks and support for multi-touch gestures.The thing is students don't even have to pony up for quite that much hardware if they don't want to. NVIDIA recommends a whole host of configurations reaching down to Core i5 and Ryzen 5-based systems with GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs all the way up to the heavy hitters with Core i7 or Ryzen 7 H-series processors and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics. The company generally recommends 16GB or more of system memory and a speedy SSD but we encourage students to look at the apps they'll be working with and use their system requirements as a guide. Regardless the TUF Dash F15 should have plenty of horsepower for just about any student workload we're talking about today.Because students need to have their PCs with them in class we're definitely talking about portable laptops. Desktop replacements like MSI's GE76 Raider are incredibly fast and really nice but they're kind of heavy to lug around from class to class and battery life won't be ideal. Desktops certainly have their place too but it's awfully hard to lug one into a lecture setting. Instead NVIDIA is focusing its STEM Student program on modestly-sized machines with high-performance graphics like the TUF Dash F15. Our test unit direct from ASUS costs around $1800 which is a far cry cheaper than mobile workstations with Quadro graphics while still having plenty of capabilities to get the job done. More mid-rang configurations of this machine are available at retail for just over $1000 All of this hardware is great but if it doesn't have a tangible benefit for students the money used to buy it may be better spent elsewhere. To help us evaluate performance our TUF Dash F15 came pre-loaded with MATLAB 2022a and SolidWorks 2022 with some sample projects for testing. Testing for SolidWorks a very popular suite of CAD tools was done with the publicly-available Black Owl model from the GrabCAD community with MSAA enabled. For MATLAB which is a programming platform used by engineers for algorithm development and data analysis we used the N-Body Simulation Navier-Stokes incompressible fluid equations and Particle System test projects all of which are downloadable directly from MathWorks.Testing with the integrated graphics of the TUF Dash F15 resulted in very low frame rates although the application wasn't ever sluggish or slow to respond. On the other hand the GeForce RTX 3070 added a lot of extra oomph to the application animating the scene at over 80 frames per second. The GeForce added a lot of extra performance which should make SolidWorks easier to use and won't slow down users trying to get models created. Turning off MSAA would make the integrated GPU perform better but zooming out on the model made it noticeably blockier.In MATLAB we found that the GPU added quite a speed-up in both of our projects. The benchmarks have options for running the simulation either on the GPU or on the CPU and the values displayed in each is expressed in seconds or more aptly fractions of a second. In the above screenshots we could compute .05 seconds as 50 milliseconds which works out to an instantaneous frame rate of 40 fps by dividing 1000 (which is the equivalent of one second) by the number of milliseconds. Therefore the lower numbers for the GPU in these screenshots are better because they completed each pass of the simulation more quickly.when run on the GeForce RTX 3070. Slower GPUs would give less of an uptick but the middle tier of GeForce added quite a bump.Obviously NVIDIA is heavily invested in machine learning too so we then turned our attention to GPU-accelerated AI workloads. NVIDIA's Jetpack SDK is meant for use with Linux rather than Windows 11 like our system shipped with so we used the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version 2 and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. This Docker container along with close-to-the-metal access to the GeForce GPU in our TUF Dash F15 allowed us to run the some of the same machine learning benchmarks that we ran on the Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit The machine learning benchmarks can run on integrated GPUs and CPUs as well so those results are included alongside the GeForce RTX 3070 which obviously ran them much much faster. We didn't expect quite THIS much difference though; theand its Intel HD Graphics integrated GPU was on its own.NVIDIA's Jetpack software development kit (SDK) is a mature feature-full toolkit for accessing all of the machine learning acceleration tools built into recent GeForce GPUs. The Tensor cores of Turing and Ampere GPUs are adept at low-precision math usually 16-bit operations required for training and inference of AI models. The thing about Jetpack however is that it's designed and only available for Linux. Fortunately Windows 11 has a fast and compatible software layer in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) specifically version 2. NVIDIA's documentation includes a guide on setting up WSL2 and installing the required Docker containers so that developers (and computer science students) can get up and running without dual booting.Once we got everything set up we could run an image processing benchmark to recognize objects within images. We could also use DirectML on Anaconda to run the benchmarks on non-NVIDIA hardware like the Core i7-12650H and UHD Graphics processor. This does require disabling discrete GPUs otherwise DirectML will run on the GeForce RTX 3070 GPU in the laptop. The benchmark runs in a loop and so we let it run for about 20 minutes on both configurations before collecting results.We did expect the TUF Dash F15 to blow past the Core i7-12650H because the GeForce RTX 3070 has dedicated hardware cores for accelerating these types of workloads but the difference was much more stark than we expected. The while the Intel integrated graphics could only handle about 15 using the same set of images. or greater than 2700% of the performance of the Intel platform. Having dedicated hardware is a big deal in machine learning workloads and that's incredibly apparent here.NVIDIA also includes a Jupyter server for running Notebooks based on RAPIDS NVIDIA's Cuda-X AI development tools. There are a handful of Notebooks available in NVIDIA's sample code. We chose the dimensionality reduction comparison. Dimensionality reduction is a technique for representing a dataset in a high-dimensional space in a lower-dimensional space without losing important properties of the data. Think of it this way: if your dataset's visualization is large spatially it's hard to work with and it can be difficult to understand. So you can group that data in meaningful ways that convey what's important to the data. The decomposition Notebooks generate around 100000 records and then employ 30 different methods to visualize a sparse dataset providing a way for a reader to contextualize the results.There are two Notebooks for this test one for the CPU and one for using RAPIDS to run it on the GeForce RTX 3070. On the Core i7 CPU in our TUF Dash F15 notebook the test took around 125 seconds to complete. When run on the GPU providing a 15x performance increase. 100000 records may not be all that much data depending on the task at hand but the result seems clear: data scientists trying to understand and visualize datasets would do well to run these algorithms on a GPU since the time it saves is valuable.Of course NVIDIA also has Maxine a deep learning SDK for both Linux and Windows that focuses on video and audio applications. If you've ever used NVIDIA Broadcast to clean up webcam output or enhance microphone audio then you've used an app based on Maxine. There's also an augmented reality SDK as part of Maxine which uses those audio and video components as a base. Without AR headsets that's kind of hard to test but we could take the video processing tools for a spin.We used the Body Track sample application and the built-in webcam of the TUF Dash F15. The idea is that as the camera collects image data the AI can draw a wireframe tracking our movements and draw a wireframe of where it thinks my body is and the pose I'm in.At first I was wearing one of my trademark plaid shirts and the high-contrast pattern really threw off the AI thinking I was an amorphous blob of boneless flesh. Once I changed my shirt it started to figure out what I was doing and could track my movements much more easily. No doubt that with a better camera or more data the application could do a better job of high-contrast color tracking but the sample does what it was designed to do: get the idea across. The code for the app is all written in C++ using NVIDIA's Maxine APIs for collecting frame data and then parsing it into the various objects and drawing over the body. The fact it can do this in real-time is pretty outstanding.NVIDIA has loads of other samples and demos plus tons of other APIs for the various stages of AI robotics and conversational AI. We did take the RIVA real-time voice AI for a spin when we looked at the Jetson AGX Orin developer kit and the results spoke for themselves then. The functionality is just as seamless and fast on the TUF Dash F15: start talking and the machine learning models do the rest. If you'd like to see it in action check out the demo we recorded earlier this year.Students are going to need some general purpose applications as well so next we're going to take a look at system performance. Battery life is important when going from class to class too so we'll also take a peek at battery life. Head on over to the next page for more on this portable powerful machine...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVkZXZlbG9wZXIuY29tL2dhbWUtcGxhdGZvcm1zL2V2Z2EtZW5kcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLWFuZC1pdHMtbnZpZGlhLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA ends production of graphics cards and its NVIDIA partnership,"PC component maker EVGA announced on Friday it'll no longer be making next-gen graphics cards and in fact is getting out of graphics cards entirely as its longtime partnership with NVIDIA is coming to an end. In separate interviews with JayZTwoCents and Gamers Nexus that were spotted by Tom's Hardware CEO Andrew Han alleged NVIDIA had gradually eroded the relationship between the two companies.



""EVGA will not carry the next generation graphics cards"" it wrote on its forums. It added that it would continue to support and sell ""existing current generation products.""

NVIDIA is one of the hardware pillars of the video game industry and Han's allegations are a serious claim about how the company does business.

Han alleged that NVIDIA failed to provide EVGA information about products like the RTX 3080 graphics card. EVGA's own high end cards for the RTX 3080 and 3090 he added had to be sold at a loss of ""hundreds of dollars"" so as to be competitive with NVIDIA's Founders Edition cards.

EVGA creates various PC components such as motherboards and power supplies. It's also been a partner with NVIDIA for years producing GeForce and RTX 30-series video cards.



A spokesperson for NVIDIA released a statement stating it ""had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products. We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.""

Senior management for EVGA elected to finally terminate its partnership with NVIDIA back in April according to Han. The component maker will remain in business its staff will be reallocated to different projects to avoid layoffs. The company is expected to run out of stock for its RTX 30-series cards by year's end with extra stock being held onto for the purpose of service and repairs.

It's hard to blame EVGA for its decision to leave the graphics card market. Between supply chain issues with the RTX 3080 and similar cards plus graphics cards being used to mine cryptocurrency the graphics card market has been incredibly messy in recent years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNzAtdGktZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1zb29uLWdldC1hLWJpZy11cGdyYWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti graphics card could soon get a big upgrade,"Nvidia could be preparing a new spin on the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti going by the latest leak concerning Team Green’s graphics cards.

This one was aired by prominent leaker @harukaze5719 on Twitter (as highlighted by Wccftech) who spotted a new RTX 3070 Ti variant listed by Gigabyte with the EEC (Eurasian Economic Commission).

GV-N307TGAMING OC ST-16GDGV-N307TGAMING OC ST-8GDGV-N3070GAMING OC ST-8GDGV-N306TGAMING OC ST-8GDGV-N3060GAMING OC ST-12GDhttps://t.co/YaZRx1VrPoSeptember 17 2022

Among of bunch of listings for some other cards – mainly existing models but there could be a twist on that we’ll come back to that later – there’s one for a ‘GV-N307T GAMING OC ST-16GD’ which translates to a Gigabyte RTX 3070 Ti Gaming OC graphics card with 16GB of VRAM.

As you may be aware the RTX 3070 Ti version that currently exists is limited to 8GB of video RAM – the same amount as the RTX 3070 – so this possible refresh on the graphics card is doubling that up a major memory upgrade.

Interestingly we have seen Gigabyte previously file an RTX 3070 Ti 16GB version with the EEC right back at the start of the year. Obviously that never happened but it looks like the plan may be back in the cards…

Analysis: More evidence of how Nvidia’s ‘layering’ strategy might work?

That previous EEC filing underlines why we should always be suitably skeptical around leaks like this. Just because a graphics card model appears at the EEC – something that normally happens when the product is close to release – does not mean it’ll necessarily hit the shelves. Sometimes speculative filings are made with the organization placeholder entries that don’t come to fruition as we saw with the previous 3070 Ti 16GB from Gigabyte.

That doesn’t mean it won’t happen this time round of course and the big ‘however’ here is that we recently heard chatter on the grapevine about a refresh of the RTX 3070 Ti which uses the GA102 GPU (the higher-end chip which is the engine of the RTX 3080 and 3090) rather than the GA104 which drives the RTX 3070 Ti currently.

And when rumors back each other up like this they gain a bit more credibility – although we’re still remaining very cautious on this one. It’s also worth noting that the previous rumor suggests that the new spin on the RTX 3070 Ti could be limited to one region perhaps (China maybe). Furthermore the past leak didn’t mention upping the VRAM either (though we could even get a version with doubled VRAM and that new GA102 chip).

That last rumor also pushed the notion that Nvidia is readying not just an RTX 3070 Ti variant but an RTX 3060 with 8GB of VRAM (rather than 12GB). Now the EEC filing from Gigabyte does not show this purported refresh – there is a new 3060 card listed but still with 12GB. So make of that what you will but there was also talk of an RTX 3060 Ti with faster GDDR6X memory – 8GB in this case which is the standard loadout with the current graphics card – and a new RTX 3060 Ti model is listed here. So maybe that’s a version with the aforementioned pepped-up VRAM.

Ultimately we can’t be sure about any of this but what we can say is that rumors are increasingly pointing to Nvidia at least putting out one or two fresh versions of its existing Ampere graphics cards (possibly as soon as next month).

This would appear to be part of the overall near future GPU rollout strategy for Team Green as the company has said that it intends to layer current-gen offerings with next-gen. And with high-end RTX 4000 graphics cards coming first likely the RTX 4090 and 4080 it makes sense that the RTX 3070 and 3060 would be the layered refreshes to tide things over until their Lovelace successors turn up maybe not until 2023.

The RTX 4060 certainly isn’t expected until next year and the more we hear the more we’re thinking this might be the case for the RTX 4070 with Nvidia purportedly considering pushing out two quite different versions of the RTX 4080 one of which could be in lieu of the 4070 in theory. Admittedly that’d be something of an odd move but we won’t have long to wait to find out if it’s true – Nvidia’s big reveal for next-gen Lovelace GPUs is only a couple of days away now."
O,Realty Income,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2hlcmVzLXdoeS1yZWFsdHktaW5jb21lLWlzLWEtbm8tYnJhaW5lci1kaXZpZGVuZC1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Realty Income Is a No-Brainer Dividend Stock,"This reliable business has withstood the test of time.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O 0.70%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

With its 4.4% dividend yield and monthly dividend payouts investors in search of passive income can't go wrong with Realty Income stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvcmVhbHR5LWluY29tZS1mcnQtMi1yZWl0cy13aXRoLXVucGFyYWxsZWxlZC1kaXZpZGVuZC10cmFjay1yZWNvcmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realty Income FRT: 2 REITs with Unparalleled Dividend Track Records - TipRanks.com,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvcmVhbHR5LWluY29tZS1mcnQtMi1yZWl0cy13aXRoLXVucGFyYWxsZWxlZC1kaXZpZGVuZC10cmFjay1yZWNvcmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C0E20>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But when they're utilized as a part of a larger Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative they become even more valuable.

Over the years ERGs have become more widespread with almost 90% of Fortune 500 companies utilizing them as of 2016 according to a Bentley University report. This is likely because ERGs address inequities in the organization from the ground up and the issues highlighted come directly from the people affected by them.

What are Employee Resource Groups?

At their simplest ERGs are groups of people within an organization who share a common interest or concern. They are meant to provide an opportunity for like-minded employees to collaborate and address issues that arise within the organization.

Jennifer Williamson the global senior DEI Consultant at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals provides support and guidance to the ERGs at Regeneron. She told BioSpace that ERGs help not only the employees but the organization as a whole.

“They keep employees engaged and provide opportunities for networking personal development and professional development” Williamson explained adding that ERGs also allow employers to receive valuable feedback about policies and practices that they may never hear otherwise.

Quinnie Wong the DEI leader at Pfizer agrees. At BioSpace’s recent Building a Culture of Inclusion panel Wong emphasized that while ERGs can create a bond among employees they can also help employees reach their full potential.

“A lot of times these employee resource groups also act as a sounding board. They create ideas to help drive the business” Wong said. “It's not just about people who have the same affinity coming together and creating that bond. It’s also about unleashing that potential to help drive the business.”

How to Start a Successful ERG

Though the concept of an ERG sounds simple enough an ERG has to be implemented and run in the right way in order to be successful. Williamson told BioSpace that if an organization or group of employees attempts to start an ERG without the proper planning it could have the opposite effect instead becoming a place for employees to voice their complaints without any action or resolution taking effect.

For those looking to start their own ERGs Williamson’s advice is clear: make a plan.

“Making sure they have a very clear mission making sure they have very clear objectives making sure they have very clear outcomes that they're looking for and making sure that they are getting the support from the organization…if that support is not in place in the worst case scenario it could actually lead to employee disengagement.”

One of the most important steps in establishing an ERG is identifying an executive sponsor. This volunteer serves as the voice of the group presenting the group’s concerns and plans to the company’s leadership.

The executive sponsor is charged with planning and organizing events and meetings for the ERG. They also keep track of any tangible changes the group makes to the organization. The sponsor then presents this data and information to the company’s executives to show how the ERG is aligned with helping the business reach its goals.

Both Wong and Williamson agreed that a successful executive sponsor should be someone who is already in a leadership or management position. It’s best if the sponsor chosen already has the leadership skills and influence to make necessary policy changes based on the concerns of the group.

For smaller organizations finding a higher-up who is already part of the organization may prove difficult. However Wong stated that as long as they have the group’s interests in mind the sponsor doesn’t have to share the exact same struggles as the rest of the group.

“The sponsor may not even be part of the affinity for that employee resource group” Wong said. “And sometimes that's even better because now we have a strong ally for that community. And that community can also educate the senior leader on things are highly relevant and important to the community.”

Who Can Join an ERG?

At their core ERGs are made for minorities or those who may not be widely represented within the organization.

Because they are meant to address issues that organization leaders may not be aware of ERGs can be formed for employees who identify as racial and ethnic minorities as well as those with physical disabilites mental health concerns and more.

Some who are looking to establish an ERG within their organization may worry about how others who are left out of these groups will respond.

This is where allies–those who support the members in the group but do not identify in the same way–come in.

By providing a space for these employees to voice their concerns those employees become more engaged in the company overall. And allowing allies to be part of the conversation gives them the opportunity to learn from and interact with people they may not encounter in their personal lives leading to a greater sense of camaraderie and understanding across the board.

What Can a Successful ERG Accomplish?

ERGs are beneficial for both employees and for the business as a whole. Here are just a few of the benefits ERGs can provide.

Benefits for employees:

Mentorship and sponsorship

Opportunities for professional development

Camaraderie inclusion and a sense of community

A safe place to voice concerns

Resources to make their workplace more inclusive

Benefits for the organization:

Higher employee retention rates

Greater productivity

A release of untapped potential

Team-building

Valuable input and feedback from employees

The Takeaway

Though ERGs are just one aspect of a successful DEI plan they can be one of the most effective ways to spark change within an organization. The power and influence of these groups is why it’s so important to have a plan in place with specific goals in mind before the ERGs are formed.

The ultimate goal of any DEI initiative is to increase employee engagement and inclusion. And according to Williamson a successful ERG can help an organization fulfill its DEI goals in a more efficient way.

“Through the events and activities that the ERGs do they help to educate others. They are your local diversity champions” Williamson said. “So you are developing a cadre of diversity champions that help the organization move that along at a much quicker rate.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYmlvdGVjaC5ldS90cmVuZHMtbmV3cy9kdXBpeGVudC10cmlhbC1zaG93cy1wb3NpdGl2ZS1yZXN1bHRzLWluLWNoaWxkcmVuLXdpdGgtZGVybWF0aXRpcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dupixent phase 3 trial shows positive results in children with dermatitis,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.labiotech.eu', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /trends-news/dupixent-trial-shows-positive-results-in-children-with-dermatitis/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FA700A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYmlvdGVjaC5ldS90cmVuZHMtbmV3cy9kdXBpeGVudC10cmlhbC1zaG93cy1wb3NpdGl2ZS1yZXN1bHRzLWluLWNoaWxkcmVuLXdpdGgtZGVybWF0aXRpcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Introduction

Ghana’s economy like many others is still recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.1 Despite this the mobile money industry in Ghana enjoyed a big boost during the pandemic. In 2018 Ghana launched one of the first interoperable systems in Africa which allows transactions between different telecom service providers in Ghana; reports reveal that the interoperability-supported payments reached 308 million Ghanaian cedis (GH₵) ($57 million) by 2019.2 Since then mobile money has risen to become the most popular digital financial service (DFS) in Ghana and in recent years Ghana has been identified as one of the biggest mobile money markets and the fastest-growing one in Africa.3 The Bank of Ghana reported in 2021 that mobile money accounts which numbered 32.7 million in February 2020 grew to number 40.9 million by February 2021.4 Mobile money service provides users with electronic accounts linked to their phone numbers from which they can store send and receive money.5 The simplicity of this service coupled with the convenience it offers has made it an ideal DFS solution for many Ghanaians but there are also many challenges—including cyber crime the need for infrastructure and digital capacity and government policies such as the new Electronic Transactions Levy (or “e-levy”) and digital ID systems—that have inhibited digital financial inclusion (DFI).6 This paper discusses the state of DFI in Ghana and the regulatory framework for DFS with particular attention paid to mobile money services as the major DFS player in the country and to the government’s digital security strategies in relation to DFS.

The Digital Financial Landscape in Ghana

The emergence of digital financial services and inclusion in Ghana arguably began when the Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) was established in 2007.7 As a foundation for financial inclusion GhIPSS which is an interbank payment and settlement company was tasked with creating and managing interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and other financial institutions.8 Essentially it was created to provide the technology to help Ghana become a cashless society.

In April 2008 GhIPSS rolled out a novel national switch and smart card payment system dubbed e-Zwich.9 E-Zwich is a biometric smart card connected to all financial institutions in Ghana that allows users to deposit withdraw and transfer money.10 The card was targeted at the unbanked in Ghana who amounted to a staggering 80 percent of the country’s population at the time.11 Unlike opening a bank account which required documentation like letters of employment recommendation and guarantor letters or proof of address in the form of water or electricity bills e-Zwich simply requires a user’s fingerprints. E-Zwich cardholders benefit from high security standards through the biometric (fingerprint) client authentication system. Card users were not restricted to banking halls but could transact at any location that had an e-Zwich point of sale (POS) device. The POS devices were available in all banks some shops and e-Zwich merchant stalls. The introduction of the e-Zwich system promoted DFI and Ghana’s digital economy but because of various challenges the e-Zwich began to suffer decline after it commenced operations.12 Some users and merchants began to experience failed transactions and other technological issues at the POS locations leaving them unable to withdraw money or continue other transactions due to poor and unstable cellular networks on which transactions relied.13 Despite the difficulties with e-Zwich GhIPSS has continued to play a crucial role for payment systems. All DFS providers in Ghana from banks and telecom companies to fintech companies are partnered with GhIPSS. The interoperability that GhIPSS introduced in 2018 made mobile money more seamless convenient and cost-effective across all networks.14

A notable catalyst to mobile money’s debut in Ghana was the Branchless Banking Guidelines issued by the Bank of Ghana in 2008 to encourage deposit-taking financial institutions (banks and non-banks) to pursue branchless banking.15 The guidelines were issued with the primary aim of promoting financial inclusion by extending core banking and financial services outside of banking halls to provide these services to the unbanked.16 The Branchless Banking Guidelines also acknowledged that to accomplish branchless banking financial institutions would need the help of agents to distribute or retail the services offered. Telecommunication companies (telcos) were seen as potential agents especially for mobile banking.17 The guidelines however made the point that the use of agents or third-party service providers did not remove the responsibility of banks to ensure that operating branchless banking does not compromise banking standards.18 Focused on the financial inclusion objective the guidelines also established that the only permissible model to operate branchless banking was a “many to many model” which prevents exclusive partnerships between financial institutions and agents.19

Although the potential role of telcos was considered in the guidelines it was limited to that of agents for the financial institutions. It is evident that the Bank of Ghana hoped that financial institutions would pioneer the cause of DFI through branchless banking; instead the telcos have championed the change and made significant contributions to DFI in Ghana especially through the introduction and advancement of mobile money services. The good reception mobile money received in the Ghanaian market unarguably influenced the commencement of other digital financial services in the country.

Financial technology (fintech) is also a growing industry that is offering innovative financial services to Ghanaians. Zeepay Ghana Limited is currently Ghana’s most successful fintech company. Founded in 2014 and wholly Ghanaian-owned Zeepay received its dedicated electronic money issuer license in 2020.20 Zeepay essentially provides a single wallet in which customers can receive payments via different digital channels like money remittance bank transfer and mobile money. Customers can also withdraw from Zeepay agents if they choose. Zeepay operating in over twenty countries globally has partnered with all three mobile money operators and some banks for flexible payments remittances and transfers and it is a major DFS player in Ghana. Zeepay is also licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom.21 ExpressPay is another growing fintech player in Ghana that allows users to conveniently pay various types of bills online and to send monies instantly to any bank account making the tedious process of bank-to-bank transfers much simpler.22 Launched in 2018 Bitsika is also creating a platform that uses digital currencies to move money across borders at low or zero cost. Users can deposit and remit money across multiple currencies using the Bitsika app. By using digital currencies and distributed ledger technology Bitsika is making cross-border payments instant and auditable at negligible costs.23

The Growth of Mobile Money as the Leading DFS in Ghana

In compliance with the Branchless Banking Guidelines MTN—Ghana’s largest telecommunications service provider—partnered with nine banks and launched mobile money services in July 2009.24 Under the guidelines it only had the capacity to be an agent of the banks. All mobile money accounts opened with MTN were linked to one of these nine banks. MTN invested heavily in creating awareness of the service by sending merchants to the unbanked and underserved areas of the country to educate about and market mobile money.25 All the merchants who penetrated the unbanked geography of Ghana were from partner banks who had shown interest in those areas. Each mobile money account registered by a merchant represented an account of the bank the merchant worked for. Registering customers and opening accounts however presented another hurdle. Customers had to present a valid national ID to be registered which was a hindrance to the registration process for many.26 Registrations had to be a scheduled event rather than a service that could be undertaken immediately once a customer expressed interest in the service.27 Despite this some factors made mobile money accounts preferable to traditional bank accounts for the unbanked. They had lesser know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and were less expensive to use.28 Merchants were also more accessible to the unbanked reaching some rural areas. By October 2009 MTN had about 20000 registered mobile money subscribers.29 However MTN could not operate mobile money at the scale and in the manner it wanted because a majority of the operational decisions were made by the partner banks.30

Upon reviewing the Branchless Banking Guidelines the Bank of Ghana issued the Guidelines for E-Money Issuers and Agent Guidelines in 2015. These guidelines replaced the Branchless Banking Guidelines and set out new protocols for mobile money operations.31 According to the Bank of Ghana the guidelines were issued as part of its broader strategy to create an enabling regulatory environment for efficient and safe digital payment and funds transfer mechanisms and to “promote the availability and acceptance of electronic money as a retail payment medium with the potential to increase financial inclusion.”32 The E-Money Issuer Guidelines introduced the status of Dedicated Electronic Money Issuer (DEMI) which an institution could obtain by getting a license to issue e-money alongside licensed financial institutions.33 This gave telcos an opportunity to gain the capacity to issue money to customers for transactions without linking each mobile money account to a bank account. The E-Money Issuer Guidelines set out standards of systems and controls as well as technology and security requirements DEMIs should use. It also set out general operational provisions for DEMIs including types of mobile money accounts transaction limits permissible transactions KYC requirements capital and liquid fund requirements and consumer protection principles among others.34 Many of these requirements and operational rules have been incorporated into the Payment Systems Act 2019 (Act 987) which currently regulates digital financial service providers.

The Agent Guidelines essentially changed the meaning of “agent” from the meaning outlined in the Branchless Banking Guidelines and provided new operational guidelines to complement the new e-money guidelines and payment systems structure the Bank of Ghana was putting into place. The practical effect of the 2015 guidelines released the telcos from the position of agents and gave them the option to be principals in the relationship. Although telcos are no longer required to be agents of banks beneficial partnerships still exist between telcos and some banks to facilitate transactions between mobile money accounts and bank accounts and payments for services.

MTN’s success in venturing into mobile money services and the enabling regulatory environment inspired the other mobile networks operators in Ghana to follow suit. Tigo Cash was launched in October 2010 Airtel Money in 2011 and Vodafone Cash in 2015.35 In 2017 Airtel and Tigo merged to create AirtelTigo which also resulted in .36 By 2019 mobile phones officially became the most-used medium of payment in Ghana due to mobile money and mobile banking.37 Mobile money dominated the landscape with 32.5 million registered accounts (from 23.9 million in 2018) and 13 million active users at the end of 2018 (see figure 1).38

MTN Ghana has made the largest contribution to DFI in Ghana not only by introducing mobile money but also by providing the largest amount of coverage. MTN Ghana also set up MobileMoney Limited a subsidiary responsible for mobile financial services. With a market share of over 80 percent since 2017 MTN continues to dominate the mobile money market to date.39 The Ministry of Communications and Digitalisation (MOCD) revealed in 2020 that MTN controlled 75 percent of the telecom market labeling it a significant market power (SMP).40 The MOCD also revealed that MTN controlled about 94 percent of the mobile money market share because the other telcos pay interconnect fees to MTN.41 MTN’s SMP designation enables the National Communications Authority (NCA) to enforce the provisions of the Electronic Communications Act 2008 such as setting a price floor or ceiling for associated mobile money costs so as to maintain a competitive market and level the playing field for all telcos.

AirtelTigo on the other hand was the result of a merger to create a stronger telecommunications network. However in 2020 the parent companies of the entity opted to sell their shares to the government.42 Since the sale was completed in November 2021 it remains to be seen whether operating under the government’s management will be to AirtelTigo’s detriment or success. The government’s previous failure to successfully manage the first government-owned telco Ghana Telecom resulted in the privatization of Ghana Telecom which is now Vodafone Ghana. Vodafone Ghana has also made efforts to increase financial inclusion by allowing Vodafone Cash users to send and deposit money without any charges since 2020.43 This initiative was made possible due to mobile money interoperability.44 Vodafone became the first player in the industry to introduce a free peer-to-peer service to enhance commercial advantage and allow for more financial inclusion.

The Regulatory Environment

The Bank of Ghana has supervisory and regulatory authority over banks and all other financial institutions and it oversees their licensing and operation through the various acts of parliament that relate to financial services. The Banking Supervision Department of the Bank of Ghana oversees banks while the Other Financial Institutions Supervision Department oversees financial institutions that are not banks. The Payments Systems Department oversees the financial activities and in particular the mobile money operations of telcos. That department also undertakes licensing monitoring and onboarding for telcos involved in payment systems.45 The Fintech and Innovations Office oversees payment and financial technology service providers. On the other hand rather than being overseen by the Bank of Ghana the telecommunication services provided by telcos are supervised and regulated by the NCA. The NCA regulates telcos by granting licenses for operation ensuring fair competition among licensees monitoring the quality of service setting equipment standards and mandating safeguard mechanisms.

To maintain control over the fast-developing financial sector new and improved legislation has been passed to replace legislation that was determined unsuitable to the current financial services industry. For instance the Payment Systems Act 2003 (Act 662) was replaced with the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 (Act 987). These acts along with the Non-Bank Financial Institution Act 2008 (Act 774) have vested the Bank of Ghana with powers to license regulate and supervise financial sector developments. Telcos that operate mobile money services are regarded as payment system providers under the Payment Systems Act (Act 987) meaning that their licensing and regulation fall to the Bank of Ghana.46 The Payment Systems Act is the legislation applicable to DFS or payment system services in Ghana. It consolidates the laws relating to payment systems and payment services and regulates institutions which operate payment services and electronic money business. Under the Payment Systems Act it is a criminal offense to operate a payment service business without a payment service license from the Bank of Ghana.47

In 2016 Ghana also introduced the Banks and Specialised Deposit-Taking Institutions Act 2016 (Act 930) which regulates institutions that engage in deposit-taking business and consolidates laws relating to deposits. While banks and nonbank institutions engaged in deposit-taking business licensed under Act 930 are not required to obtain a license to operate a payment system they must apply for and receive authorization from the Bank of Ghana to offer services.48

Besides Act 987 payment service providers (PSPs) are regulated by other legislation such as the Data Protection Act 2012 (Act 843). Registering with the Data Protection Commission and obtaining a data protection certificate are prerequisites to applying for a PSP license (which in turn is a requirement for businesses to acquire licenses or registration to operate in Ghana). Applicants for a PSP license are additionally required to submit an anti–money laundering policy as part of their application in accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2020 (Act 1044). The policy should outline their KYC processes internal reporting procedures and measures to ensure compliance with the act.

PSPs also submit a cybersecurity policy as part of their license application to the Bank of Ghana that must comply with the Cybersecurity Act 2020 (Act 1038). The submitted cybersecurity policy must detail key performance indicators or strategies that highlight cybersecurity consciousness. The Cybersecurity Act 2020 also established the Cyber Security Authority to regulate cybersecurity activities in Ghana. The board of the authority is constituted by the ministers of communication defense national security and the interior. For good coordination in cybersecurity incidents the authority is required to establish sectoral computer emergency response teams (CERTs) including for the banking and finance sector. Based on conversations with sector practitioners one salient issue is a question of coordination among the sectoral CERTs and the main Cybersecurity Authority; however the Ghana National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GH) which was formed by the MOCD in August 2014 principally to respond to cyber infractions on government networks also serves the private sector.49

Most of the legislation highlighted above were passed recently. The DFS sector in Ghana—despite being quite young—has immense potential and is developing quickly; hence the Bank of Ghana and the government are updating legislation to match developments and ensure secure DFI. Importantly the acts of parliament that regulate the various financial institutions provide consumer and individual-user protections; the enforcement of these protections is one of the many powers of the Bank of Ghana. Ultimately the onus falls on the Bank of Ghana and other regulators and enforcement bodies like the Data Commission and the Cybersecurity Authority to ensure that PSPs are compliant with all relevant legislation and regulation.

Security in DFS in Ghana and Regulation of Mobile Money Operators

In 2017 the financial sector in Ghana underwent massive overhaul as banks and other financial institutions that were unlicensed or noncompliant were shut down by the Bank of Ghana.50 Many depositors of the collapsed institutions were heavily affected and were unable to recover their deposits and investments because of the institutions’ mismanagement.51 However mobile money operations continued. As mobile money grew fraud began to emerge in the sector. The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications reported 278 mobile money–related fraud cases in 2015 and 388 cases in 2016.52 In April 2021 the chamber mentioned that over 4000 cases of mobile money fraud were under investigation.53

Table 1 shows some types of mobile money fraud identified in Ghana.54

Types of Mobile Money Fraud in Ghana TYPE OF FRAUD MEANING 1. Mobile network operator fraud This type of fraud involves employees of telcos and occurs in different forms. Employees can steal from customers' mobile money wallets transfer customers' money unauthorized collude with other fraudsters to swap SIM cards  etc. It generally involves a telco employee manipulating a customer's account without authorization. 2. False promotion fraud Prompts are sent under the guise of a telco promotion and the recipient is asked to input their PIN as a verification measure to claim their ""prize."" The fraudster gains access to the recipient's mobile money account with the PIN that was inputted. 3. Scam messages/reversal of erroneous transactions A fake SMS is sent that indicates a deposit into a customer's account. The fraudster then calls the customer to tell them the deposit was a mistake and to send that amount back. 4. Fortuitous scam Fraudsters pose as delivery companies and call customers under the pretext of delivering goods to them from relatives abroad. Customers will then be instructed to make a deposit to a mobile money account in exchange for delivering the goods.

By 2017 fraud was not an uncommon occurrence among MTN subscribers.55 It was reported that some MTN agents and staff were themselves accomplices to the fraud.56 Some of the few fraud cases police successfully solved involved the arrest of telco employees.57 Telcos in Ghana have been meticulous in ensuring employees or ex-employees who were caught defrauding or stealing from customers are not associated with them. Names of telecommunication companies are not typically disclosed in articles reporting mobile money fraud because financial institutions fear that they will lose customers when they expose their vulnerabilities.58 This also means that there is a culture of limited information-sharing; lack of reporting in turn causes lack of evidence to aid law enforcement in ensuring mitigation of further attacks. However fraud cases are acknowledged publicly by the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunication which is the umbrella association to which all mobile network operators belong.59

While many financial institutions are investing in their cyber defenses unsecure low-cost mobile and internet devices are still a major source of cyber threats to financial institutions.60 DFS providers are still undertaking diverse individualistic digital security efforts. For example to curb fraud MTN has made it mandatory for customers to display a national ID before transacting with any of its agents or merchants. This policy took effect in 2021 amid arguments that it could derail DFI because access to national IDs remains a challenge and that use of IDs for transactions would not help to curb fraud.61

DFS in Ghana Today: Complications Ahead for Inclusion and Security

The success of mobile money and other financial products offered by Zeepay Express Pay and Bitsika represents welcome progress in Ghana’s concerted effort toward DFI. In May 2020 the Ministry of Finance launched the world’s first Digital Financial Services Policy. The policy outlines a vision of DFI.62 Below are features the government aims to see in the Ghanaian digital finance space by 2023:

A holistic digital payment ecosystem for goods and services

Digitized pension payments for all

Digital payment channels maximized by financial services providers

Digitized records for citizens (including record creation retrieval and archiving)

Seamless connectivity between government and private institutions

To accomplish this the government will work in six areas that it refers to as policy pillars. They are governance enabling legislation capacity building market infrastructure digital payment use cases and supporting fintech. Notably the cybersecurity of DFI is not mentioned either as an aim or a pillar. While it can be argued that cybersecurity in relation to DFI services is implied in the above pillars the obvious noninclusion can also be interpreted as an omission or a nonprioritization.

Ghana’s Electronic Transactions Levy

A new development that raises the question of digital financial exclusion is the recent move by the government of Ghana in November 2021 to include in the reading of its 2022 budget a new tax: the e-levy.63 This tax applies a 1.75 percent levy on electronic transactions which include inward remittances bank transfers merchant payments and mobile money payments above GH₵100 (approximately $13) commencing February 1 2022.64 This levy is separate from the fees that telcos already charge customers for transactions. Despite concerns that the e-levy will weaken Ghana’s financial system and slow down the development of e-commerce the government argued that the e-levy was necessitated by a drive to “widen the tax net” which would increase the country’s tax to GDP proportion from about 11.3 percent to over 16 percent and serve as a driving force for Ghana’s economy.65

News of the e-levy was immediately met with great outcry from the public with panic withdrawals occurring a day after the announcement.66 To warm the public to the idea of the levy a number of town hall meetings were held in different parts of the country.67 Initially the Electronic Levy Bill 2021 did not pass Parliament68 and public protests against it continued.69 Notwithstanding the protests and opposition Ghana’s parliament approved the e-levy after members of parliament reintroduced the bill.70 The president thereafter signed the e-levy bill into law effective May 1 2022. An application for an injunction against the e-levy was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Ghana on May 4 2022 meaning that the controversial e-levy is now in force. While the e-levy is not exclusive to mobile money mobile money is the biggest and most clearly affected enterprise in the electronic transactions space. For every transaction from one mobile money wallet to any other recipient source the sender pays an additional 1.75 percent in transaction fees as e-levy. Mobile money is also the reason the e-levy has gained so much media attention since many Ghanaians increasingly rely on mobile money transactions as a primary means for conducting digital finance.

Objectively the e-levy can hinder DFI. It has already created the unintended effect of generating not only panic but also user distrust and insecurity as evidenced by the withdrawals and concerns that fraudsters running social engineering schemes will begin initiating a reversal of the e-levy on mobile money transactions.71 In rural areas especially many people’s mobile money wallet is the closest thing they have to a bank account. It is the primary means by which they send and receive money. The e-levy will certainly discourage such people from sending taxable amounts and will reduce mobile money transactions and encourage people to use cash if there is no viable alternative.

Another reason for the pushback on the e-levy is the double taxation it will inadvertently introduce. For example many employees are paid their salary via mobile money. Paying an additional levy for transactions with money that has been already taxed is burdensome to the average Ghanaian worker. Businesses use merchant mobile money accounts since transactions may involve large sums of money. For enterprises to pay a levy of 1.75 percent—in addition to the usual charges each time a payment above GH₵100 is made—may cause them to reduce transactions and seek a more cost-effective option which may well be cash. However the government has assured citizens that it is in talks with the telcos to ensure the combination of the levy and the transaction fees are not burdensome to the public. Regardless doubts and worries about the levy are far from settled and will inadvertently impact financial inclusion in Ghana.

Cyber Incidents Reporting and Information Sharing

Another curiosity stems from the reporting of fraud incidents. There is a general underreporting of fraud incidents and a dearth of statistics as highlighted above as companies typically fear the loss of customers in the wake of disclosing such incidents. It is very common to leave customers to their fate when they report incidences of fraud thereby passing the burden of security on to consumers and complicating the goal of DFI. Addressing the challenges of fraud was one of the reasons the NCA recently directed all Ghanaians to reregister their SIM cards by presenting their national IDs or Ghana Card to telcos.72 It remains to be seen if the SIM reregistration process will enhance the government’s strategy to police fraud in the financial services sector through filtering SIM cards used for fraudulent purposes.

Digital Identification Systems

Digital identification systems present a challenge for DFI in Ghana.73 Many services in Ghana are dependent on forms of identification that can be digitally verified or authenticated; however this leaves many Ghanaians especially those in the rural areas financially excluded and unable to participate in available digital financial services. The government of Ghana introduced the Ghana Card to document national identity and mandated that from July 1 2022 it would serve as the only ID document required for all financial transactions with institutions under the authority of the Bank of Ghana. To bolster digital identification the government also required that all telcos use Ghana Cards to reregister all SIM cards; however not all Ghanaians have registered for and acquired the Ghana Card.74 Public opinion suggests that the time allotted for the SIM reregistration exercise (October 2021 to March 2022) was overly short and that adequate measures were not put in place to facilitate mass registration while observing appropriate COVID-19 protocols. The National Identification Authority and the NCA have acknowledged that the backlog of unprinted cards uncollected cards and duplicate applications warrants a deadline extension.75 At the time of writing no SIM cards have been deactivated and registration has not been officially ended.

New telco policies also direct that mobile money transactions require proof of identity for conducting transactions.76 Valid forms of ID include a driver’s license voter ID passport Social Security and National Insurance Trust ID National Health Insurance card or Ghana Card (national ID). According to research Ghanaians without formal ID tend to be the poor and those living in rural areas where mobile money is their only access to financial services.77 Obtaining and replacing IDs in Ghana is also hampered by bureaucratic processes which means that new digital ID policies could discourage customers from using mobile money. Linking SIM reregistration to the Ghana Card means that people will be unable to use mobile money services if SIM cards are indeed deactivated for failure to reregister. For enhanced ID policies to advance financial inclusion rather than retard or diminish it the government must ensure that all Ghanaians are registered for and receive the Ghana Card. There can be no DFI without adequate and efficient identification systems. This will further facilitate interoperability enabling people to make different payments in a secure manner through single transactions.

Conclusion

Four challenges continue to hamper digital financial inclusion in Ghana: capacity skills trust and security. To ensure DFI benefits everyone there is a need to provide more than just access; it is important to equip citizens with the capacity skills and trust to go online. Outlined below are areas for improvement within Ghana’s digital financial ecosystem.

Increased cybersecurity enforcement within digital financial ecosystems to ensure resilience against digital technology–related risks: Cybersecurity is important to ensure DFI. However the interface between cybersecurity and economic viability remains a complex policy challenge. Domestic policies and regulations on cybersecurity should be enforced while paying due consideration to issues like DFI; for example the cybersecurity of DFI is not stated as one of the pillars of the trailblazing Ghanaian Digital Financial Services Policy. This is notwithstanding the continued increase in reports of fraudsters targeting mobile money accounts; along with the loss of funds and data privacy and security breaches these incidents risk diminishing trust in digital financial services.78 Ghana’s digital financial policies ought to incorporate cybersecurity if they are to be effective in achieving their lofty goals. Advancing digital inclusion infrastructure: With the rapid expansion of mobile-phone banking in Africa helping to bring financial services to unbanked communities development efforts to advance infrastructure that will enable the functioning of digital systems should be a priority. Factors such as access to internet and electricity are key success determinants for enhancing DFI. Many of Ghana’s financially excluded live in rural areas without access to internet electricity or systems that can function when offline thereby compounding digital divides. Increasing digital capacity skills and trust: Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic digital technology has become more than ever a defining tool for the pursuit of work business and life across the continent and importantly for promoting financial inclusion. The meaningful use of mobile money services requires digital skills literacy accessibility and trust in the digital ecosystem. Digital financial capability is vital to achieving wider policy outcomes such as improving employment health education and economic growth; therefore government must make DFI part of wider government policy and programs. Government must identify where increasing digital financial capability will improve policy outcomes and integrate it into relevant programs. While enhancing digital capability for citizens it is important also to enhance cyber trust so that cyber risks will not be perceived to outweigh the benefits of being financially included. For example since 2017 Ghana has observed National Cybersecurity Awareness Month as an annual event spearheaded by the National Cyber Security Centre of the MOCD to intensify capacity building and awareness creation efforts on cyber hygiene and cybersecurity in Ghana for the general public. Subsequent efforts can embed cross-government digital financial capability and skills programs as part of wider cybersecurity initiatives. Measuring DFI and security through data and research: It is important to agree on a common definition for DFI as well as the identifiers that signify DFI and capabilities. Measuring DFI and the security of services through data and research will provide opportunities for practically implementing and measuring success for the This will also allow government and DFI stakeholders to measure how secure DFI systems are provide a basis to share best practices across DFI sectors and further assist DFI providers to design services in a way that understands the capabilities of their service users and enhances security and trust in services. Improving collaboration and partnership: The key regulatory and security issues raised by DFI relate to consumer protection regulation of digital money and payment systems cyber fraud policing anti–money laundering efforts and measures to counter financing of terrorism.79 While the government continues to play a central role across a range of functions including regulation policymaking and provision of digital infrastructure effective directing of these issues will require multiple sectoral and stakeholder competencies which necessitates effective partnership and collaboration.80 For example activities across other sectors—such as sectoral computer emergency response efforts—should be aligned to government efforts. This will require the Bank of Ghana the NCA market regulators and other relevant authorities to cooperate toward ensuring security of DFS. While Ghanaian financial institutions and telcos continue to collaborate and invest in their sectoral CERTs Ghanaian authorities must establish clear legal and regulatory standards and guidelines to ensure the safety and security of DFS and further enhance security cooperation among sectoral CERTs. Public-private partnership is an imperative for cybersecurity initiatives according to Article 26 of the African Union Convention of Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.81 Such partnership will further assist in identifying best practice initiatives. It is also important to create a support network to use expertise and resources to assist victims of digital financial fraud. The Bank of Ghana along with the financial sector and telcos must also link DFI and cybersecurity into its wider policy programs and make digital financial capacity building and security a core requirement for providers of financial services.

The growth of financial inclusion in Ghana has been mainly due to the development of DFS. Ghana’s DFS and DFI space continues to evolve with the entry of other players like fintech services as well as the new DFS policy which signaled that the government is focused on an agenda that will continue to ensure DFI. However Ghana’s approach to ensuring DFI must leverage cross-sectoral partnerships and whole-of-government collaborations to improve security for DFS as Ghana continues to lead in the West African region by number of mobile money transactions—which represent 82 percent of the country’s GDP—and remains the fastest-growing mobile money market in Africa over the past five years.82

That includes the job being offered the company and the new skills and experiences that they will be exposed to. We would all like more money but the bigger question is will this move open up the next door and is it setting you on the path to be successful over the long haul.

It’s very important that you're taking the time to focus on the background experience and skill sets that you have and how they align to the specific position and organization that to which you are applying. Are they the right for the industry and the organization? In today's day and age it's so easy for individuals to go on and go click click click and apply to three jobs and not consider the consequences.

You should always look at advancement opportunities in your current position which includes exploring possible future roles. This should be part of a long-term strategic vision that makes certain you're doing all the little things to continually advance your career within the company and increase your profile. This includes taking some courses CPE and other development opportunities.

Increasing recession and layoff talk may force some to start looking over their shoulders for a human resources representative but for accounting and finance professionals the anxiety may be misplaced.While it’s still early days for the current economic and employment cycle a massive supply/demand imbalance for accounting talent may translate into a “full employment recession” for both beginning and early career accounting and finance professionals.“The demand has been incredibly high; probably as high as it's ever been in my 24 plus year career” Steve Saah Executive Director of Finance and Accounting Permanent Placement at Robert Half. “All the indicators point to the competitive environment continuing for the accounting and financial workforce for quite some time.”Whether its media or industry economists predictions of a recession and an inevitable increase in unemployment are commonplace. There are already early warning signs coming from Silicon Valley with the tech sector shedding 42000 jobs this year according to Crunchbase Other industries — such as banking — are showing cracks with reports that Goldman Sachs was planning layoffs later this month that could be a harbinger of workforce reductions at other Wall Street firms.The accounting and corporate finance specific impact of the layoffs thus far has been limited focused less and culling current workforce in favor of eliminating job postings or pulling back on projects targeted at finance Saah says that he expects little threat of layoffs in the accounting industry adding that all the relevant statistics — including a unemployment rate for college educated professionals 20 and older of 1.9% — shows a job market that remains crippled more by a supply shortage than a need to reduce its ranks.Beyond the numbers Saah says he is seeing no letup from clients seeking talent.“A lot of times we see a little bit of a downturn during the summer with hiring managers taking vacations or interruptions from summer holidays like Fourth of July” Saah says. “We always see a very natural dip. This year it's been trending upwards and is probably as high as it's been all year long.”Market watchers would argue that in an economic downturn something would “have to give” such as cutting salaries and benefits. But Saah says he compensation and job offers continue to move higher.“Intuitively you would think that compensation would be adjusted down but there is no doubt that finance and accounting salaries are continuing to trend upwards” Saah explains. “Up to this point and certainly for the foreseeable future I actually think that that companies need to be extremely competitive in their total compensation package.”But even in a once in a lifetime job market for accounting and finance. there are strategic issues that early career finance and accounting professionals need to keep in mind Saah adds.Taking the highest offer is not always the best career move.Align your experience to the job.What’s wrong with your current position?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYXdmdWxhbm5vdW5jaW5nLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsL3JvYmVydC1ncmlmZmluLWlpaS1zZXh1YWwtaW5udWVuZG8tZXNwbi1icm9hZGNhc3QuaHRtbNIBZmh0dHA6Ly9hbXAuYXdmdWxhbm5vdW5jaW5nLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsL3JvYmVydC1ncmlmZmluLWlpaS1zZXh1YWwtaW5udWVuZG8tZXNwbi1icm9hZGNhc3QuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Griffin III is a sexual innuendo machine during college football broadcasts,"Robert Griffin III has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the broadcasting ranks. And his propensity to go viral with NSFW quips isn’t hurting his case.

On Saturday Griffin hit the Michigan State Spartans–Washington Huskies audience with two shocking but hilarious sexual innuendos not typically heard on an ESPN broadcast.

Shortly after Michael Penix Jr. drove Washington into the end zone late in the first half Griffin informed play-by-play voice Mark Jones that he came up with a new nickname for the Huskies’ quarterback. “Big Penix energy” said Griffin who sounded delighted with the nickname he erected. “He got big Penix energy.”

Lmao RGIII just said it pic.twitter.com/mQnJsDg3S5 — Ben Ross (@BenRossTweets) September 18 2022

But Griffin’s sexual innuendos didn’t end with reference to the male reproductive anatomy. The former quarterback conjured up another NSFW term during the second half when Michigan State center Nick Samac was flagged for an illegal snap.

“You know what we call that?” Griffin asked his play-by-play partner prompting Jones to innocently but apprehensively respond with “pump fake?” Jones then awaited the answer knowing “pump fake” probably wasn’t in line with what Griffin was thinking.

“Premature snapulation” Griffin said.

BRUH DID @RGIII JUST REALLY SAY THIS ON NATIONAL TV?! “You know what we call that… premature snapulation” pic.twitter.com/pi9cDsfRrg — John // Largest of Truzz (@gochujangpapi) September 18 2022

Keep in mind the college football season is only three weeks old and we already have Griffin on record saying “big Penix energy” “premature snapulation” and shouting “there’s an orgy in the endzone!” after Michigan’s Alex Orji ran for a touchdown. Griffin also made sure to highlight Zach Wilson’s rumored sexual relationship with his mom’s best friend last week while calling the matchup between BYU and Baylor. “He was always committed to the cougars” Griffin said of the former BYU Cougars quarterback.

At this point it doesn’t matter what assignment ESPN hands to the broadcast duo of Griffin and Jones. The former NFL quarterback’s ability to walk the line of NSFW commentary on a Disney-owned production makes their game must-watch TV. (But those trying to slide into his DMs should be aware that his wife Greta runs his social media accounts.)",,,,,,,,,

Bobby Lashley WWE Raw Match,"WWE Hall Of Famer Praises Seth Rollins Vs. Bobby Lashley WWE Raw Match

The Seth Rollins vs. Bobby Lashley United States Title match that opened the 9/19 episode of ""WWE Raw"" has been widely praised on social media.

The match was filled with near falls and creative counter maneuvers especially the spot where Rollins turned Lashley's Spear attempt into a pedigree. There was also a spot in the match where Lashley blocked a Stomp attempt from Rollins only to power up and clothesline his opponent out of the ring!

As the two veteran wrestlers continued to exchange near falls Lashley seemed to have the match won when he locked in the Hurt Lock. However Rollins would capitalize on the referee getting accidentally knocked down by low-blowing Lashley before nailing the Stomp on the U.S. Champion. Just then Matt Riddle charged down the ring causing just enough distraction for Lashley to nail the spear on Rollins for the pinfall victory.

WWE Hall of Famer Brian ""Road Dogg"" James heaped praise onto both men for their efforts while also tweeting his approval of WWE's production crew.

""What a great match! Best match So far! #WWERaw great camera angles to tell two different stories at once"" Road Dogg wrote on Twitter.

With ""WWE Raw"" facing stiff competition from two ""Monday Night Football"" games the placement of the Rollins vs. Lashley match – at the start of the show – seemed like a strategic move. The match was followed by Damage CTRL's championship celebration with Kevin Owens vs. Austin Theory rounding off the first hour.

Meanwhile the Rollins vs. Riddle rematch is now confirmed for the Extreme Rules premium live event on October 8.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Related California the Irvine-based affiliate of New York-based Related Companies has filed plans to build the 42-acre project at 3694 S Plaza Dr. the Orange County Business Journal reported.

The project dubbed Related ­Bristol would replace the 460000-square-foot Metro Town Square which includes a Vons supermarket Ross Dress for Less and a Bed Bath & Beyond at Bristol Street and MacArthur Boulevard.

Related has agreed to assume a 99-year ground lease for the shopping center owned by the Callens family for more than a century.

Plans for the 3750 apartments 200 senior housing units 350000 square feet of offices shops and restaurants and a 250-room hotel. Pending approvals Related could break ground in 2026 and complete the project in phases by 2036.

The first phase would include the 250-room “premium” hotel a 20-story tower with a 200-unit senior assisted living facility plus a 47000-square-foot grocery store to replace the Vons. A tree-lined paseo would be accessible to cars with a pedestrian trail throughout.

Thirteen acres would be set aside as open space with plazas and parks to serve as community gathering hubs.

The center’s residential development is expected to be mixed-income with rental units favored over for-sale homes. The number of affordable homes if any was not disclosed.

The development is next to another redevelopment project proposed for the South Coast Plaza Village shopping center by affiliates of C.J. Segerstrom & Sons based in Costa Mesa. Together they could add 5000 homes plus retail between Sunflower Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.

Related Bristol is being billed as a “new gateway into Santa Ana.”

Its replacement of the aging shopping center points toward a retail shift toward ecommerce according to developers. Metro Town Square has nearly 100 tenants with all of the leases expiring in 2025.

A quarter of the shopping center is made up of big-box retailers Ross Dress which plans to close as part of a corporate restructuring and Bed Bath & Beyond which announced plans to shutter 150 stores nationwide.

At the same time the thought of getting a tattoo to signify the eternal importance of whatever it is your celebrating makes you nervous.

Say hello to permanent jewelry and yes you can get right here in Amarillo.

A Welder's Dream Side Hustle

Permanent jewelry recently came across my radar thanks to some people I know who decided to go do the deed to celebrate a birthday. When they mentioned getting permanent jewelry I imagined some kind of implant or semi-unconformable procedure.

Stones and Findings via YouTube Stones and Findings via YouTube loading...

The truth isn't quite as ""exciting"" as blood and needles. However this next part will catch the attention of blue collar workers.

They're welded. That's how they go from jewelry to permanent jewelry.

A Quick Zap And You've Got Bling For Life...Is Bling Still A Word?

It's a fairly simple process. You pick out the chain you want and then the person who sold you the jewelry zaps it closed with a small welder (one source I found suggests using an arc-welder so don't get too excited).

So while they are technically welded on it's not like there's a massive torch melting these things shut for you to wear for all eternity.

What If You Decide That You Don't Like That Person Anymore?

Simple. Continuing down this unintended rabbit hole I discovered that you can actually remove these things.

The method is so simple that even a toddler could do it.

All you need to do is grab a pair of scissors snip and be free. It's that simple.

Where Can You Get Permanent Jewelry In Amarillo?

There are actually a few different businesses in town that go around doing this. They set up shop in other businesses do private parties show up at events; they're everywhere.

Here's a few I came across:

Another interesting aspect of all of this which I was not expecting to find so interesting but I do is that it's more than just bracelets. Bracelets of course are what I think most people are familiar with. I've seen advertisements for necklaces anklets and even rings.

Also it's not just for the ladies. Apparently this is catching on among fans of male fashion as well.

Mbappé joined as a teenage phenom from Monaco in 2017 in a deal worth 180 million euros ($194 million). On Sunday the 25-year-old superstar played his last home game for PSG and scored in a 3-1 loss to Toulouse.

He was loudly jeered by sections of the crowd at Parc des Princes when his name was announced — two days after finally making it official he is leaving — though Mbappé got a warmer welcome from other PSG fans.

As the soccer world discussed his imminent departure on Friday French champion PSG did not comment on the matter.

The late-evening announcement by Mbappé may have taken PSG by surprise since it was in a video posted on X and not through the club’s communication department.

Between then and the Sunday night kickoff there were more than 20 posts on PSG’s official feed on X.

Those included an exclusive look at next season’s home strip an item on a betting site a clip of PSG’s women’s team reaching the French Cup final and kickoff times for the match in different parts of the world — but nothing on Mbappé.

No tribute was paid to him by the club during Sunday’s game either albeit not the last match of the season.

It was left to the ultra supporters from the CUP or Paris Ultras Collective to honor him with a banner and a giant tifo in his image.

The fracture between the cash-rich Qatari-owned club and its 256-goal record scorer appears to run deep.

Here’s a look at how relations deteriorated.

NEW CONTRACT

PSG may be feeling let down by Mbappé after offering him the most lucrative contract in the club’s history when he signed a new contract in 2022.

But Mbappé was frustrated because he felt promises to sign key players — notably a top-class center forward like Robert Lewandowski so he could play in his favored position wide left — were not kept.

When he signed the new deal he was paraded in front of fans holding up a jersey with 2025 on it. Mbappé was reportedly annoyed about this because the contract was until 2024 with the option for an extra year.

OFFER DECLINED

Mbappé stunned PSG in June last year by informing the club he would not take the option for an extra year. With his contract effectively into its final year it put PSG in the position of needing to sell Mbappé to avoid losing him for free when the contract expired.

PSG insisted he would be sold but Mbappé wanted to see out the final year so the club flexed its muscle by leaving him out of the pre-season tour to Japan in late July.

Al-Hilal came in with a world record $332 million bid but Mbappé was not interested and reportedly refused to meet with representatives from the Saudi club in Paris.

FALLOUT AND TENSIONS

After being left out of the preseason tour Mbappé posted a photo of himself online after training with some fringe players stopping to sign autographs outside the club’s training complex.

The standoff continued when Mbappé was dropped for this season’s opening league game watching from the stands as PSG drew 0-0.

With Lionel Messi gone and Neymar on his way to join Saudi club Al-Hilal PSG coach Luis Enrique simply could not afford to keep overlooking Mbappé. He returned in the next league game and scored a penalty.

TIME TO LEAVE

Relations appeared to be repaired for a while but they took another turn for the worse when Mbappé informed club president Nasser Al Khelaifi in mid-February that he was leaving although he did not go public until Friday.

In between times Mbappé's relationship with Enrique — knowing his best player would be leaving — reportedly became more tense.

Enrique showed his authority in recent weeks by either putting Mbappé on the bench or taking him off during important games.

LOWER STATUS

Mbappé’s near-untouchable status at PSG was suddenly in question.

When Enrique replaced him midway through the second half against bitter rival Marseille on March 31 a surprised Mbappé appeared to mutter something negative as he walked off.

Enrique said he was rotating Mbappé to keep him fresher for the bigger games. They jumped into each other’s arms after PSG knocked Barcelona out of the Champions League quarterfinals with Mbappé scoring twice in the second leg.

But resting Mbappé made no difference in the semifinals against Borussia Dortmund with Mbappé failing to score as PSG lost both games 1-0.

Once again PSG fell short in European soccer’s elite club competition.

Mbappé's last PSG match will be on May 25 in the French Cup final against Lyon.

Text description provided by the architects. This project is a weekend house in the mountains of the Sierra de Arteaga in the state of Coahuila in northern Mexico. The house is laid out on the slope of an old orchard in mountainous surroundings to have minimal impact on the site and natural vegetation. This solution also ensured the best views as the orchard vegetation is much more open and lower than the surrounding forest.

The house is divided into three parts: an elongated 40 m × 10 m rectangle defining enclosed areas of shelter the services at each end and a central social area around the fireplace. All these areas are connected by a long terrace looking directly towards the mountains through a sequence of beams and pillars forming the external structure of the house while framing the natural landscape.

The volume is perforated with courtyards that break up the program and bring natural light inside.

The largest of these contains a staircase leading up to the roof where there are 360-degree views over the valley and the mountains.

The construction comprises exposed concrete walls pillars and beams poured with horizontal formwork metalwork details and large glass panels with aluminum frames. The site also contains a viewpoint and firepit that is independent of the house and an outdoor table seating up to 20 both constructed as concrete monoliths.

The house is understood as a kind of sanctuary where its users move away from the city and meet nature. The house allows them to connect with their natural environment generating a deep awareness of the place resources and the world they inhabit safely and pleasantly.

Although the house belongs to a family the experience of going to their refuge in the mountains generates moments of reflection and self-discovery for each of its members according to their ages their roles and family responsibilities. The house is understood as a refuge and an observatory an instrument to observe the landscape the mountains and the forest and feel the time passing by."

The global training program debuting first in the U.S. and expanding to the U.K. and other regions will provide hands-on training opportunities that help bridge the gap between credentials and job offer extensions.

“What excites us about this program is it’s inclusive and accessible to people of many backgrounds who are looking to enter the consulting world with varying levels of education or career experience” said Harry Datwani principal and U.S. Salesforce alliance leader Deloitte Consulting LLP. “Participants receive hands-on coaching from Deloitte Digital leaders and will complete the program with a broader network and introductions across the Salesforce ecosystem. This experience will give them a jumpstart into their professional journey.”

The Wave program is an expansion of the Salesforce Bootcamp announced earlier this year and will include:

Deloitte Digital sponsored cohorts where trainees can collaborate in sessions with colleagues from similar backgrounds such as military vets mothers returning to work refugees or disabled persons.

Workforce development collaborations that leverage existing programs to teach Salesforce skills and business training needed to obtain technology jobs in the Salesforce ecosystem.

Consulting project simulations where program participants can work on sample projects and scenarios they may encounter during a typical consulting engagement while receiving guidance and feedback from Deloitte Digital professionals.

“The tremendous demand for Salesforce-skilled talent provides us with the opportunity to broaden access to meaningful careers especially in communities historically underrepresented in technology” said Don Lynch senior vice president of worldwide cloud solution alliances Salesforce. “To date the Salesforce-Deloitte alliance has opened the doors to job seekers through collaboration on programs such as Pathfinder and Deloitte Digital Salesforce Academy providing hundreds of students and career changers access to training mentorship and employment. The Wave program furthers our aligned commitment to a global scale and reach as a purpose-driven and positive force for change.”

Deloitte Digital has already helped participants launch careers in business and technology often in the growing Salesforce ecosystem and will leverage existing programs to enhance Wave offerings. Through this effort Deloitte Digital is focused on skills-based hiring supporting the development of diverse talent and creating more equitable and inclusive workforces.

It will be the largest convention in San Francisco since Covid started though still far smaller than the 170000-person event of pre-pandemic years when the cost of hotel rooms could skyrocket to $2000 a night.

Fittingly Dreamforce–Salesforce’s giant annual conference which starts Tuesday–grew into something of a symbol of the city’s tech makeover shutting down entire city blocks and drawing headliners ranging from Metallica to Barack Obama.

And his company a pioneer of the “software-as-a-service” industry has similarly been a major force in the city helping spur the local tech sector with acquisitions and spin-outs on its way to becoming San Francisco’s largest private employer and a significant philanthropist in its own right.

Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff has long made a show of his love for San Francisco. He put all his super-salesman charm behind his local passions whether it was championing a skyscraper that now dominates the city skyline shaming other billionaires who didn’t support increasing taxes to benefit the homeless or pledging hundreds of millions of his own money to charity including $410 million to UCSF.

The company says the return of Dreamforce shows its commitment to the future of San Francisco and Benioff on Monday is announcing a grant for San Francisco Unified School District following up on a $100 million pledge he made a decade ago.

Since the pandemic began Benioff and his wife Lynne have made $177.7 million in philanthropic contributions to the Bay Area compared to $146.4 million outside the Bay Area according to a Salesforce spokesperson. San Francisco contributions included $15 million to the new Tunnel Tops park and $7 million to restore China Beach.

Investment Highlights

Arabian Drilling is poised to benefit from its strong presence in the Kingdom and from the positive tailwinds in the onshore and offshore drilling market

Primarily operates in the Kingdom which is a leading oil-producing country characterised by the lowest production costs in the world.[9]

The Kingdom is critical in addressing the robust hydrocarbon demand in the MENA region and globally with the Kingdom expected to be the key contributor towards the incremental volume additions in the MENA region with 30% of the total MENA additions until 2030G.9 The Kingdom is expected to increase its hydrocarbon production in onshore and offshore by 2025G at a CAGR of 3% between 2021G and 2025G reaching 13 mmboe/d in 2025G.9

Arabian Drilling has played – and continues to play – a significant and integral role in the growing resilient and changing hydrocarbon production market in the Kingdom with E&P drilling expenditure in the Kingdom expected to increase by 13% per annum from 2021G to 2025G to support increased production. This is underpinned by Saudi Aramco – the Company’s main customer and the main operator of E&P activities in the Kingdom – which announced significant plans to increase relevant annual E&P expenditure to over SAR 150 billion for 2022G compared to SAR 120 billion in 2021G and SAR 101 billion in 2020G (with expenditure expected to grow through to the middle of the decade).

Furthermore the Kingdom is expected to significantly increase natural gas production to cater to the growing gas demand in the Kingdom with the highest demand growth of more than 5% CAGR between 2021G and 2030G compared to a 1.5% increase globally.9

The cost competitiveness of liquids supply in the Kingdom and the Middle East as a whole is expected to result in activity concentration in the region as we move towards 2030G.

All of these factors are expected to drive onshore and offshore rig demand and Arabian Drilling is well positioned to capitalize on the strong market tailwinds.

The Kingdom’s national drilling champion through its specialization in onshore and offshore drilling best-in-class asset base and unique sector and market knowledge

Many years ago I ordered my first hard drive for my original IBM PC. It was a 5.25-inch Seagate ST-225 half-high 20Mbyte hard disk drive (HDD). That’s a capacity of 20 MEGAbytes not GIGAbytes. The ST-225 could barely hold one of today’s shortest compressed video files for YouTube but it represented enormous capacity back then when IBM PC double-sided floppy disks stored only 720Kbytes. Unfortunately that Seagate drive failed after just one or two months. Although such an early failure was somewhat unusual back then reliability was a problem. Hard drives became increasingly reliable over time. They still fail just not as often.

An HDD is essentially a stack of rapidly spinning rust-covered (iron oxide coated) platters made initially of aluminum and then later of glass. (Actually the magnetic coating material these days is cobalt but the phrase “rust-covered” has stuck with me over the decades.) Read/write heads fly perilously close to the surfaces of these platters. The heads are mounted on a swing arm controlled by a servo motor. With two motors and several heads barely separated from a fast-moving surface there’s plenty of room for mechanical failure. And failures do happen catastrophically and without warning.

These days I no longer have PCs with HDDs. Over the past several years Flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) have supplanted HDDs as SSD costs have fallen. SSDs have many advantages over HDDs including faster performance lower operating power and better reliability. The improved reliability is welcome but that does not mean that SSDs don’t fail. They do. However because they’re not mechanical devices and because the wearout mechanisms of Flash memory are so well studied because they’re endowed with wearout-protection mechanisms and because they’re so well instrumented SSDs generally have the good manners to fail on a schedule.

In fact with the right software you can query an SSD and find out exactly where it is in its life cycle. I use a program called CrystalDiskInfo. It gives me a comprehensive report on my SSD’s health. The report on the SSD in my work laptop PC looks like this:

The report tells me that I have a 1Tbyte Crucial MX500 SSD in my laptop and that it thinks it’s in good health with 99% life left in it. As I write this article Amazon sells this SSD for less than $100. That’s much less than I paid for my Seagate ST225 nearly 40 years ago. The statistics in the CrystalDiskInfo report come from the SSD’s S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) data which is generated by firmware that the manufacturer created for and installed in the specific SSD. The CrystalDiskInfo program merely extracts these statistics from the SSD and formats them into a report. (HDDs also generate S.M.A.R.T. data tables.)

The S.M.A.R.T. report shown above looks great. However I buy my laptops as used computers. Take a look at a report from the Intel 1.6Tbyte SSD that was originally installed in another used laptop that I purchased.

This SSD thinks it’s not very healthy. You can tell from the big yellow rectangle labeled “Caution.” The reason that the SSD doesn’t feel healthy appears in the reporting box labeled “Total Host Writes.” That box says that a host wrote 4208322 Gbytes to the drive. That’s more than 4000 Tbytes of data written to a 1.6Tbyte drive which means that on average every Flash memory location on this SSD has been overwritten more than 2600 times. The SSD reports that it’s been powered on for 28156 hours. That’s more than three years of continuous operation yet this SSD has gone through only 32 power cycles since it was manufactured. Even so the SSD seems to be performing very well based on the other statistics in the CrystalDiskInfo report. There are no reallocated sectors no erase failures no CRC errors and no end-to-end errors detected. I take that as a testament to the excellent hardware design and the ruggedness of the Intel SSD’s Flash memory. (Note: Intel completed the sale of its NAND Flash and SSD business to SK Hynix late last year and the assets will move from Intel to SK Hynix over the next few years. Meanwhile SK Hynix is putting the SSD assets from Intel into a new company named Solidigm.)

Nevertheless the SSD itself reports that it thinks it has reached the end of its life. I suspect that warning is based far more on statistical assumptions built into the SSD’s firmware than on the failure indicators which all look excellent. This SSD thinks that it has been written to death and so I replaced it immediately because the replacement cost for the drive is far less than the replacement cost for the data.

Like any electronic subsystem SSDs can fail for many reasons. Electronic components do fail. But the failure mechanism of interest here is the wearout failure that NAND Flash memory experiences after many writes. Flash memory chips can be rated for anywhere between 500 and 100000 writes or more before wearout becomes a problem. That number whatever it is helps to determine the amount of data that you can write to an SSD before wearing out the SSD’s internal Flash memory. In addition the SSD’s temperature over time also affects the wearout rate so that too is accounted for.

SSD vendors employ many error-correction mechanisms to ameliorate the effects of NAND Flash wearout failures. Like HDDs SSDs rely on CRC (cyclic redundancy checking) and ECC (error-correcting codes) to bring down the SSD’s error rates. SSDs employ wear leveling to ensure that write/erase cycles are evenly distributed across the NAND Flash chips in the SSDs and in the individual cells in each NAND Flash chip. If you’re really interested in this topic you can read a paper that my friend Jim Handy (“The Memory Guy”) wrote for SNIA (the Storage Networking Industry Association) nearly ten years ago titled “How Controllers Maximize SSD Life.”

Because of these failure countermeasures SSDs tend to fail gracefully after getting past their initial infant mortality stage. HDDs on the other hand tend to fail suddenly and catastrophically from mechanical failures such as bearing failures and head crashes. However I have to say that the jury is still out on SSD versus HDD reliability because of a recent report from Backblaze a company that runs large data centers. Backblaze published a report in 2021 titled “Are SSDs Really More Reliable Than Hard Drives?” that looked at failure rates for HDDs and SSDs used in its data centers and concluded that SSDs were too new to determine the relative reliability. The report’s final conclusion:

“Given what we know to date using the failure rate as a factor in your decision is questionable. Once we controlled for age and drive days the two drive types were similar and the difference was certainly not enough by itself to justify the extra cost of purchasing an SSD versus an HDD. At this point you are better off deciding based on other factors: cost speed required electricity form factor requirements and so on.”

(Note: Backblaze published an update to this report days before this article appeared. Their new conclusion about SSDs: “At this point we can reasonably claim that SSDs are more reliable than HDDs at least when used as boot drives in our environment. This supports the anecdotal stories and educated guesses made by our readers over the past year or so. Well done.”)

Finally I asked Jim Handy if he’d updated his 2013 SNIA paper. He answered “Thanks for asking but no… The biggest change in all that time is that Data Center admins understand their workloads a lot better than they used to and PC software has eliminated a ton of unnecessary writes. PC software got a lot more SSD-friendly too. For example iOS used to defrag frequently. That made it perform better than Windows but it was very tough on SSD write workloads. I heard that Windows started to notice whether storage was an SSD or HDD and eliminated excessive writes too. All this changed the industry so that high write-load SSDs became less interesting to both applications.”",,,

As a result we began to actively look at other options while balancing life with a newborn. Soon enough I realized that EY has a like-minded leadership globally which values people and passion and began having conversations on what could help my wife and I move to a new continent. One thing led to the other and we both landed in EY Norway in October 2021 (I hear what you're thinking; this isn't the best time to go to Norway!)

We had underestimated the complexity of moving across continents with a child who was only a year and a half old. It took us a lot more time than we expected to ""get settled""—but we managed to work through it thanks to our amazing and supportive colleagues in the US and Norway.

Now that I've been here for almost a year I have been focusing on building EY's capabilities within ServiceNow especially around transformation – be it risk cyber IT/OT HR ESG etc. We were able to successfully deliver our very first ServiceNow implementation in Norway and our very first HR Service Delivery (HRSD) journey in the Nordics early this year.

We have been able to recruit some great talent across the Nordics strengthening our capability across Norway Demark Sweden and Finland while diversifying our focus areas with IT/OT HR Risk Architecture Legal ESG etc. We are still actively growing our team – so if anyone is interested in joining us please ping me 😊. In addition we are also focusing on internal activation sessions trying to leverage the power of EY across its various transformational capabilities—so that we have the skills and the business or sector expertise combined with technology—which is needed for a true transformation.

By exceeding our internal targets for FY22 and a strong base built I am very excited about the future opportunities and truly thankful for the leadership support investment and the great talent we have.

Now that we are settled in it’s time to pick up our travel passion and what better place to start than the beautiful Norwegian landscape.

Software providers aim to cover a wide swath of functionality through in-house product development acquisitions and alliances with other technology companies. Software for MSPs two decades ago initially focused on the remote monitoring and management (RMM) of systems. Since then the scope has grown to include quoting billing project management backup and disaster recovery and cybersecurity. Today the demand for cloud management has opened the door for non-traditional software suppliers to approach MSPs.

The vendors' technology roadmaps are important for services providers which rely on software to run their businesses and support customers. Developments in recent weeks capture the spirit of the changing software times for MSPs:

In platform consolidation MSP software provider Kaseya said it has completed 191 integrations between Kaseya and Datto products and modules since the companies combined. Kaseya based in Miami closed its $6.2 billion purchase of Datto in June 2022. Company officials discussed Datto integration and product strategy last week at DattoCon an annual partner event.

OpsRamp an AIOps provider that offers multi-cloud management continued its push into the MSP market. The San Jose Calif. company last week listed Virtual Service Operations LiquidIT Pinnacle Technology Partners and WinWire as recent customer deployments.

MSP software consolidation: a mixed blessing Mergers and acquisitions involving the largest MSP software players has been among the most visible industry trends. Mega deals such as Kaseya-Datto and smaller add-on transactions such as ConnectWise's Wise-Sync purchase have expanded IT platforms for MSPs. ""MSP software consolidation is having a major impact on the landscape"" said Marty Flaherty executive director at GP Bullhound a technology advisory and investment firm specializing in software. Building out a software platform for MSPs has its advantages. Software customers in general are looking to consolidate the number of vendors they use Flaherty said. ""There are so many tools and they all have their unique capabilities their unique quirks and things you have to get trained on"" he noted adding that maintaining multiple tools becomes expensive. In addition consolidation lets users ""go toward a single pane of glass where you can manage your operations view alerts and manage services"" Flaherty said. MSP software which emerged at the industry's onset is broadening to include options from the cloud management field. Flaherty however also acknowledges that customers may experience uncertainty amid acquisitions. ""There are definitely always concerns about whether or not the acquirer will run the business in the same way whether it's going to focus on a particular end market in the same manner and whether or not they'll invest to keep the products fresh on the on the leading edge"" he said. Kaseya leadership has stated its plan to invest in Datto's products which commits the company to maintaining Datto and Kaseya as dual offerings.

Tool integration as a selling point In general MSP software platform vendors view breadth of capability and expanding integration as benefits for their service provider customers. Holly Pateman senior vice president of product marketing at Kaseya pointed to the company's IT Complete platform as a differentiator noting it provides workflow integration among software modules. IT Complete's modules include RMM PSA security compliance backup and documentation. Pateman distinguished between API integrations and workflow integrations. The latter she said are deeper linkages that provide a more ""seamless experience"" for users. The company is currently implementing workflow integrations between IT Glue (Kaseya's documentation offering) Datto Networking and payment processing systems into Autotask PSA she said. Datto purchased Autotask in 2018. Also in the works are a dozen new supplier integrations and workflow integrations with Datto Commerce a quoting and procurement system for MSPs. MSP software consolidation is having a major impact on the landscape. Marty FlahertyExecutive director GP Bullhound Jake Varghese executive vice president and general manager of business management at ConnectWise said MSPs expect platform providers to offer the key capabilities they use every day -- along with a unified and secure user experience. ConnectWise's Asio platform brings together the company's MSP software portfolio. ""[MSPs] also expect a table-stake set of integrations to be available"" which tightly interweaves the ConnectWise platform with service providers' existing tech stacks he noted. The multiplicity of products and the incremental costs associated with additional management and security surface areas has become a pain point for MSPs Varghese said. ""We hear from a majority of MSPs that they are frustrated by tool sprawl"" he said. While Atera pursues its own set of integrations it also cites IT automations as a feature attracting more MSPs. The company's automations let MSPs create rules and set schedules to execute repeated processes.

Preparation work began Monday as crews get ready to apply a fresh coat of paint to the famed Hollywood Sign.

A crew of 10 workers will apply nearly 400 gallons of paint to the sign over the course of eight weeks. The setup will begin Monday and the project is expected to be completed in November. This year marks the iconic sign’s centennial.

“The sign is the pride of Los Angeles and we are excited for fans all around the world to see this makeover for a very special 100th anniversary” said Jeff Zarrinnam chair of the Hollywood Sign Trust.

Sherwin-Williams which last refurbished the sign in 2012 will run the project again. Duggan and Associates a Los Angeles-based painting company will paint the 45-feet-high sign.

The sign which originally read “Hollywoodland” was shortened to the current “Hollywood” in 1949. It was rebuilt in 1978 and has gone through several repairs.

The entire painting project can be viewed via webcam at: hollywoodsign.org/webcam.

Looking back at investing articles from 2009 and 2020 the worst years for stocks of the Great Recession and the pandemic the fear in the market was palpable. But there were some brave souls with the foresight to look past the headlines -- those who did have been richly rewarded as has been the case in every market correction. Forget timing the bottom; that's a fool's errand. Incrementally buying during those down times was ridiculously profitable.

What's the lesson? Strategize long-term dollar-cost average and stick with fantastic companies. Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) The Trade Desk (TTD -1.59%) Skyworks Solutions (SWKS -0.05%) Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) and Disney (DIS -0.01%) are down more than 20% year to date (YTD) and worthy of hefty consideration.

1. Alphabet looks like a bargain

When a company's primary revenue driver is so popular that it becomes a verb that's a pretty impressive sign. You might have even ""Googled"" to find The Motley Fool. With Alphabet's stock down nearly 23% this year it's time for investors to sit up and take notice.

Alphabet has several profit and growth drivers. Its core Google Search service is a must for advertisers giving it incredible pricing power. YouTube capitalizes on streaming growth and Google Cloud is growing against tough competition.

Google's advertising business which includes Google Search YouTube and Google Network has increased sales from $95 billion to $111 billion year over year through the first half of 2022 against a challenging economic backdrop. Total operating income rose to $39.5 billion from $35.8 billion even as management grappled with inflation and cutbacks in many advertising budgets. Increasing sales in the face of headwinds show the power of Alphabet's market stronghold.

Google Cloud competes with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud market. Sales have grown nearly 40% this year but the segment isn't profitable yet. Google Cloud is a fantastic opportunity for Alphabet to diversify its profit drivers if management can successfully scale to profitability.

Alphabet is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 21 or more than 12% lower than it traded at the start of 2019 making the stock compelling.

2. The Trade Desk capitalizes on a massive shift

While Alphabet has the market cornered in search advertising The Trade Desk is making things happen in streaming. The Trade Desk offers advertisers a comprehensive platform enabling targeted advertising across several mediums including the coveted connected television (CTV) market.

CTV refers to any content accessed through the internet such as watching Netflix or Disney+ on a smart TV or using Roku or similar devices. It's easy to see why this market is the new must-have for advertisers.

The Trade Desk stock is down more than 25% this year after getting caught up in the growth stock euphoria in 2021. But its results are terrific. Revenue reached $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021 marking a 43% increase over the $836 million prior year.

The Trade Desk separates itself from other growth stocks by producing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits to the tune of $138 million in fiscal 2021 along with $379 million in cash from operations -- an impressive 32% margin.

The Trade Desk has momentum opportunity and execution and the stock is now trading near its pre-pandemic price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This could be the time to accumulate shares for the long term.

3. Only one segment matters for Amazon's future

Amazon stock is down 25% this year as investors fret over rising costs logistical headaches and labor shortages which have crushed profits in retail. But Amazon's future is not in online retail sales. Its future is AWS the world's leading cloud services provider and business here is booming. AWS accounts for all of the company's operating income and a significant portion of sales growth this year.

AWS sales reached a record $62.2 billion in 2021 and $72.1 billion over the past 12 months. What's better? AWS has an operating margin of over 30%. Amazon also has a burgeoning digital advertising revenue stream that made $31.2 billion in 2021 and grew 18% last quarter. While some agonize over short-term losses in retail long-term investors can buy the stock at a discount knowing that AWS (with an advertising cherry on top) will power profits for years to come.

4. Skyworks enables our increasingly connected world

Have you been to a big-box store recently and seen these new smart refrigerators? Or maybe you're on the cutting edge and already own one. This is a whimsical example of what's known as the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT includes devices from cars to hearing aids. The future of our world is connected and the semiconductors (chips) made by Skyworks are at the forefront.

Skyworks' chips are also used in conventional applications like smartphones tablets automobiles and gaming platforms. The sluggish demand and expected economic slowdown have caused shares to drop more than 35% year to date. Despite the headwinds the company increased the dividend by 11% last quarter. The forward yield is now close to 2.5% -- historically high for Skyworks. Revenue for third-quarter fiscal 2022 reached $1.2 billion on double-digit growth and management guided for continued growth above 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Chip stocks have been hit hard but incrementally purchasing Skyworks now could pay handsomely in the future. In the meantime investors can enjoy the yield.

5. Don't doubt the mouse

Disney has had a tough few years with the pandemic closing or limiting attendance followed by inflation and fears of a recession. But the company has something up its sleeve: Pricing power. Recent articles show pricing at Disney parks rising much faster than inflation over many years. How can Disney do this? Because it has a unique product that people love and other companies can't replicate.

The stock is down about 28% this year because Wall Street is anticipating that the economy will take its toll on earnings. And they are probably right. But we don't beat the market investing for right now; we outpace the market by anticipating where a company will be in the future.

Disney has several profit drivers for the future. First the parks are a unique experience that has been a rite of passage for generations. Revenue in this segment is up 92% so far this fiscal year reaching $21.3 billion through three quarters. Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services are adding subscribers at a tremendous pace -- 14.4 million were added last quarter alone. In addition the company believes it can capitalize on the sports betting craze with ESPN.

Some investors run for the exits when the market goes on sale. Others use a disciplined strategy to purchase great companies at a discount. If you are in the latter category consider the terrific companies above.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The wife of golfer Dustin Johnson was in attendance Saturday for the latest LIV Golf event which got underway Friday at Rich Harvest Farms in Illinois. The longtime couple who tied the knot earlier this year was photographed together on the back of a cart.

Saturday’s cameo from Gretzky comes two days after her spaced-themed snap on Instagram in which she’s seen modeling a silver bandeau top and a matching miniskirt.

Johnson 38 is seeking his second win with the Saudi-backed league after claiming the top $4 million prize in this month’s Boston outing. Cameron Smith who recently defected to LIV held a lead over Johnson as of Sunday afternoon.

Gretzky the 33-year-old daughter of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky has been supporting Johnson at different LIV events throughout the summer. In fact the couple even shared a kiss on the course after Johnson’s latest victory.

Johnson and Gretzky wed in April nearly nine years after announcing their engagement. The pair celebrated in Tennessee with close friends and family including their two young sons Tatum 7 and River 5.

“4/23/22 What an amazing weekend with friends and family!!!” Johnson wrote on Instagram of the big day.

A short time after the wedding Johnson announced that he was resigning from the PGA Tour in favor of LIV.

“I chose what’s best for me and my family” said Johnson who was reportedly paid around $125 million to make the jump.

Estelle said it all started when he shared his idea about this community development with her.“We wanted to create an opportunity to close the racial wealth gap by providing affordable housing” he said. “So we hired an urban planning firm … [which] worked with stakeholders members of the Oak Cliff community and we came up with this plan.”Most of the housing for this project will be built for long-term homeownership as opposed to rental properties. According to Habitat for Humanity  homeownership provides a foundation for families increases economic stability and can be a catalyst for wealth-building for low-income households.Estelle and Brim see the project as especially important at a time when Dallas is in desperate need of more affordable housing . Throughout the pandemic purchasing a home in Dallas has become costlier and rent costs have continued to spike in recent months. In addition in recent years some areas of southern Dallas have grappled with gentrification Estelle and Brim say their housing plans will help provide southern Dallas residents with a route to owning homes in a way that helps them build more wealth. That's because community members have told them they want affordable homeownership and more equity.“We wanted to have a holistic community and the feedback that we got from the community was basically the same request” Estelle said.As an example of one of the area's hardships Estelle points to the fact that there are too few grocery stores in the neighborhood a fact that has led many to dub parts of southern Dallas a ""food desert."" Estelle said they want to provide an opportunity for businesses to grow in the area and a place where entrepreneurs can have a space they can access to implement their ideas. “We want to have a business incubation-type concept” he said. “Something similar to say like a farmer’s market … where people can come in and for low costs start their businesses [and] set up a location.”The company’s website explains several ways the development will achieve this goal such as by providing health clinics education and cultural centers and boutique hotels.Estelle said that community feedback called for the community to be healthy so planners incorporated green space and walking and bike trails hoping to help create a more livable walkable space.They also wanted to focus on the cultural aspect of the area. Estelle said that one of the advocacy group's board members Akwete Tyehimba who works at the Pan-African Connection Bookstore will help them include that cultural aspect throughout the community.Thus far the Oak Cliff Community Investment Fund has completed several phases of its plan including gathering community feedback and working on concept sketches. Ongoing efforts include additional program and neighborhood research design and development.The team is now raising funds for land acquisition and hopes to begin construction by 2023 with a five-year timeframe for project completion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb2R1Y2VibHVlYm9vay5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOS9vY2Vhbi1taXN0LWZhcm1zLW1ha2VzLWRlYnV0LWF0LXNvdXRoZXJuLWlubm92YXRpb25zLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ocean Mist Farms makes debut at Southern Innovations 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb2R1Y2VibHVlYm9vay5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOS9vY2Vhbi1taXN0LWZhcm1zLW1ha2VzLWRlYnV0LWF0LXNvdXRoZXJuLWlubm92YXRpb25zLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395240BEB0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

“We’re in a situation where… 95% of the capacity in the United States is going to have [a cost that is] a third or higher than ours” Frontier CEO Barry Biffle told FlightGlobal on 15 September.

“I don’t think its been that good since Southwest in the late ’80s” he adds.

Biffle made his comments during an aerospace conference in Washington DC one month after Florida-based ultra-low-cost Spirit walked away from an acquisition proposal from Denver-based Frontier.

Instead Spirit agreed to pursue a competing acquisition offer from New York’s JetBlue an airline with significantly higher operating expenses.

JetBlue reported a cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel expenses of about 10 cents in the second quarter – nearly 40% more than Spirit’s 7.2 cents.

Frontier had intended to use Spirit to create a mega ultra-low-cost carrier. But JetBlue sees in Spirit an opportunity to expand its existing business model.

“That’s going to hurt consumers” Biffle says. “It’s bad for consumers if they have to pay higher prices.”

But Biffle thinks Frontier will end up on top even with JetBlue winning out. That is because he says JetBlue’s plan will eliminate Spirit as a ULCC competitor leaving Frontier with a huge share of ultra-discount segment.

The US airline market essentially has three ULCCs – Allegiant Air Frontier and Spirit which collectively account for about 10% of domestic available seat miles according to Diio data. Of that pie Allegiant holds 15% Frontier has 36% and Spirit has half.

With Spirit out however Allegiant and Frontier would own the ULCC segment themselves. Frontier would have 70% of US domestic ULCC capacity with Allegiant holding the balance data shows.

In that scenario Biffle is correct: 95% of US domestic airline capacity would be controlled by airlines with costs significantly higher than Frontier’s.

JetBlue’s acquisition of Spirit remains far from certain: the carriers must secure regulatory approval from an administration that has taken a strong stance against business deals it views as anti-competitive.

The Department of Justice is already battling in federal court to force JetBlue and American Airlines to abandon their partnership in New York and Boston.

JetBlue anticipates it will clear those hurdles and close its Spirit acquisition by the first half of 2024. JetBlue is to pay $3.6-3.7 billion in cash depending on the close date.

Frontier had offered to buy Spirit with a mix of cash and stock valued at about $2.8 billion. But Frontier insisted its offer stood a greater chance of securing regulatory approval.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZ3VpdGFyLWNlbnRlci1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtc3VycHJpc2UtMjAxNTMxMzExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guitar Center And Southwest Airlines Surprise Passengers With Free Ukulele Lessons While On A Flight To Honolulu,"Imagine getting ukulele lessons while on a flight to Hawaii.

Guitar Center and Southwest Airlines

Guitar Center partnered with Southwest Airlines to host the first-ever in-flight ukulele class.

Passengers learned how to play the ukulele after receiving a Mitchell MU40 Soprano ukulele and a Road Runner carrying case.

The ukulele is one of the most popular instruments in Hawaii. Guitar Center Lessons instructors taught passengers how to play the song “Hello Aloha. How are you?” while en route to Honolulu.

“I’ve taught students through Guitar Center Lessons since 2014 but never in an airplane” says Alexandra Windsor educational affairs specialist for Guitar Center Lessons.

Windsor goes on to share “It was inspiring to see how quickly passengers of all ages picked up the ukulele — many with no musical background. The ukulele is the perfect instrument for beginners and it shows just how fun and easy learning something new can be.”

Brandy King Senior Director of Public Relations at Southwest Airlines says “Our Customers anticipate warm Southwest Hospitality throughout their journeys with us and these Surprise and Delight events are a unique way to create memorable experiences.”

Celebrating Hawaiian culture

“Today’s celebration of Hawaiian culture and Southwest Hospitality underscore our everyday commitment to serve and celebrate the spirit of Aloha” says King.

Southwest is best known for its open seating and two free checked bags but the carrier’s efforts to create memorable experiences for passengers (like rapping flight attendants or special edition Build-a-Bears) have drawn plenty of positive attention. As Brandy King Southwest’s senior director of public relations said in a press statement “surprise and delight events are a unique way to create memorable experiences.” And the chance of being surprised with a one-of-a-kind music lesson or even having a flight attendant telling some stellar jokes is enough for passengers to always fly Southwest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvYXN0cm9uaWNzLWluLXNlYXQtcG93ZXItbmFycm93Ym9kaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astronics expects in-seat power to become ubiquitous on narrowbodies,"In-seat power ports that charge passengers’ gadgets in-flight have a much lower penetration on narrowbody aircraft than on widebody aircraft in today’s world fleet. But Astronics Corporation believes it’s just a matter of time before in-seat power is ubiquitous across single- and twin-aisle types.

“We think sooner or later they’re going to be as common; the installations on narrowbody aircraft are going to be as common as they are on widebody aircraft today” predicted Astronics chairman president and CEO Peter Gundermann during the firm’s 2Q earnings conference call.

He revealed that the cost of nose-to-tail in-seat power on a narrowbody “is typically somewhere in the range of $100000 per ship” or thereabouts. That’s certainly a meaningful investment for any airline to make but passengers increasingly expect to be able to charge an array of devices in-flight.

As such Astronics developed a new architecture for its popular EmPower-branded in-seat power system which will provide 60W Type-C and 10.5W Type-A USB ports at every seat. The ports can power and charge two devices simultaneously including smart phones tablets laptops and other portable electronic devices.

Though Southwest Airlines had long avoided equipping its aircraft with in-seat power it recently became the launch customer for Astronics’ new USB-focused system inking a deal that will see the solution installed on 475 Boeing 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 twinjets as part of the low-cost carrier’s broader $2 billion cabin upgrade initiative to enhance the passenger experience including with faster onboard Internet.

Astronics will begin delivering the shipsets to Southwest in the fourth quarter for retrofit installations on Southwest’s existing MAX 8 fleet which will begin in early 2023. Deliveries to Boeing for installation on new Southwest aircraft on the production line will begin next year.

“So that’s a positive program. It’s only for the MAX fleet at Southwest” said Gundermann in August noting however that: “Southwest also runs a bunch of [737] NGs. And a question you might ask is will they extend this program to those NGs? We think they might as they plan to operate them for a while but as of today it’s only for the MAX aircraft.”

He says the very lightweight nature of the new system is what got Southwest interested and excited. “And we think it’s going to play out positively in other narrowbody operators around the world” added the Astronics CEO.

One might also argue that if an airline offers wireless inflight entertainment and/or live connectivity to passengers with paid tiers there is further impetus for them to offer in-seat power to boot. How else can the full potential of an IFEC program be realized?

Starbucks is adding key features to licensed stores.

Locations in airports and grocery stores will get Starbucks rewards and mobile ordering.

Starbucks rewards members make up about half of all transactions.

Loyal Starbucks customers will finally get all the perks of a standalone Starbucks when they visit licensed stores in Target Kroger and other retailers.

The chain is extending rewards and mobile ordering to licensed stores Chief Marketing Officer Brady Brewer announced at Starbucks Investor Day on September 13 in Seattle. Both rewards and mobile ordering have become key to the business in recent years with accelerated growth during the pandemic Brewer said.

Right now the company offers an ""inconsistent experience"" across locations Brewer said. As a commitment to creating the same experience at all stores Starbucks will extend a program called Starbucks Connect across licensed stores that will bring those benefits.

Starbucks has 7000 licensed stores in North America making up about a third of total stores as of August 2022. About 1400 of them have already adopted Starbucks Connect Brewer said. They made up about 12% of sales in the third quarter with over $900 million in revenue.

Rewards and mobile ordering are both hugely popular among Starbucks customers.

Starbucks has one of the most successful rewards memberships in the fast food business. One in 10 US adults is a Starbucks rewards member Starbucks said. Members receive points for purchases using the chain's app which can be used for free food and drinks and other rewards coming soon. The program has 27.4 million members as of the end of the quarter a year-over-year increase of 13%. Rewards members were responsible for over half of Starbucks' sales last quarter.

Mobile ordering is also big business for Starbucks making up about a quarter of all orders Starbucks said. The service will be available at grocery stores and airport locations once Starbucks Connect goes into effect.

The company did not share when these changes would take place.

Staff Writer

Eight months after voting to become the first unionized Starbucks in Florida the N. Monroe & John Knox store participated in an all-day unfair labor practice strike on Sept. 5 2022. The strike was backed by local activist organizations such as FSU Students for a Democratic Society and the Tallahassee Community Action Committee.

According to the strike letter written by workers at Starbucks and addressed to the store manager and district manager employees went on strike for the following reason: “We strike in solidarity with the NLRB’s complaint against Starbucks where they deemed corporate’s withholding of benefits of unionized stores illegal.” The letter also notes that Starbucks has raised the minimum wage to $15/hr in non-unionized stores three weeks in advance of unionized stores while denying the $15/hr minimum wage to stores known to be in the organizing stages of unionization.

The reason given for the strike is an Aug. 25 2022 complaint filed against Starbucks by the National Labor Relations Board that accuses Starbucks of illegally withholding increased wages and benefits for stores that vote to unionize. The National Labor Relations Board is seeking back pay for denied raises and benefits in addition to interim CEO Howard Schultz reading a notice to all employees informing them that some have been illegally denied raises and benefit increases. The case is scheduled for an Oct. 25 2022 hearing before an administrative law judge.

This comes after a string of complaints leveled against Starbucks by the National Labor Relations Board since a store in Buffalo NY became the first unionized Starbucks in the United States last January. Less than a week before Starbucks was accused of withholding increased pay and benefits from unionized stores a federal judge in Tennessee ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven baristas fired following a union organizing drive at a Starbucks location in Memphis. According to Starbucks Workers United the labor union representing unionized Starbucks workers more than 75 union leaders have been dismissed by the company since December.

Caesar Scalia one of the baristas on strike said that “We all agree the strike was a solid success we had a ton of support from local organizations who showed out for several hours and a large majority of our customers were supportive and sympathetic as well.”

In regards to the ongoing situation between Starbucks and the current trend of unionization Caesar feels it is “disappointing” and that “for a company that constantly prides itself on taking care of its employees it continues to drop the ball the larger our movement grows"".

When asked what he felt being in a union brings to workers Caesar said “I love our union. It’s connected us in ways I thought impossible in a workplace. The solidarity is overwhelming – We proved to ourselves that we got each other’s backs and that we do have a voice that can better our environment here; that was the whole premise of us unionizing – having a voice.”

When asked to comment on the strike Starbucks spokesperson Abigail Barker responded that “Starbucks respects our partners. Partners have a right to lawfully participate in protests or events that are personally important to them. Partners do not represent Starbucks while engaging in protest activity. We remain committed to our partners and will continue to work together side-by-side to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone.”

The N. Monroe & John Knox store was not the only unionized Starbucks that took action on Labor Day. According to an Instagram post from Starbucks Workers United more than 50 other unionized locations participated in pro-labor demonstrations on Sep. 5 2022. Actions from other stores included strikes reduced hours closed cafes and protests. One store in Oklahoma City rallied at the Oklahoma State Capitol joined by local politicians union leaders and the public.

Elsewhere in Tallahassee workers at local business Serenity Coffee and Kava Bar went on strike for Labor Day. According to a statement from Serenity Bartenders United the reasons for their strike included “over two years of mistreatment mismanagement and most importantly abuse that we as employees have received by the hands of our previous manager and owner.”

The Instagram page for Starbucks Workers United Tallahassee asked members of the community to “support a local TLH coffee shop that’s on strike! Workers united will never be divided”. Later in the week Serenity announced its permanent closure citing “rising costs rising rent and heavy inflation.”

A GoFundMe page organized by former Serenity manager Hannah Bancroft disputes Serenity’s reasoning for closure writing that “we used our chance to be the voice for many other small business employees met with the same fate of mismanagement mistreatment and abuse. Yet we were met with the unfortunate fate of the workers losing their lifeline permanently.”

According to data collected from the NLRB as of Sept. 5 2022 more than 200 Starbucks stores across the country have voted to unionize covering over 5500 workers. On April 1 2023 former PepsiCo chief commercial officer Laxman Narasimhan will replace interim CEO Howard Schultz as Starbucks's new chief executive officer. Narasimhan’s position on unionizing Starbucks stores remains unclear at this time.

Looking to the future Caesar hopes “something good will come out of the complaint the NLRB will be taking corporate to court for but as of right now all we can do is keep pushing and hope they’ll meet us and bargain in good faith.”"

The financing from an unnamed lender came upon the completion of a new 250000-square-foot lease signing at the property with private equity firm HarbourVest Partners.

The refinancing proceeds will be used to repay existing debt and provide more than $200 million in capital to bolster the property’s appeal as an in-place working environment. Fortis is planning upgrades geared toward wellness and lifestyle amenities as well as future leasing costs.

""We are reimagining the post-COVID office environment and One Lincoln signifies the beginning of a new era for workplaces in Boston"" Fortis CEO Jonathan Landau said in a statement. ""We both recognized the tremendous demand for luxury office space that is amenitized with unparalleled wellness and lifestyle driven experiences in today's office environment.""

In addition to the loan closing Fortis signed an office lease with HarbourVest Partners establishing it as the new anchor tenant at the building. The Boston-based private equity firm signed a long-term lease for over 250000 square feet of office space spread across 11 floors.

HarbourVest will move its Boston headquarters and all Boston-based employees to One Lincoln. As part of the lease agreement HarbourVest will replace State Street Corp. as the building's namesake.

In early 2019 financial services giant State Street Global Advisors signed a lease for more than half the 1 million-square-foot One Congress office tower currently under construction in Boston.

HarbourVest expects to move into One Lincoln in 2025. The firm has over 650 employees in Boston and over 1000 employees in 12 global offices.

Fortis did not immediately respond to requests for additional information on the financing arrangement.

The $1 billion financing could top the largest deal of the century in Boston. A search of CoStar data turned up only one other deal of similar magnitude.

Much has changed in the Asia-Pacific region’s asset management industry since State Street established its presence in the early 1980s. From China’s financial liberalisation to the internationalisation of Asia’s markets the industry has become unrecognisable. The next 40 years should be equally as transformative with Asia poised to lead the way in new and emerging areas.

Indeed there are several key trends shaping Asian asset management that will have a considerable impact on the industry:

• Larger adoption of ESG principles

• The continued opening up of China as a market

• Emergence of new asset classes and investment strategies

• Globalisation of Asia fund managers.

These structural trends are likely to throw up new opportunities for growth as well as some operational challenges for asset owners and managers alike as the industry adapts to a new investment environment.

Larger adoption of ESG principles

Asset managers and owners worldwide continue to adopt and integrate ESG principles at varying levels. While Europe and the US have led ESG investment over the past decade the trend is now taking hold in APAC.

The region’s asset managers are responding to investor demands by accelerating their adoption of ESG practices with 94% now undertaking some level of ESG integration with many doing so to drive better client outcomes.

But there will be significant ESG challenges for fund managers to navigate in the region.

The absence of a strong pan-regional regulator driving harmonisation like in the EU will likely see investors rather than policymakers become the driving force behind ESG reporting structures and frameworks. This could create uneven reporting of metrics and will most likely be one of the biggest challenges facing the region’s fund managers when using ESG data.

Continued opening up of China

The Chinese market has made significant progress in improving access for international investors over the past decade. Innovations such as the Bond Connect and Stock Connect schemes have allowed offshore investors to get exposure to some of the world’s biggest and most exciting companies.

The process of welcoming international investors has continued providing foreign asset managers with a greater opportunity to expand into the Asian powerhouse. The liberalisation of foreign ownership limits in 2020 could also be a game-changer which can accelerate foreign expansion into China in the coming years.

But in a country where digital platforms are critical in fund distribution and wealth management some asset managers may need to adapt their operations to accommodate local nuances.

Emergence of new asset classes and investment strategies

Investors are seeking out new asset classes and more sophisticated investment strategies and products as the region’s asset management industry matures. For example passive strategies have gained traction in the region with ETFs now a portfolio staple. Meanwhile the search for yield has driven some investors into alternative investments.

Elsewhere growing interest in digital assets is leading to the launch of new strategies that offer early-stage exposure to this exciting asset class.

Globalisation of Asia fund managers

APAC fund managers are also starting to expand outside their domestic markets by adopting new technologies that are transforming cross-border distribution and helping them reach new investors.

Digitisation has allowed the region’s asset managers to leverage data and adapt to rapidly changing investor demand adopt data-driven operating models and innovate with new products. Asset managers can now scale their businesses across the region enter new markets and manage complex portfolios thanks to innovations in areas such as cloud technology artificial intelligence and risk analytics.

Meanwhile greater consolidation creates asset management groups capable of competing with larger peers outside the region.

After four decades of evolution asset managers and owners need a partner that understands the region and can help them seize opportunities quickly while reducing operational and investment risks.

A new Georgia program aims to improve birth outcomes,"Atlanta-basesd doula Chanel Stryker-Boykin right works with a client who began laboring at a Black Maternal Health Walk in 2022 at the Motherhouse in Atlanta's West End. Stryker-Boykin is one of the doulas participating in a new pilot program from Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia to explore how Medicaid might cover doula services for lower income pregnant people. (Submitted) (Special to Reckon News)

Could a state like Georgia improve birth outcomes through doula support – and could Medicaid pay for it?

Leaders at one Atlanta-based nonprofit want to find out.

Earlier this year the Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia launched a pilot program to provide a doula – a non-medical professional trained to provide support during pregnancy birth and afterward – to 175 pregnant Medicaid recipients across Georgia.

“We think of doulas as being present for a birth and assume that’s all a doula does” said Precious Andrews director of special projects at Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia. “But they do so much more. They can be the taxi driver to appointments the babysitter when mom has more than one child. They can be an educator for mom and a breastfeeding supporter.

“The scope of what they can do is just so wide.”

The goal of the pilot program is to demonstrate how doula care might impact pregnancy outcomes for low-income families and how Medicaid – the government-sponsored health insurance for low-income people – could cover the cost. In Georgia Medicaid covers nearly half of all births.

The pilot is funded through grants from care management organizations that contract with Georgia Medicaid. And while Medicaid itself is not directly involved with the pilot program the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services have issued federal policy guidance saying that doula support is associated with improved health outcomes including decreased likelihood of postpartum depression and near-universal breastfeeding among people who have lower incomes.

“Regardless of how you give birth I think everyone who wants to have a doula deserves to have a doula” said Chanel Stryker-Boykin a doula in metro Atlanta who is participating in the pilot program.

“For people who may not normally have access to a doula we’re providing that access barrier-free.”

A sustainable model?

Back in May the program enrolled pregnant Medicaid recipients and assigned them certified doulas to support them throughout their pregnancy birth and the postpartum period (the weeks following a birth). Participants also get access to prenatal classes peer support groups and a care package.

The program pays for two prenatal doula visits labor and delivery care and two postpartum doula visits. Doulas receive $50 per visit and $550 for attending labor and delivery.

It’s a dual effort said Andrews: to make doulas accessible to families who might not otherwise be able to afford their services and to compensate doulas fairly.

“Most of us do this as a calling” said Stryker-Boykin. “But everyone deserves to be paid for their work. If we’re saying doulas are such a benefit to maternal health outcomes and can shift birth experiences to be more positive then we have to recognize they are valuable and deserve to be paid to keep this model sustainable.”

Andrews said the program is also meant to serve as a model for how Georgia Medicaid could cover doula care – from the doula reimbursement structure to the potential improvement in birth outcomes.

Across the South as in Georgia Medicaid covers nearly half of all births. Among Black Georgians Medicaid covers two-thirds of births.

And Georgia like its Southern neighbors has poor birth outcomes compared with national averages. It’s got one of the nation’s highest maternal mortality rates and ranks among the 10 states with the highest rates of babies born early and underweight.

Rates are worse for Black mothers and babies. Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications compared to white women and Black babies are twice as likely to die in infancy as white babies.

“If you’re giving birth anywhere in this country especially if you’re a Black-identifying person you need childbirth education and adequate postpartum support. You deserve it” said Stryker-Boykin.

‘Godsend’

Andrews experienced a health emergency after the birth of her daughter. She hired a postpartum doula who helped her breastfeed and reminded her to take her medication babysat her toddler and helped clean the house.

Andrews calls her a “godsend.”

“We get so caught up in making sure mom and baby deliver safely but mom and baby still need help after all of that is said and done” said Andrews. “Once the ‘new car smell’ is gone people are not checking on you or helping as much but that doula is there to say ‘What do you need? This is what I can do for you.’”

There’s still widespread misunderstanding of the role that doulas can play in a pregnant person’s healthcare she said and a lack of awareness among potential clients – especially those outside urban areas.

To increase doula access across Georgia particularly in rural and underserved areas the coalition also has a scholarship program that recruits and trains doulas certified breastfeeding specialists childbirth educators and certified maternal mental health peer support specialists. Some of the doulas who came through their training like Stryker-Boykin are now working with pregnant mothers in the Medicaid pilot.

“Our maternal health system in Georgia is challenging to navigate” said Stryker-Boykin. “But it’s also beautiful to see so many birth givers recognizing the power they hold. With that power comes the need to be informed and to make decisions about their birth experiences. It’s powerful and beautiful to be a part of that.”

‘These are our people’

Andrews said research supports the positive impact doulas can have on birth givers and on states’ bottom lines.

A study published in the journal Birth in 2016 found that women who received doula support had lower preterm and cesarean birth rates compared to all Medicaid recipients. The study also found that coverage of doula support could save state Medicaid programs nearly $1000 per beneficiary. Another study found that access to doula services for low-income pregnant people could improve birth-related outcomes for people of color in underserved communities.

About a dozen states currently reimburse for doula services through Medicaid or are in the process of doing so. Another five including Georgia are considering a Medicaid doula program according to the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families.

Doula pilot programs in other states have resulted in Medicaid coverage. Florida’s Medicaid program began covering doula services in 2018 for some of its recipients. In the wake of doula pilot programs in California that state’s Medicaid program announced it will add doula services to its coverage beginning January 2023. In its announcement California’s health department said it based its doula reimbursement rates in part on doula pilot programs that were operated by managed care plans in California – similar to the format that Georgia’s pilot program is following.

Andrews said the data gathered through Georgia’s pilot will be presented to state legislators next year.

“You can’t always think a legislator wants to see something from Florida or California; they need to see there’s a demand in a state where they work” said Andrews. “These are Georgia residents. These are our people and there’s a demand for doulas to be paid through Medicaid – now what are you going to do about it?”",,,,,,

Over the last five years we’ve increased our efforts with the government and aerospace sectors via program support at Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) as well as at traditional and non-traditional defense prime contractors.

In 2021 Synopsys acquired FirstPass Engineering to better support the U.S. defense industry and DoD Trusted Designs. Through our FirstPass Engineering subsidiary Synopsys is now a DoD Trusted Foundry Program Accredited Supplier. This capability can positively impact U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing the related supply chain and national security. Read on to learn more about the significance of being a DoD Trusted Supplier.

DoD trusted suppliers: Fostering greater chip supply chain security

The U.S. government needs access to advanced microelectronics that can operate reliably under what are often extremely harsh conditions from desert to sea to space. However given the sensitivity of some of its end applications—systems like satellites rockets and missiles—the integrity and security of these SoCs is critical. Outsourced design and manufacturing leave the country vulnerable against security threats like hardware trojans back doors overbuilding and counterfeiting and to supply chain disruptions triggered by conflicts natural disasters or pandemics.

The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) acts as the program manager for the DoD Trusted Foundry program which is aimed toward cost-effectively assuring the confidentiality and integrity of SoCs during their design and manufacturing. The program encompasses the people and processes used to create and distribute microelectronics. According to the DMEA trusted sources in this program will take measures such as safeguarding against IC tampering protecting against reverse engineering and supply disruptions and providing an assured “chain of custody” for classified and unclassified SoCs.

Through the acquisition of FirstPass Engineering in 2021 Synopsys strengthened our investment in aerospace and defense technologies supporting the U.S. government as a DMEA-accredited and trusted supplier to the DoD. Synopsys provides system design solutions with secure capabilities to address:

Post-silicon analysis to verify design integrity and detect intrusions

Defense against side-channel attacks device tampering bootloader corruption and reverse engineering

Tooling and design flow solutions

Lab services

A trusted design flow with radiation-tolerant (RT) technology represents a key combination needed to create DoD trusted designs. These skills are becoming more important as the U.S. builds capabilities for defense in space with entities like the United States Space Force.

An assured microelectronics approach requires secure tools IP software integrity and services. Our comprehensive synthesis debugging and verification solutions for SoC and FPGA-based designs enable aerospace and defense companies to deliver innovative products faster and cheaper while also meeting higher standards needed for fault-tolerant designs. For example our tools can support device-level radiation modeling as well as beneficial code insertions to improve radiation and attack resistance.

Trusted collaboration moves innovation forward

As a longtime collaborator with the U.S. government and defense industry leaders Synopsys has a front-row seat to the challenges and opportunities that the semiconductor industry has in aerospace and defense. We understand the exacting security safety longevity and reliability demands of silicon software photonics and optics for mission-critical aerospace and defense applications. Our involvement spans many fronts including:

Summary

Semiconductors have become an essential building block for modern society. Assured supply chains are needed not only for government aerospace and defense but also critical systems in finance automotive industrial and medical. Government investment along with trusted partners like Synopsys address national security and supply chain concerns.

Julio Delgado Wants to Change That.,"American Red Cross chief investment strategist Julio Delgado wants to shake up how asset allocators — and managers — do business.

“A lot of pension plans and endowments are being charged too much money which is staying in the hands of the intermediaries [better known as] the ‘middle guys’” Delgado said in a recent interview.

So he’s been building a portfolio management style all his own. Delgado prefers to avoid using investment managers when he can so he doesn’t get bogged down in the selection process. Instead he focuses the staff primarily on risk management and introducing derivatives into the portfolio. “It’s not know-who” Delgado said. “It’s know-how.”

As one of his fellow allocators explained the Red Cross “does a lot of risk derivative overlays. Much more than almost anyone else.”

Delgado’s roots are in asset management. He ran an emerging markets bond fund at T. Rowe Price for nearly six years giving him the confidence to run investments himself and having the Red Cross pocket the savings.

“I used to work on the buy side” he said. “I never understood why a lot of these massive endowments and pension plans didn’t do more things themselves. I’ve been thinking [about this whole process] for years.”

Delgado joined the Red Cross’s investment team in 2005 and he’s seen the organization through several big changes. In 2017 two and a half years after hiring Greg Williamson as its CIO the Red Cross decided to outsource its investment process hiring Cambridge Associates to head up the effort.

In 2020 the board reversed course moving back to in-house management with Delgado at the helm of a four-person team. But the fund didn’t insource everything.

“We decided to outsource truly everything except investing” Delgado said. “We outsourced manager due diligence reporting execution and product/strategy development. Our focus is on asset allocation and fully understanding the risks that we own.”

Today the Red Cross has three portfolios: a $1.5 billion pension a $1.2 billion endowment and some additional capital that hovers between $200 and $300 million. The strategy relies heavily on managing risk using a process that considers how investments perform in both growth and inflation scenarios.

The focus on inflation has been rewarding for the portfolio: “When things started getting bad we made money” Delgado said. “We weren’t focused on reducing losses but on generating gains.”

Delgado defines each asset class as either “core” or “completion.” The “core functionality” includes alternative investment managers and is relatively illiquid. The completion portfolio is then used to manage the Red Cross’s overall risk with cash and derivatives.

To evaluate investments the Red Cross team uses a three-by-three grid that includes scenarios of low medium and high inflation and low medium and high growth. By comparing those environments they’re able to evaluate the possible risks in each situation — and find ways to manage them.

Delgado’s team uses what they describe as “extremely cheap” derivatives in the completion portfolio to adjust both upside and downside risk. Rather than hiring managers to handle those derivatives Delgado manages them in-house. His team also takes big positions ensuring that the bid/ask spread of the options is cheap.

Delgado summed up his strategy like this: It’s liquid transparent cheap and efficient.

“You need to be liquid to change things” he said. “You need to be transparent because you need to know what risks you have. It also has to be cheap. The cheapest thing you can buy will allow you to keep most of the returns. The [final] thing you need is capital efficiency. Capital efficiency means that a portion of your portfolio can be used as leverage to reduce risk. You need cash to be able to do that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20ucG9yc2NoZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi9jb21wYW55L3BvcnNjaGUtYWctaW5pdGlhbC1wdWJsaWMtb2ZmZXJpbmctcHVibGljYXRpb24tcHJvc3BlY3R1cy1vZmZlci1wZXJpb2QtMjk3NDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prospectus for IPO of Porsche AG published,"The Dr. Ing. h.c.

To cover potential over-allotments the Selling Shareholder has agreed to make available a specified number of Preferred Shares to the Underwriters. In addition the Selling Shareholder has granted the Underwriters an option to acquire a number of Preferred Shares equal to the number of Preferred Shares allotted to cover over-allotments during the Stabilisation Period (as defined below). In connection with the placement of Preferred Shares BofA Securities Europe SA will act as the stabilisation manager and may as stabilisation manager make over-allotments and take stabilisation measures in accordance with legal requirements (Art. 5(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 in conjunction with Articles 5 through 8 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052) to support the market price of the Preferred Shares and thereby counteract any selling pressure. The stabilisation manager is under no obligation to take any stabilisation measures. Therefore stabilisation may not necessarily occur and may cease at any time. Such measures may be taken on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) from the date when trading in the Preferred Shares is commenced on the regulated market segment (regulierter Markt) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) expected on or around 29 September 2022 and must be terminated no later than 30 calendar days after this date (the “Stabilisation Period”).

At that level Porsche — maker of the 911 sports car and the Taycan electric sedan — would be valued at a higher level than German rivals like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

The offering of Porsche on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange months in the making comes as volatile stock markets have chilled interest in initial public offerings. If the stock sale is completed Porsche’s public offering will be one of the largest ever in Europe according to Refinitiv.

It would return Porsche to the public markets for the first time in a decade after Volkswagen bought the sports car maker following a failed effort by Porsche to buy the much larger Volkswagen.

Shares of Take-Two Interactive Software tumbled 3% on Monday after a hacker leaked hours of early development footage of its highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 game over the weekend.

More than 90 gameplay videos of the game were posted to an online Grand Theft Auto forum on Saturday night by a hacker that used the screen name ""teapotuberhacker."" The hacker has since claimed that they could leak more data soon from the game including its source code.

And according to The Verge the hacker has also taken credit for a cyberattack against Uber last week. That claim has not been verified.

While the leak set the internet on fire over the weekend it also created a big headache at Take-Two and its subsidiary Rockstar Games.

The headaches stem from the fact that the leak is likely to disrupt the development of the game in the short-term and could ultimately lead to a delayed release as Rockstar assesses if any of its source code was compromised during the hack.

Jefferies analysts said the hack is ""a PR disaster possibly sets back production and hurts morale"" at the company. For one the hack could lead to a change to Take-Two's work-from-home policy in a bid to tighten up security on its game development.

Research firm MoffettNathanson said in a note seen by Bloomberg that while ""the footage alone wouldn't do much to harm the commercial prospects of the game"" the hack could ""force a large amount of rework and in the process slow production down considerably.""

But Take-Two says development of the game will continue on as planned. In an 8-K filed with the SEC on Monday Take-Two said:

""Rockstar Games recently experienced a network intrusion in which an unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from its systems including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto. Current Rockstar Games services are unaffected. We have already taken steps to isolate and contain this incident. Work on the game will continue as planned. At this time Rockstar Games does not anticipate any disruption to its current services nor any long-term effect on its development timelines as a result of this incident.""

It was just a few months ago Take-Two Interactive Software confirmed that a sequel to the second-best selling video game of all time was in the works. And while no release date timeframe was revealed by Take-Two the game is still likely years away from being released.

Grand Theft Auto 6 is a a follow up to Grand Theft Auto 5 which was released nearly a decade ago in 2013. Grand Theft Auto 5 has sold more than 160 million copies and has seen renewed life via its online gaming mode.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2d0YS12aS1sZWFrZWQtdHJhZGluZy10YWtlLXR3by1zdG9jay1vbi1kaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trading Take-Two Stock on Dip After Grand Theft Auto VI Leak,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/gta-vi-leaked-trading-take-two-stock-on-dip on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2d0YS12aS1sZWFrZWQtdHJhZGluZy10YWtlLXR3by1zdG9jay1vbi1kaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtyZWFkaW5nLmNvbS9jeWJlcmF0dGFja3MtZGF0YS1icmVhY2hlcy9yb2Nrc3Rhci1nYW1lcy1jb25maXJtcy1ncmFuZC10aGVmdC1hdXRvLTYtYnJlYWNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockstar Games Confirms 'Grand Theft Auto 6' Breach,"Rockstar Games a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software today confirmed that an unauthorized third party had downloaded files and videos for its flagship game Grand Theft Auto 6 following the posting over the weekend of scores of video clips to an online forum.

More than 90 video files — since removed — were posted at 3:26 a.m. on Sunday Sept. 18 to the GTAForums. Several forum users considered the videos to be authentic and the forum administrators appeared to confirm that that data was stolen when they pulled down the files and posted a warning for forum members to not share media or links to copyrighted material.

By early Monday Take-Two Interactive had confirmed the breach in a corporate filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""Rockstar Games recently experienced a network intrusion in which an unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from its systems including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto"" the company stated in the filing. ""Current Rockstar Games services are unaffected. We have already taken steps to isolate and contain this incident.""

The breach is the latest attack on gaming companies. In June 2021 game giant Electronic Arts suffered a massive breach with cybercriminals stealing nearly 800GB of source code and data from the firm. The breach followed an attack on CD Projekt Red the maker of the Witcher games and Cyberpunk 2077 which resulted in the theft of internal data and source code.

Game companies are not the only group being targeted — attackers are also focused on gamers. Players of the top 28 games encountered more than 380000 instances of malware and unwanted files the 12 months ending in June 2022 according to software security firm Kaspersky Lab. Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto was the fourth most targeted PC game according to the firm's analysis.

""Despite the fact that the number of users affected by gaming-related threats has dropped certain gaming threats are still on the rise"" Kaspersky researchers stated. ""Over the past year we have seen an increase in cybercriminal activity around stealers which allow attackers to steal bank card data credentials and even crypto wallets data from infected devices.""

Uber-Hacker Poser

In the Rockstar Games attack the threat actor apparently gained access through a compromised credential. The cybercriminal used the name ""teapotuberhacker"" reportedly claiming to be the person behind the breach of Uber last week.

However reliable details of the hack are in short supply. Already fraudsters have posted a great deal of misinformation on Twitter and have reserved names similar to the hacker's on Telegram and other social media networks.

A thread on the GTAForums appears to be genuine however. The administrators have already removed the video files and links posted by the purported hacker. Multiple posts on the GTAForums have claimed that the videos came from a developer Slack channel which is similar to the compromise of Electronic Arts. The posted videos are dated between March 2021 and September 2022.

Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games played down the impact of the attack maintaining that the development of the game will not be affected.

""Work on the game will continue as planned"" the company stated in its SEC filing. ""At this time Rockstar Games does not anticipate any disruption to its current services nor any long-term effect on its development timelines as a result of this incident.""

The hacker posted the videos to GTAForums early Sunday morning stating ""Here are 90 footage/clips from GTA 6"" and adding ""Its possible i could leak more data soon GTA 5 and 6 source code and assets GTA 6 testing build.""

The attacker may not have had general access to Rockstar Games' systems but only the communication channels used by developers. ""These videos were downloaded from Slack"" the poster wrote clarifying that the source was ""employee communications.""

Wall Street Fallout

The breach initially hurt Take-Two Interactive's stock price (NASDAQ: TTWO) but the company's assurance that the game's launch date would not be delayed seemed to assuage investors and the stock rose slightly by late afternoon. The company has actually not yet announced the game's official release data but reports have pegged mid- to late-2024 as likely.

""We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way"" the company said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you our players that truly exceeds your expectations.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS93aGF0LWlzLWdvaW5nLW9uLXdpdGgtdGFrZS10d28tdHR3by1zdG9jay10b2RheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Going on With Take-Two (TTWO) Stock Today?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tdmktbGVhay1hbmQtaGFja2VyLXJvY2tzdGFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Theft Auto VI footage leaks and hacker threatens to spill more,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.axios.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/18/grand-theft-auto-vi-leak-and-hacker-rockstar (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239504E0AF0>, 'Connection to www.axios.com timed out.

There are four ETFs in Invesco’s lineup of equal weight S&P 500 strategies that have taken in over $100 million in year-to-date inflows as of September 16 including the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight ETF (RSP) the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Utilities ETF (RYU) the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF (RHS) and the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Energy ETF (RYE)

RSP has taken in $3.3 billion in net inflows year to date which is more than any other fund in Invesco’s ETF range according to VettaFi.

RSP is based on the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index and Invesco ESG S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSPE) is based on the S&P 500 Equal Weight ESG Leaders Select Index. RSPE’s underlying index is designed to measure the equal-weighted performance of securities included in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index that also meet ESG criteria while maintaining similar overall industry group weights as the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index according to the firm.

RYU has taken in $224 million in year-to-date inflows. RYU offers exposure to equities included in the S&P 500 Utilities Index which covers the following industries: electric utilities gas utilities multi-utilities and unregulated power and water utilities telecommunication service companies including fixed-line cellular wireless high bandwidth and fiber-optic cable networks.

RHS has seen $196 million in net inflows year to date. The fund offers exposure to the consumer staples sector of the U.S. economy but with a unique twist: the fund tracks an equal-weighted index meaning that component companies receive approximately equal allocations. That results in exposure that is considerably more balanced than other alternatives.

RYE has accreted $119 million in year-to-date inflows. The fund tracks an index that equally weights stocks in the energy sector of the S&P 500 Index. RYE has 23 equally weighted holdings with the top 10 holdings amounting to 49.10% of the fund as of September 15. Holdings include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) Targa Resources Corp (TRGP) ConocoPhillips (COP) Hess Corporation (HES) and ONEOK Inc (OKE).

An equal weighting methodology may be particularly appealing in the top-heavy energy industry where traditional cap weighting can result in significant concentration issues.

LOUIS — Christina Green hoped cataract surgery would clear up her cloudy vision which had worsened after she took a drug to fight her breast cancer.

This story also ran on Fortune. It can be republished for free.

But the former English professor said her 2019 surgery with Ophthalmology Consultants didn’t get her to 20/20 vision or fix her astigmatism — despite a $3000 out-of-pocket charge for the astigmatism surgical upgrade. Green 69 said she ended up feeling more like a dollar sign to the practice than a patient.

“You’re a cow among a herd as you just move from this station to this station to this station” she said.

Ophthalmology Consultants is part of EyeCare Partners one of the largest private equity-backed U.S. eye care groups. It is headquartered in St. Louis and counts some 300 ophthalmologists and 700 optometrists in its networks across 19 states. The group declined to comment.

Switzerland-based Partners Group bought EyeCare Partners in 2019 for $2.2 billion. Another eye care giant Texas-based Retina Consultants of America was formed in 2020 with a $350 million investment from Massachusetts-based Webster Equity Partners a private equity firm and now it says on its website it has 190 physicians across 18 states. Other private equity groups are building regional footprints with practices such as Midwest Vision Partners and EyeSouth Partners. Acquisitions have escalated so much that private equity firms now are routinely selling practices to one another.

In the past decade private equity groups have gone from taking over a handful of practices to working with as many as 8% of the nation’s ophthalmologists said Dr. Robert E. Wiggins Jr. president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

They are scooping up eye care physician practices nationwide as money-making opportunities grow in medical eye care with the aging of the U.S. population. Private equity groups backed by wealthy investors buy up these practices — or unify them under franchise-like agreements — with the hopes of raising profit margins by cutting administrative costs or changing business strategies. They often then resell the practices at a higher price to the next bidder.

The profit potential for private equity investors is clear: Much like paying to upgrade plane seats to first class patients can choose expensive add-ons for many eye procedures such as cataract surgery. For example doctors can use lasers instead of cutting eye lenses manually offer multifocal eye lenses that can eliminate the need for glasses or recommend the astigmatism fix that Green said she was sold. Often patients pay out-of-pocket for those extras — a health care payday unconstrained by insurance reimbursement negotiations. And such services can take place in outpatient and stand-alone surgery centers both of which can be more profitable than in a hospital setting.

The investments that private equity groups provide can help doctors market and expand their practices as well as negotiate better prices for drugs and supplies Wiggins said. But he warned that private equity companies’ quest to maximize profitability runs the risk of compromising patient care.

“The problems are accumulating and driving up prices” added Aditi Sen director of research and policy at the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute which provides data and analysis about the economics of health care.

Yashaswini Singh a health economist at Johns Hopkins University and her colleagues analyzed private equity acquisitions in ophthalmology gastroenterology and dermatology and found that practices charged insurance an extra 20% or an average of $71 more after the acquisition. Private equity-owned practices also saw a substantial rise in new patients and more frequent returns by old patients according to their research published Sept. 2 in the JAMA medical journal.

A KHN analysis also found that private equity firms are investing in the offices of doctors who prescribe at high rates two of the most common macular degeneration eye drugs meaning the doctors are likely seeing high volumes of patients and thus are more profitable.

KHN analyzed the top 30 prescribers of the macular degeneration eye drugs Avastin and Lucentis in 2019 through a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database. Private equity companies went on to invest in 23% of the top Avastin prescribers and 43% of the top Lucentis prescribers — far higher than the 8% of ophthalmologists in which private equity currently holds a stake. Retina Consultants of America for example has invested in the practices of four of the top Avastin prescribers and nine of the top Lucentis prescribers.

“The private equity model is a model that focuses on profitability and we know they are not selecting practices randomly” Sen said.

She noted that the volume of patients would be attractive to private equity as well as the idea of investing in practices utilizing expensive Lucentis prescriptions which cost roughly $1300 an injection. Furthermore she said after being acquired by private equity doctors could potentially change their prescription habits from the cheaper Avastin that costs about $40 to Lucentis – improving the bottom line.

Retina Consultants of America did not respond to requests for comment.

Last summer Craig Johnson then 74 decided it was finally time to have cataract surgery to fix his deteriorating eyes. He decided to go to CVP Physicians in Cincinnati calling it “the cream of the crop locally for having eye surgery” as they do “100 a day.” The practice was already part of a private equity investment but has since been acquired by another investor behemoth EyeCare Partners for $600 million.

Johnson while happy with the results of his surgery did not know about the manual cutting version of the surgery — the cheaper but just as effective alternative to using a laser. Johnson was using private insurance because he was still working and he said that resulted in over $2000 out-of-pocket charges for each eye. Laser surgery typically costs more than manual and may not be covered by insurance plans according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Johnson explained that a salesperson as well as a physician walked him through options to improve his eyesight.

“Seniors are a vulnerable population because they’re on a fixed income they’re a little older they trust you … you’re wearing a white coat” said Dr. Arvind Saini an ophthalmologist who runs an independent practice in California’s San Diego County.

Many patients have no idea whether private equity investors have a stake in the practices they choose because they are often referred to them by another doctor or are having an eye emergency.

David Zielenziger 70 felt lucky to get a quick appointment at one of Vitreoretinal Consultants of NY’s practices after his retina detached. Zielenziger a former business journalist didn’t know it was associated with Retina Consultants of America. He loved his doctor and had no complaints about the emergency care he received — and continued to go there for follow-ups. Medicare covered just about everything he said.

“It’s a very busy practice” he said noting that it has expanded to more locations which must be making the investors happy.

In 2018 Michael Kroin co-founded Physician Growth Partners a group that helps doctors sell their practices to private equity firms to capitalize on the explosion of interest. Eye care is one of the largest areas of investment he said because the specialty health care services apply to such a broad market of people.

Sixteen of the 25 private equity firms identified by industry tracker PitchBook as the biggest health care investors have bought stakes in optometry and ophthalmology practices a KHN analysis found.

Kroin expects private equity investment in practices will only continue to accelerate because of competition from the “1000-pound gorilla” of hospitals that also are acquiring practices and as the bureaucracy of insurance reimbursement forces more physicians to seek outside help. “If you’re not growing it’s going to be tough to survive and make a similar level of income as you had historically” he said.

Some health care experts worry that private equity companies could eventually be left holding an overly leveraged bag if other firms don’t want to buy the practices they’ve invested in which could lead to the closures of those practices and ultimately even more consolidation.

“I’m not sure that most physician practices are so inefficient that you can get 20% more profit out of them” said Dr. Lawrence Peter Casalino chief of the division of health policy and economics at Weill Cornell Medicine’s Department of Population Health Sciences. And he said investors count on reselling to a buyer who will pay more than what they paid. “If that doesn’t work the whole thing unravels.”

For example when Publix began to use a steadier pallet to stack product in its Lakeland dairy plant the company found that it no longer needed the cardboard slip sheets it used to protect the ice cream. That change saves nearly 1 million square feet of cardboard each year according to Publix.

In another innovative shipping move Publix’s neighbor up north Rochester N.Y.-based Wegmans has started using newly designed RPCs (returnable plastic containers) to get fresh seafood from suppliers to its stores eliminating the need for Styrofoam coolers. Wegmans claims to be the first retailer to launch such a program for seafood. It worked with Atlanta-based Tosca to get the smaller crates that would be suitable for the seafood team’s needs.

Another way that more grocers are cutting down on plastic and other in-store waste is through their store-brand packaging.

UPM Raflatac a supplier of label materials with global headquarters in Helsinki is seeing an uptick in interest from retailers in regard to recycling. Brinder Gill sales director at the company notes “We work with numerous retailers and packaging suppliers on initiatives for packaging redesign for their in-house brands to enable recyclability where labels play an important role.”

Most of the retailers that are prioritizing sustainability have set a goal of having all of their store-brand packaging be reusable recyclable or compostable by 2025.

Aldi has already reduced its use of plastic and increased the recyclability of its packaging so that 62% of its Aldi-exclusive packaging is now reusable recyclable or compostable. In the produce department the company has removed 1 million trays from its asparagus packaging and is currently testing a reduced-plastic packaging format for produce items. Aldi also managed to remove 37 tons of material by transitioning its product labels to more sustainable alternatives.

Aldi’s Kavanaugh notes that the company has “a lot of leverage when it comes to the packaging of products sold on Aldi’s shelves” since more than 90% of its products are Aldi exclusives. “We can implement changes quickly and efficiently throughout our product mix” she says.

Cincinnati-based Kroger for its part has taken a fresh approach to packaging with a reusable alternative. Last year it became the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop from Trenton N.J.-based TerraCycle and started bringing popular brands in reusable packaging to customers in a pilot during its third quarter. The program has now expanded to more than 20 stores.

Target meanwhile launched an initiative called Target Zero earlier this year which empowers guests to easily shop for products with packaging designed to be refillable reusable or compostable or made with recycled content or plastic alternatives. By 2025 Target expects to offer two circular own brands and by 2040 it plans for 100% of its own brands to “be designed for a circular future.”

In the online retailing space Frustration-Free Packaging is Amazon’s flagship program offering more sustainable packaging that’s easy to open fully recyclable and capable of shipping without additional packaging protection. By the end of 2021 more than 2 million products qualified and Amazon estimated that this packaging change avoided 30000-plus tons of plastic across North America in 2021.

One other major trend in own-brand packaging is that more retailers are adding communications — namely the How2Recycle logo from the Charlottesville Va.-based Sustainable Packaging Coalition — to remind their shoppers to recycle.

By the end of this year Albertsons’ and Walmart’s own-brand packaging will feature the How2Recycle label on 100% of their U.S. private-brand food and consumable products.

Aldi which has completed the addition of the How2Recycle logo on all of its Aldi-exclusive food and nonfood everyday items also offers its shoppers sustainable “Aldi Finds” including reusable straws and reusable sandwich/snack bags.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy84LWhpZ2hlc3QteWllbGRpbmctZXF1aXR5LXJlaXRzLTE0MDUwMzU3My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Of The Highest Yielding Equity REITs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy84LWhpZ2hlc3QteWllbGRpbmctZXF1aXR5LXJlaXRzLTE0MDUwMzU3My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FFC75B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said a “race to the bottom” on the headline tax rate on company profits had failed to boost investment and economic growth in Britain over the past 15 years.

Liz Truss the prime minister and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng argue that lower rates of corporation tax could unleash an investment boom in Britain to help drive up economic growth towards a target rate of 2.5% a year. Kwarteng will confirm more detail around the tax cuts on Friday at a planned “fiscal event” or mini-budget.

However the IPPR said slashing the headline rate from 30% in 2007 to 19% in 2019 orchestrated by the former chancellor George Osborne did not spur higher private investment or faster economic growth.

Despite the repeated tax cuts to the lowest rate in a century the UK fell behind Italy and Canada to rank with the lowest private sector investment in the G7 as a share of national income.

The following year the UK ranked 28th for business investment out of 31 members of a wider group of developed countries in the OECD.

Studies have shown corporation tax cuts used by successive Conservative governments have had little bearing on business investment and economic growth undermining the argument of free-market Tories that such tax breaks pay for themselves.

Cuts to corporation tax came with a net cost to the exchequer of almost £73bn between 2010 and 2018 according to research by the Social Market Foundation. In only one year did an increase in business investment outweigh the cost.

Business investment has flatlined in recent years amid concern over Brexit then Covid and a challenging economic outlook. Official figures show the level of investment remains 5.7% below where it was before the pandemic while economists warn rising energy costs and sky-high inflation will put a dampener on spending.

Governments around the world have committed last year to ending a race to the bottom on corporation tax saying it had deprived national exchequers of revenue for funding vital public services while benefiting footloose multinational corporations. Almost 140 nations including the UK agreed to set a 15% minimum rate.

The IPPR report will raise fresh questions over Kwarteng’s desire to scrap a planned increase in corporation tax to 25% starting in April that had been set in motion by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak.

Urging the government to consider alternative ways to increase investment and economic growth the leftwing thinktank said targeted tax cuts for companies and a commitment to an industrial strategy would have a bigger impact.

George Dibb the head of the Centre for Economic Justice at the IPPR said: “Slashing corporation tax is just a continuation of a failed race to the bottom that hasn’t delivered for the UK economy. Tax cuts are not a magic bullet to increase investment and growth.”

Cuts to the headline rate of corporation tax are not seen as a priority for many business leaders who have been pushing for relief on capital investment to help encourage productivity-boosting spending.

“If the government were serious about boosting investment it would be listening to businesses who want a serious economic strategy to support growth boost innovation and increase our low productivity. Instead it thinks it can cut tax and deregulate its way to growth which has failed before” Dibb added."

Should you buy them?,"Monique An charges her Tesla car to a wall connector charger while posing for photos at her home in San Francisco Thursday Aug. 25 2022.

Electric vehicles gain popularity as new models test and develop technology never seen before. One of the most popular EV manufacturers is Tesla which dominates the U.S. market.

Here are a few things to consider when it comes to Tesla.

Comparisons

Consumer Reports ranked brands and their new models and Elon Musk’s company ended up at the bottom of the list. Lexus Mazda and Toyota were at the top.

On average Tesla cars have 176 mechanical faults per 100 higher than the industry average of 121 according to J.D. Power.

Price tag and credits

The cheapest Tesla Model 3 starts at $46000 and the most expensive starts at $120000. Wondering if the $7500 federal tax credit can soften to the blow? Well it can’t as it was phased out in January 2020. Although electric vehicles may still qualify for state credits.

Low maintenance costs

Electric-powered cars don’t require basic maintenance like oil changes and fuel filters. Tesla is especially big on software updates.

Motor1 estimated the five-year maintenance cost on a Toyota Camry was $4981 or an average of $996 per year. But the five-year cost for a Tesla Model S ran nearly $1500 or $298 per year.

Range and charging

Prospecting for oil in the the early 20th century had come a long way from the days of riding around the prairie on a horse and drilling wherever your hat fell off. Even so however you looked at it the extent to which a geologist could predict the subsurface structure was limited. Anticlines might have been the classic indicator of an oil-bearing structure but only drilling could prove its presence and then often by chance. The advent of ‘remote’ sensing fundamentally changed this.

Salt domes were often associated with oil fields. In 1924 Everette deGolyer discovered the Nash Salt Dome in Texas using an Eötvös torsion balance a device for measuring anomalies in local gravity – the first time that a significant oil field was located by geophysical means in the United States. Gravimeters and magnetometers were subsequently developed and the Schlumberger brothers pioneered electrical surveying in Europe but none of these methods could supplant seismology which arrived on the scene in the 1920s.

Seismology originated from the study of earthquakes many years before it was applied to petroleum exploration. It was understood that sound waves passed through the ground at different velocities according to the density of the rock they encountered and by recording them the subsurface structure could be delineated. During World War I German mining engineer Ludger Mintrop developed a portable seismic device for locating enemy gun emplacements. In 1921 he formed a company named Seismos and three years later a Seismos crew was hired by Gulf Oil to search for shallow salt domes in Texas using the refraction method.

Seismology – the Turning Point

However experiments in reflection seismology marked a turning point. While the refraction method sent sound waves down and then laterally through the Earth the more powerful but expensive reflection method measured waves reflected directly from below. The original research was carried out by Canadian radio pioneer Reginald Fessenden. In September 1917 he patented his ‘Method and Apparatus for Locating Ore Bodies’ a design for sound-generating equipment to be used in geophysical prospecting.

American physicist John C. Karcher who worked for the Sound Section of the US Bureau of Standards on artillery detection was aware of Fessenden’s work on reflection seismology. After the war he researched its possible use in petroleum exploration. In December 1928 based on his earlier findings the Amerada Petroleum Corporation drilled into the Viola limestone formation in Oklahoma and discovered oil – the first well to be drilled in a structure discovered by the reflection method. Karcher’s work earned him the sobriquet ‘Father of Reflection Seismology’.

By now DeGolyer vice president and general manager of Amerada was closely involved with Karcher through a subsidiary the Geophysical Research Corporation. In 1930 with Eugene McDermott and the backing of DeGolyer Karcher launched Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI) which would later become Texas Instruments with GSI as a subsidiary. The reflection method more suited to greater depths and marine environments than refraction became a primary means of petroleum exploration although the latter still had a role to play.

Out in the Field

Deep in the southern tip of Canada’s vast coniferous belt dotted with innumerable muskeg haunted by wails of coyote and wolf Western F-53 maintains the company colors in this wild and rugged no man’s land 300 miles northwest of the provincial capital city of Edmonton.

By the 1950s seismic crews were operating across the continent albeit with differences in working conditions between prairie mountain desert or sea; it was not all camping in the wilderness but in some cases a question of finding accommodation in a nearby town. We can imagine the scene when a survey party set off in convoy for a new location. At times they would leave town in multiple convoys in order to throw oil scouts off the scent and prevent them from discovering their new survey locations.

Research included published literature and work on theoretical mathematics. Dr Milton Dobrin’s Introduction to Geophysical Prospecting was the most influential textbook of its day. But essentially it was field work that kept the wheels of the industry turning. By the 1960s the cost of geophysical and geological surveys could vary considerably sometimes exceeding the drilling costs of a well ranging over several months or years from between $20000 to $50000 ($425000 today) a month with only a few prospects in return. Nevertheless it often made sense to drill since the additional costs would only be nominal when compared with those that had gone before.

Exploration was a lengthy business: there was the time needed to plan contract a seismic crew and a company to acquire and process the data perhaps within a weather window and then finally to interpret it which often took years before there were results to drill upon. What was acquired processed and reprocessed depended on the cost of drilling a well the requirements of governments and the type and duration of a concession.

Seismic is King

After World War II innovations such as the airborne magnetometer computers and magnetic tape were increasingly used. The mid-1950s saw the introduction of sonic logs which brought greater precision to measuring the depth of structures identified by seismology. Since seismic data is usually measured in time and geophysicists geologists and drillers work in depth the process of depth conversion to produce maps and make drilling progress was an important part of exploration and development. If a depth conversion was incorrect expected reservoir levels could be hundreds of metres too deep or too shallow bringing increased exploration costs and risk.

Magnetic tape allowed relatively large amounts of data to be recorded and analysed and seismic reflections to be manipulated to cut out extraneous ‘noise’ and enhance the essential signal. In an Alaskan summer for example the sound of ice thawing vegetation moving and the wind blowing could interfere with seismic surveys while in the winter the freezing of the ice had a similar effect. But that was in the days of old-style single-fold shooting which was replaced by common depth shooting (CDP) a technique invented by Harry Mayne of the Petty Geophysical Engineering Company that cancelled much of the ‘noise’ around seismic readings. With magnetic tape companies could process the extra data in a cost-effective way.

Computing Power

By 1972 the power of computers and the range of data acquisition were such that 3D imaging was technically possible. After a brainstorming session at GSI headquarters in Dallas and with the support of six major oil companies Bell Lake field in New Mexico was chosen as the test site. The results were remarkable: now seismic sections of the subsurface could be displayed in any orientation. However it took time to catch on. Until the arrival of workstations in the 1980s seismic was still interpreted on paper with coloured crayons stratigraphic horizons and faults were picked by an interpreter and digitised and maps were contoured by hand.

The innovations went on. It became possible to measure relative wave amplitudes and directly identify the presence of hydrocarbons or so-called ‘bright spots’. With the addition of time 3D surveys became 4D and could show how reservoirs changed over a period. Pre-stack depth migrated seismic (PSDM) was used for imaging complex features adjacent to or beneath salt in the Gulf of Mexico. In post-seismic processing many things could be done to present the data by emphasising or filtering features to clarify the image or subsurface prospects the connectivity of faults and the like. An application named the coherence cube focused on 3D seismic discontinuities and revealed stratigraphic features and faults that were not immediately visible in other seismic programmes.

With the shale revolution there was a rush to reprocess older seismic surveys and many operators seeking partners and money to do new 3D surveys taking advantage of the latest upgrades in recording and processing technologies. Microseismic technology was used to review and guide the effectiveness of fracking operations and assist in locating adjacent wells. These days there are only a few seismic companies operating onshore although the new technologies have given rise to a small market for reshooting areas that were considered poor quality seismic areas.

Making Waves

In 1936 geophysicist Maurice Ewing whose ground-breaking work on ocean basins opened a new field of marine seismology approached an executive of a large oil company for support and was told they were not interested in searching for oil at sea. It has since transpired that the sedimentary basins of the kind investigated by Ewing are the source of vast deposits of oil. Nearly all the marine discoveries have been made with seismic devices.

Dynamite the seismic source of choice in the past has been replaced by more environmentally friendly methods. ‘Thumper’ trucks which drop a weight on the ground were introduced in 1953 as an alternative to dynamite. However since Conoco introduced hydraulic vibrators in the mid-1950s vibroseis trucks have become the most common seismic method on land providing a continuous signal and being less destructive than other methods. The seismic air-gun was invented in the 1960s and is often used as the seismic source at sea. Towed behind seismic survey vessels arrays of air-guns release high pressure air pulses that penetrate the ocean floor.

Whatever their source seismic signals create compression waves (P waves) and shear waves (Sh and Sv). Typically geophones record these modes using three components (3C recording or 4C recording in the sea where an extra hydrophone is used). Accelerometers which measure acceleration as opposed to velocity have a greater range than geophones and are often used in 3C and 4C recording. While P waves propagate through water collecting data with a marine cable containing geophones (a ‘streamer’) towed behind a vessel is fraught.

The slightest motion generates ‘noise’ so the offshore industry uses hydrophones these being detectors that respond to pressure changes in the surrounding medium. Ocean-bottom recording is used to record shear wave data which cannot travel through water. Broadband seismic allows deeper imaging and towing streamers at different depths and using sampling pairs such as pressure and velocity fields reduces reflections from the sea surface (‘ghosting’).

Emerging Technologies

Today the purpose of seismology in petroleum exploration remains essentially the same to identify oil and gas prospects and to assist the development of discoveries. But the technologies and the acquisition processing and interpretation of seismic data have evolved with the development of computing power and workstations making it possible to develop deeper and clearer images of the subsurface and beneath salt and basalts.

The geophysicist can image hydrocarbons from Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHIs) and fluid contacts and movement via time-lapse surveys. Fibre optics are in vogue instead of geophones in boreholes where information is derived from the deformation in a fibre optic cable caused by seismic waves – a recent development is to make the fibre optics biodegradable.

There are plenty of derivatives of good quality offshore data worldwide like Exxon’s model for oil exploration based on seismic stratigraphy and global sea level change. This was of particular interest to the oil industry because it enabled sequences to be predicted and thus be correlated on a regional scale and represented a paradigm shift in geology. Technology is improving all the time and it is common to reshoot time-lapse surveys every few years particularly over producing assets.

The upshot of these innovations has been to lower the element of risk in petroleum exploration. Since it is possible to predict the presence of hydrocarbons more accurately than by simply delineating structures and traps the uncertainty and cost of drilling for oil are greatly reduced. This in turn has allowed companies to invest in new technologies such as larger deepwater platforms that take petroleum exploration to new frontiers.

Image Provided by Jeremy S. Cook Perhaps you remember the early voice synthesizers of the 1980s which “spoke” in a muffled marginally intelligible tone. Audio data storage was based on a linear predictive coding (LPC) format and played back with a voice synthesis processor (VSP).

Texas Instruments’ Speak & Spell educational toy was perhaps the most iconic device that used this sort of technology and if you’re nostalgic for this “soothing” voice you can generate this type of speech using an Arduino and the Talkie library.

This library which was first published in 2012 by Peter Knight appears to now be updated and maintained by Armin Joachimsmeyer linked here by Arduino. It takes LPC sound files and uses an Arduino to act as the VSP. Long story short load up “talkie” via the Arduino IDE’s library manager program your Arduino with a provided example and it’s ready to output sound via GPIO pins.

Assuming you’re using an Arduino Uno (other boards are also supported) connect a small speaker to a combination of pins 3 11 and ground. 3 is the normal output and 11 is the inverted speech output so if you hook both 3 and 11 up the sound output will be greater than if you connect to one output and ground. Send the Getting_Started.ino sketch to your board and you’ll hear it say “danger danger red alert motor is on fire.”

This setup could hardly be simpler to use. Remember to use an actual speaker not a buzzer. Either will output sound but the buzzer quality will be much worse. You can also use an amplifier for additional volume and there’s an optional filtering circuit to cut down on clicks and pops.

Rearrange Say What You Want

If you examine the Getting_Started.ino file you’ll note that clips are played in sequence via lines like voice.say(sp2_DANGER);. You can rearrange the sequence but check out the Vocab_US_Large.h file found here to examine all the available clips in that speech package. Insert the appropriate variable from the header file i.e. “sp5_TELEPHONE” or “sp3_ERROR” and it’ll speak whatever is stored therein.

Different vocabulary packages are available which you can browse in the library’s source directory. If you find one that works better (or in addition) to Vocab_US_large then include that as well or instead. You can also directly insert the hex values from the corresponding .cpp file which could be convenient in some situations.

Custom Sound Clips

Between the various vocabulary files you have a large number of words from which to choose but maybe there’s something else you’d like to say. Custom wording is entirely possible though it will take a bit of finagling.

As outlined on the GitHub page and in the video below (with a bit of background information on LPC and VSP) you’ll first need to record (or source) an audio clip. Convert it to the proper .wav format via this online converter (16 bit 8000 Hertz). Then run it through either python_wizard or BlueWizard on a Macintosh to convert it to the proper LPC format. This will give you a series of hex values which you can then insert directly into your Arduino code for playback.

Having tried this using BlueWizard it’s a pretty approachable procedure though you’ll want to play around with the settings to make sure what you say can still be heard. Also be sure to check “include hex prefix (0x)” when using that software. While LPC playback leaves much to be desired from a quality perspective the format does have a very cool retro sound and can run on the humble Arduino Uno and similar boards without additional hardware.

In addition to a separate attack in the south the missiles have been a key component in Ukraine's dramatic attack in the Kharkiv area.

The AGM-88 HARM missile?

HARM is the abbreviation used for the AGM-88 HARM air-to-surface missile. It is a tool of war fired from fighter jets that possess the capability to monitor and aim radiation emitted by adversary radar systems with ground detection capabilities.

Although Raytheon Corporation a prominent American defence contractor currently manufactures the missile it was initially designed by Texas Instruments a Dallas-based corporation.

AFP

An extended edition of the missile is manufactured by Northrop Grumman which has its base in Dulles Virginia.

While being only 10 inches in diameter the AGM-88 HARM is 14 metres long. It weighs approximately 360 kg and has a fragmentation-type explosive suited for radar locations. Additionally it contains a solid-state digital CPU and an anti-radar homing seeker broadband RF transmitter and receiver. The missile can go more than 100 kilometres.

Russian speculations concerning AGM-88 HARM.

According to various reports Russian Telegram users have recently been disseminating open-source information. That information states that a few AGM-88 HARM remains were discovered close to a Russian surface-to-air missile installation.

The remains displayed authentic serial numbers that might be linked to AGM-88 HARM according to analysts of open-source intelligence. Additionally the US supports these inferences.

AFP/Representational Image

The Indian Express reports that over the past few days Russian social media users have been disseminating unofficial information on Telegram about the discovery of AGM-88 HARM remnants close to a Russian surface-to-air missile installation. Open-source intelligence specialists correlated the AGM-88 HARM to the images of the missile's purported remains since they appeared to show legitimate registration numbers.

The US government has now validated these deductions.

Ukraine's platform to use AGM-88 HARM

This problem has been studied by analysts who evaluate the military. It would seem that only Western armed forces possess the necessary fighter aircraft for the use of these missiles and that Ukraine's fleet of Russian-origin aircraft cannot be equipped with the AGM-88 HARM and utilised as such. AGM-88 HARM warheads can be launched from NATO aircraft in Europe including the Tornado ECR F-16CM Block 50 and F/A-18-EA-18G.

AFP

According to a CNN report the Russia-Ukraine conflict was the first time the weapon has been employed by a military other than the US. Its effectiveness is still being debated given the understocked state of the Ukrainian Air Force's fleet.

According to the same CNN report there is concern that the weapons could have been launched by NATO aircraft secretly backing the Ukrainian forces in combat as Ukraine does not possess warplanes that are recognized to be suitable for the missile.

A look back at previous air defence tactics

AFP/Representational Image

Batteries of heavy anti-aircraft weapons were used to combat bombers during World War II but as soon as jet bombers were capable of flying faster and higher this weaponry was no longer viable. As a result the first radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (sam) started to appear by the late 1940s. These quickly developed and were able to quickly reach stratospheric levels and put the quickest jet to a halt. Then bomber crews had to figure out how to fly underneath the radar or devise means of dodging it including electronic warfare jamming.

During the Vietnam War America invented the Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) strategy. Prior to an attack aircraft wave ""Wild Weasel"" aircraft were tasked with disabling radar. The Wild Weasels initially armed with bombs and subsequently with unique missiles that could target radar possessed radar receivers to find air defences. The most recent version of these air-to-surface missiles called harm has a range of about 90 miles (145 km) weighs about 350 kg and is capable of finding and attacking radar systems even while they are off.

However it would be almost unthinkable that the Textron group as pioneers and leaders of so many facets of vertical flight would not have a strong presence in the development of eVTOL.

In January 2020 Bell revealed a full-scale mock-up of the second Nexus eVTOL aircraft named Nexus 4EX. Bell Image

verticalmag.com took the opportunity speak to Rob Scholl Textron eAviation’s CEO and president to get an update on the Nexus and his outlook for advanced air mobility (AAM).

Scholl confirmed that he continues to oversee the development and expansion of the Nexus program and Pipistrel as Textron eAviation businesses. He leverages the work across Textron’s aerospace and defense businesses to develop new opportunities to take advantage of the group’s fixed-wing and rotorcraft expertise.

He was previously senior vice president of Textron’s eAviation initiative prior to it becoming a Textron business segment. This followed his work as Textron Aviation’s senior vice president of sales leading the global commercial aircraft sales pre-owned sales and flight operations divisions.

In that role he was responsible for global sales initiatives to ensure a strong and direct industry presence to meet customers’ needs for Cessna and Beechcraft jets turboprops and pistons. Scholl also served on the board of directors for FlightSafety Textron Aviation Training.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Alex Scerri: What is the status of the Nexus program and why did it appear at least externally that the project was on the backburner?

Rob Scholl: In fall 2021 the Nexus program was transferred from Bell to Textron eAviation. This enabled the Nexus team to strategically leverage both airplane and rotorcraft engineering expertise from across the Textron enterprise.

The eAviation Nexus team is currently refining systems requirements for the aircraft while simultaneously conducting tests on demonstration articles to include motor conversion actuation loading flight control laws and elements associated with aircraft power and battery management.

This approach leads to a more robust flight demonstration article and allows the team to establish a performance baseline.

Alex Scerri: Were the Bell Nexus 4EX and 6HX programs running concurrently or did the 6HX supersede the 4EX?

Rob Scholl: In January 2020 Bell revealed a full-scale mock-up of the second Nexus urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft named Nexus 4EX. The first Bell Nexus model was renamed the Nexus 6HX (six ducted propellers hybrid-electric power train experimental).

Alex Scerri: Are you still looking at using the hybrid power solution?

Rob Scholl: At the present time the Nexus team is focused on a fully electric propulsion platform for the first prototype aircraft. Pipistrel has experience with building and flying a hybrid-electric aircraft with the Panthera program. That aircraft first flew in 2021 with a hybrid propulsion system and we will leverage that experience to evaluate possible future hybrid-electric solutions for the Nexus and other eAviation programs.

Alex Scerri: Is the aircraft that is being developed now a continuation of the 4EX or 6HX programs or is it a new iteration?

Rob Scholl is the CEO and president of Textron eAviation. Bell Image

Rob Scholl: The Nexus eVTOL is a continuation of the 4EX aircraft. The current Nexus aircraft now has six open rotors — the four wing-mounted rotors tilt between vertical and horizontal flight and the two rear rotors on the tail booms are fixed to produce vertical thrust.

Alex Scerri: What does Pipistrel bring to the Textron group in terms of expertise in eVTOL and could there be a shift to different architecture than the tiltrotor?

Rob Scholl: Pipistrel is the world leader in electric aviation having type-certified the only electric aircraft in the world. Pipistrel is already developing the Nuuva V300 hybrid eVTOL uncrewed cargo aircraft. This experience will support Textron throughout the Nexus program. Given Pipistrel’s strong experience in aviation-grade electric propulsion we will leverage their experience and skill across Textron including the Nexus program.

Alex Scerri: Where will the program be based?

Rob Scholl: Currently Textron eAviation has a dedicated team in Wichita Kansas leading the Nexus program. The business segment is also drawing upon support from Textron’s other divisions including Bell Textron Aviation McCauley Propeller automotive supplier Kautex and Pipistrel.

Alex Scerri: What are your timelines — from prototype to first conforming production aircraft to certification?

Rob Scholl: The Nexus team is currently designing a full-scale prototype of the Nexus and is planning to fly this within a couple of years. The entry-into-service date is dependent on technology and regulatory development as well as batteries motors and operations.

Alex Scerri: What is your outlook as far as regulation for AAM in the U.S. for certification and operation of eVTOLs?

Rob Scholl: Making regulatory transformations such as these require dedicated industry-regulator collaboration. We are fortunate to have a strong relationship with regulators in the AAM space and will continue to work with them to chart a course forward and determine where Nexus fits into that course.

Textron has extensive experience over the last 10-plus years in design building and certifying a variety of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. The current timeline for U.S. certification is unclear for AAM. We believe our industry leading experience will allow us to partner with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to help define the pathway over the next decade.

Alex Scerri: What do you think were the concrete takeaways from the recent White House Summit on AAM?

Rob Scholl: The AAM conference hosted by the White House Office of Science and Technology was a great opportunity for industry and government officials to come together to discuss the great potential of AAM. My takeaway is that there is strong potential for the U.S. in the design manufacturing and use of AAM both cargo and passenger transportation.

Industry and government must come together to define the regulatory and infrastructure roadmap to enable the benefits of AAM. If the U.S. continues to lag in this area the country risks falling behind other regions of the world including Europe. With Textron’s experience in designing aircraft that work for our customers we stand ready to partner with the U.S. government in this work.

Alex Scerri: Is there anything else you would like to share with the eVTOL community?

Rob Scholl: At Textron we are confident in the bright future of AAM. Given our wealth of experience I would caution participants in the AAM market to be ready for the challenging road ahead. Many companies are setting very aggressive expectations for market timing and growth. We know that the path to designing and certifying a viable aircraft can be technically challenging and capital intensive. I would recommend that the eVTOL community evaluate partners to ensure they have the technical and market expertise necessary for the journey to the future of AAM.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5L2JlbGwtc2VsZWN0cy1zaWVycmEtbmV2YWRhLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9uLWZvci1pdHMtaHN2dG9sLXRlYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bell Selects Sierra Nevada Corporation for its HSVTOL team,"Bell Selects Sierra Nevada Corporation for its HSVTOL team Bell Textron Inc announced today it has entered into a teaming agreement with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) for Bell’s High-Speed Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HSVTOL) aircraft.

FISH images from GBMs were obtained from patients treated at UCLA participating in a multi-institutional phase II clinical trial of lapatinib sponsored by the North American Brain Tumor Consortium NABTC 04-01 a biomarker and phase II study of lapatinib GW572016 (lapatinib) in recurrent GBM. The collection and use of patient samples was approved by the UCLA institutional review board. These samples have been described previously including in Nathanson et al.9. FISH images from NBs were acquired as part of routine molecular tumor diagnostics. Patients were registered and treated according to the trial protocols of the Society of Paediatric Oncology European Neuroblastoma Network HR-NBL-1 trial (NCT01704716) or the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) NB2004 trial. This study was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and good clinical practice; informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians. The collection and use of patient specimens was approved by the institutional review boards of the St. Anna Kinderspital in Vienna the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Medical Faculty University of Cologne. Specimens and clinical data were archived and made available by Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin the St. Anna Kinderspital or the National Neuroblastoma Biobank and Neuroblastoma Trial Registry (University Children’s Hospital Cologne) of the GPOH.

Cell culture

Cell lines were purchased from ATCC or the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Leibniz Institute) or were a kind gift from J.H. Schulte. GBM39-HSR and GBM39-EC were derived from a patient with GBM as described previously9. Hap1 cells (Horizon Discovery) were maintained in IMDM supplemented with GlutaMAX and 10% FCS (Gibco).

PC3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. COLO320-HSR and COLO320-DM were cultured in DMEM/F12 50:50% with 10% FCS. SNU16 were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 with 10% FCS. GBM39-HSR and GBM39-EC neurospheres were grown in DMEM/F12 with B27 GlutaMAX heparin (5 μg ml−1) EGF (20 ng ml−1) and fibroblast growth factor (20 ng ml−1). TR14 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 20% FCS. Cell numbers were counted with a TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For drug treatments the drug was replaced every 3–4 d.

Metaphase chromosome spreads

Cells were concentrated in metaphase by treatment with KaryoMAX Colcemid (Gibco) at 100 ng ml−1 for between 3 h and overnight (depending on the cell cycle speed). Cells were washed once with PBS and a single-cell suspension was incubated in 75 mM KCl for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with Carnoy’s fixative (3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid) and spun down. Cells were washed with fixative three additional times. Cells were then dropped onto humidified glass slides.

FISH

Fixed samples on coverslips or slides were equilibrated briefly in 2× SSC buffer. They were then dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations of 70 85 and 100% for approximately 2 min each. FISH probes were diluted in hybridization buffer (Empire Genomics) and added to the sample with the addition of a coverslip or slide. Samples were denatured at 72 °C for 2 min and then hybridized at 37 °C overnight in a humid and dark chamber. Samples were then washed with 0.4× SSC then 2× SSC 0.1% Tween 20 (all washes lasting approximately 2 min). 46-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (100 ng ml−1) was applied to samples for 10 min. Samples were then washed again with 2× SSC 0.1% Tween 20 then 2× SSC. Samples were briefly washed in double-distilled H 2 O and mounted with ProLong Gold. Slides were sealed with nail polish.

Dual immunofluorescence–FISH

Asynchronous cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips (laminin for GBM39-EC). Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 10–15 min. Samples were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Samples were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS 0.05% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (1:100–1:200) for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in PBS 0.05% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated in secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (all subsequent steps in the dark) and then washed three times in PBS 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were washed once with PBS and refixed with cold 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS then once with 2× SSC buffer. FISH proceeded as described above with the following difference: denaturation was performed at 80 °C for 20 min.

Microscopy

Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX43 microscope; images were acquired with a QIClick cooled camera. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP8 microscope with lightning deconvolution (University of California San Diego School of Medicine Microscopy Core). NB cell lines were imaged with a Leica TCS SP5 microscope HCC PL APO lambda blue ×63 1.4 oil lens or with DeltaVision Elite Cell Imaging System (Applied Precision) and microscope (model IX-71; Olympus) controlled by the SoftWoRx software v.6.5.2 (Applied Precision) and a 60x objective lens with a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Photometrics).

NB patient tissue FISH

FISH analysis was performed on 4-µm sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks. Slides were deparaffinized dehydrated and incubated in pretreatment solution (Dako) for 10 min at 95–99 °C. Samples were treated with pepsin solution for 2 min at 37 °C. For hybridization the ZytoLight SPEC MYCN/2q11 Dual Color Probe (ZytoVision) was used. Incubation took place overnight at 37 °C followed by counterstaining with DAPI. For each case signals were counted in 50 nonoverlapping tumor cells using a fluorescence microscope (BX63 Automated Fluorescence Microscope; Olympus). Computer-based documentation and image analysis was performed with the SoloWeb Imaging System (BioView Ltd) MYCN amplification (MYCN FISH+) was defined as an MYCN/2q11.2 ratio >4.0 as described in the INRG report32.

Quantification of FISH foci

Quantification of FISH foci was performed using the ImageJ Find plugin maxima function in a supervised fashion. To quantify pixel intensity the ImageJ Pixel intensity function was used. The FISH images of the tissue of these two patients with GBM were obtained as part of a phase II lapatinib GBM clinical trial described previously. In brief patients were administered 750 mg of lapatinib orally twice a day for 7–10 days (depending on whether the treatment interval fell over a weekend) before surgery the time to steady state. Blood and tissue samples were obtained at the time of resection9.

Construction of PC3-TetO cell line

The insertion of TetO repeats was conducted through CRISPR–cas9-mediated approaches. The plasmids pSP2-96-mer TetO-EFS-BlaR and F9-TetR-EGFP-IRES-PuroR used in this were kind gifts from H. Zhao21. Briefly the intergenic region between MYC and PVT1 was selected as the insertion region on the basis that it is amplified in PC3 cells on ecDNA with high frequency. DNA sequences were retrieved from the UCSC Genome Brower; repetitive and low complexity DNA sequences were annotated and masked by RepeatMasker in the UCSC Genome Browser. The guide sequences of sgRNAs were designed by the CRISPRdirect web tool33 and their amplification was confirmed with whole-genome sequencing data. The guide sequence selected was constructed into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459). pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro(PX459) was a gift from F. Zhang (Addgene plasmid no. 62988; http://n2t.net/addgene:62988; research resource identifier: Addgene_62988). The repair donor was obtained through PCR amplification using the pSP2-96-merTetO-EFS-BlaR plasmid as template as well as primers containing the 50-nucleotide homology arm upstream and downstream of the predicted cutting site.

The transfection of the CRISPR–Cas9 plasmid and 96-mer TetO EGFP-BlastR donor into PC3 cells was conducted with the X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the CRISPR–Cas9 plasmid only or the 96-mer TetO EGFP-BlastR only used as negative control. Two days after transfection blasticidin was added to the culture medium for 3 d at a time point when most of the cells in the negative control groups had died while more cells survived in the group with transfection of the CRISPR–Cas9 plasmid and donor. The surviving cells were subjected to limited dilution in a 96-well plate with blasticidin being added all the time. Surviving clones were expanded and their genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted and subjected to genotyping with a pair of primers flanking the inserted region. The PCR product of the genotyping results was subjected to Sanger sequencing to confirm the insertion at the predicted cutting site. Clones with positive genotyping bands were expanded and metaphase cells were collected. Double FISH with FISH probe against the Tet operator and against the MYC FISH probe was performed on the metaphase spread. PC3 cells with TetO repeats were infected with lentivirus containing F9-TetR-EGFP-IRES-PuroR; 2 d after infection puromycin was added to the culture medium to establish a stable cell line that could be used to image ecDNA with the aid of EGFP visualization.

Live-cell imaging of ecDNA

The PC3 TetO TetR-GFP cell line was transfected with a PiggyBac vector expressing H2B-SNAPf and the super PiggyBac transposase (2:1 ratio) as described previously34. Stable transfectants were selected by 500 µg ml−1 G418 and sorted by flow cytometry. To facilitate long-term time-lapse imaging 10 µg ml−1 human fibronectin was coated in each well of an 8-well Lab-Tek chambered cover glass. Before imaging cells were stained with 25 nM SNAP tag ligand JF 669 (ref. 22) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by 3 washes with regular medium for 30 min in total. Cells were then transferred to an imaging buffer containing 20% serum in 1× Opti-Klear live-cell imaging buffer at 37 °C. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM880 microscope prestabilized at 37 °C for 2 h. We illuminated the sample with a 1.5% 488-nm laser and 0.75% 633-nm laser with the EC Plan-Neofluar ×40/1.30 oil lens beam splitter MBS 488/561/633 and filters BP 495–550 + LP 570. Z-stacks were acquired with a 0.3-µm z step size with 4-min intervals between each volumetric imaging for a total of 16 h.

Colony formation assay

TR14 cells were taken from 60 d of treatment with either dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 50 nM palbociclib or 5 nM abemaciclib and seeded into a poly-D-lysine-coated 24-well plate at 20000 cells per well. After 24 h the cells from each condition were treated with either DMSO 50 nM palbociclib or 5 nM abemaciclib over 20 d in triplicate. At 20 d crystal violet staining was performed. Briefly the cell culture medium was aspirated cells were washed gently with PBS fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min stained with 2 ml crystal violet solution (50 mg in 50 ml 10% ethanol in Milli-Q water) washed once with PBS and dried for 30 min. The area intensity was calculated using the ColonyArea plugin in ImageJ v2 (NIH)35.

CellTiter-Glo

TR14 cells were taken from 60 d of treatment with either DMSO 50 nM palbociclib or 5 nM abemaciclib and seeded into white flat-bottom 96-well plates (Corning) in 100 µl medium at a density of 500 cells per well. After 24 h cells were treated with either vehicle 50 nM palbociclib or 5 nM abemaciclib (50 µl of drug solution per well). Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega Corporation) at 3 6 and 9 d after the drug was added according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Flow cytometry

Single-cell suspensions were made and passed through a cell filter to ensure single-cell suspension. Cells were suspended in flow cytometry buffer (Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution buffer without calcium and magnesium 1× GlutaMAX 0.5% (v/v) FCS 10 mM HEPES). EGFRvIII monoclonal antibody 806 (ref. 36) was added at 1 μg per million cells and incubated on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed in flow cytometry buffer and resuspended in buffer with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:1000 catalog no. A11017; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed again with flow cytometry buffer and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer at approximately 4 million cells per milliliter. Cells were sorted using a Sony SH800 FACS sorter which was calibrated; gating was informed using a secondary-only negative control. The sorting strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 14.

Quantitative PCR

DNA extraction was performed using the NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using 50 ng or 1.5 µl of template DNA and 0.5 µM primers with the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in FrameStar 96-well PCR plates (4titude). Reactions were run and monitored on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Ct values were calculated with the StepOne Plus software v.2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific): CDK4 forward: AAAGTTACCACCACACCCCC; CDK4 reverse: AGTGCTAAGAAAGCGGCACT.

Guide RNA design for CRISPR-C

sgRNAs were designed to target the ends of a previously reported DHFR-containing ecDNA amplicon (clone: PD29424h)17; 1000 base pairs (bp) of sequence flanking each end of this segment (Chr5: 79841431–81655326; hg19) were used to design guides using the Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) Custom Alt-R CRISPR–Cas9 guide RNA software (https://www.idtdna.com/site/order/designtool/index/CRISPR_CUSTOM). These sequences were ordered as Alt-R sgRNAs (IDT).

ecDNA induction by CRISPR-C

Hap1 cells were trypsinized quenched with IMDM (GlutaMAX 10% FCS) counted and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Cells were washed once with PBS before resuspension in Neon Resuspension Buffer to 1.1 × 107 cells ml−1. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were formed as follows: Cas9 (IDT) was diluted to 36 μM in Neon Resuspension Buffer. Equal volumes of diluted Cas9 and sgRNA (44 μM in TE pH 8.0) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10–20 min. Left (DHFR_H2_sgL) and right (DHFR_H2_sgR) sgRNA RNPs were assembled separately. Then 5.5 μl of each RNP 5.5 22 μl of electroporation enhancer (10.8 μM; IDT) and 99 μl of cells were mixed and electroporated according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a 100-μl Neon pipet tip and electroporated with the Neon Transfection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following settings: 1575 V 10-ms pulse width 3 pulses. Single-guide controls were prepared as above except 11 μl of the appropriate sgRNA was used. Electroporated cells were dispensed into 3.2 ml of medium (± hypoxanthine and thymidine supplementation as appropriate) and split into 6 wells of a 24-well plate. Negative electroporation control cells were resuspended in Neon Resuspension Buffer and then added directly to wells containing fresh medium.

For neutral selection cells were cultured in 24-well plates and passaged every 2 d. During passaging 80–90% of the cells in each well were used for gDNA isolation while the rest were transferred to a new plate containing fresh medium. For hypoxanthine- and thymidine-supplemented wells hypoxanthine and thymidine supplement (100X catalog no. 11067030; Gibco) was added to final concentrations of 100 μΜ hypoxanthine and 16 μΜ thymidine.

For positive selection 3 d after electroporation cells were passaged into 12-well plates and the day 3 time point was collected. Cells were changed to medium containing the indicated concentration of methotrexate (Calbiochem) 4 d after electroporation. Medium was changed every 2–3 days and cells were passaged when at 70–80% confluence. Cells were collected after 14 days of methotrexate incubation (18 days after electroporation). The final DMSO concentration in methotrexate-treated wells was 0.1%.

Cells were collected at the indicated time points as follows: cells were washed with 1 ml per well prewarmed PBS (Gibco) followed by the addition of 100 μl TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubation at 37 °C for 5–10 min. TrypLE was quenched with 800 μl IMDM (GlutaMAX 10% FCS) and the cell suspension was pelleted at 300 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets were stored at −80 °C.

The CRISPR-C schematic was created with BioRender.

ddPCR to determine ecDNA or chromosomal scar frequency

gDNA was isolated using DNeasy columns (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions including a 10-min incubation at 56 °C during the proteinase K digestion step; DNA was eluted with 100 μl EB buffer.

Amplicons for the ecDNA junction chromosomal scar junction and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were designed using the IDT PrimerQuest software (https://www.idtdna.com/PrimerQuest/Home/Index). Dual-quenched probes (IDT) were used: FAM-labeled probes were used for both the ecDNA and chromosomal scar junction amplicons to facilitate multiplexing with the GAPDH amplicon utilizing a HEX-labeled probe. All probe and primer sequences are available in Supplementary Information. Droplets were created using droplet-generating oil for probes DG8 cartridges DG8 gaskets and the QX200 Droplet generator (Bio-Rad Laboratories); amplification was performed using the ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The ddPCR Supermix amplification reactions were set up according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Approximately 60 ng of gDNA was used in a 20 μl reaction with a final primer concentration of 900 nM (225 nM for each primer) 125 nM FAM probe and 125 nM HEX probe. The reaction was partitioned into droplets for amplification according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Droplets were transferred to a 96-well PCR plate and heat-sealed using the PX1 PCR plate sealer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Droplets were amplified using the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 10 min 40 cycles (94 °C for 30 s 56.1 °C for 60 s) 98 °C for 10 min. After thermal cycling droplets were scanned individually using the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Positive and negative droplets in each fluorescent channel (HEX FAM) were distinguished on the basis of fluorescence amplitude using a global threshold set by the minimal intrinsic fluorescence signal resulting from imperfect quenching of the fluorogenic probes (negative droplets) compared to the strong fluorescence signal from cleaved probes in droplets with amplified template(s). The frequency of ecDNA or chromosomal scar was calculated by dividing their measured concentration by the concentration of the GAPDH amplicon.

Quantification of single-cell ecDNA segregation patterns

We generated the theoretically expected distribution of ecDNA copy number fractions after a single cell division under different models of ecDNA segregation by stochastic computer simulations implemented in C++. Briefly a single cell is initiated with a random number of ecDNA copies n drawn from a uniform distribution U(20200). EcDNA is amplified and 2n ecDNA copies are segregated between two daughter cells after a binomial trial B(2n p) with segregation probability p. In this case p = 1/2 corresponds to random segregation and p > 1/2 to a biased random segregation. This results in two daughter cells with ecDNA copy number n 1 ≈ B(2n p) and n 2 = n − n 1 . The fraction of segregated ecDNA f is then calculated as:

\(f_1 = \frac{{n_1}}{{n_1 + n_2}}\{{{\mathrm{and}}}}\f_2 = \frac{{n_2}}{{n_1 + n_2}}.\)

Iterating the process 107 times generates the expected distribution of f as shown in Fig. 1c. Similarly we generated an expected distribution of f for chromosomal patterns of inheritance. For perfect chromosomal segregation we have f 1 = f 2 = 1/2. To allow for mis-segregation we introduced a probability u = 0.05 such that n 1 = n ± 1 and n 2 = n − n 1 . We used Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics to compare the theoretically expected and experimentally observed distributions of ecDNA copy number fractions under these different scenarios.

Stochastic simulations of ecDNA population dynamics

We implemented individually based stochastic computer simulations of the ecDNA population dynamics in C++. For each cell the exact number of ecDNA copies was recorded through the simulation. Cells were chosen randomly but proportional to fitness for proliferation using a Gillespie algorithm. The simulation was initiated with one cell carrying n 0 copies of ecDNA. The proliferation rate of cells without ecDNA was set to r− = 1 (time is measured in generations). A fitness effect for cells with ecDNA then corresponded to a proliferation rate r+ = s. In this example s > 1 models a fitness advantage 0 < s < 1 a fitness disadvantage and s = 1 corresponds to no fitness difference (neutral dynamics r+ = r−). During proliferation the number of ecDNA copies in that cell are doubled and randomly distributed into both daughter cells according to a binomial trail B(n p) with success rate p = 1/2. If a cell carries no ecDNA no daughter cell inherits ecDNA. We terminated simulations at a specified cell population size. We output the copy number of ecDNA for each cell at the end of each simulation which allowed us to construct other quantities of interest such as the ecDNA copy number distribution the time dynamics of moments the power law scaling of tails or Shannon diversity index. We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics to test similarity between simulated and experimental ecDNA copy number distributions and Shapiro–Wilk statistics to test for deviations from normality.

Sampling and resolution limits

We ran an in silico trial to test our ability to reconstruct the true ecDNA copy number distribution from a sampled subset of varying sizes. We constructed a simulated ecDNA copy number distribution from 2 × 106 cells using our stochastic simulations. We then performed 500 random samples of 25 50 100 and 500 cells reconstructed the sampled ecDNA copy number distribution and compared similarity to the true copy number distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics. The distribution converges to the true distribution with increasing sampling size and a comparably small sample of 100–500 cells is sufficient to reconstruct the true underlying ecDNA copy number distribution.

Mathematical description of ecDNA dynamics

Deterministic two-population model without selection

In the simplest representation of the model we discriminated cells that did or did not carry copies of ecDNA. We denoted cells with copies of ecDNA as N+(t) and cells without copies of ecDNA with N−(t). We can write for the change of these cells in time t:

$$\frac{{\partial N^ - \left( t \right)}}{{\partial t}} = N^ - \left( t \right) + \upsilon \left( {N^ + \left( t \right)} \right)N^ + \left( t \right)$$

$$\frac{{\partial N^ + (t)}}{{\partial t}} = N^ + \left( t \right) - \upsilon (N^ + \left( t \right))N^ + (t)$$

where \(\upsilon \left( {N^ + \left( t \right)} \right)\) corresponds to the loss rate of random complete asymmetric ecDNA segregation. We found for the fraction of cells carrying ecDNA f+(t) in an exponentially growing population:

$$f^ + (t) = \frac{2}{{2 + t}}$$

The fraction of cells carrying ecDNA decreases with approximately 1/t if ecDNA is neutral. Thus copies of neutral ecDNA are only present in a small subpopulation of tumor cells.

Deterministic two-population model with selection

The above equations can be modified to allow for a fitness advantage s > 1 for cells carrying ecDNA:

$$\frac{{\partial N^ - \left( t \right)}}{{\partial t}} = N^ - \left( t \right) + s\upsilon \left( {N^ + \left( t \right)} \right)N^ + \left( t \right)$$

$$\frac{{\partial N^ + (t)}}{{\partial t}} = sN^ + \left( t \right) - s\upsilon (N^ + \left( t \right))N^ + (t)$$

The solution to this set of equations is:

$$N^ + \left( t \right) = \left( {1 - f^ - } \right){\mathrm{e}}^{st - (1 - s){\int}_0^t {f^ - } (\tau ){\mathrm{d}}\tau }$$

In the case of positive selection the fraction of cells with ecDNA is \(f^ + \to 1\). For a sufficiently long time the tumor will be dominated by cells carrying ecDNA.

Stochastic dynamics of neutral ecDNA

We were also interested in the stochastic properties of ecDNA dynamics in a growing population. Therefore we moved to a more fine-grained picture and considered the number of cells N k (t) with k copies of ecDNA at time t. The dynamic equation for neutral copies of ecDNA becomes:

$$\frac{{\partial N_k(t)}}{{\partial t}} = - N_k\left( t \right) + 2\mathop {\sum}\limits_{i = k/2}^\infty {N_i(t)} \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {2i} \\ k \end{array}} \right)\frac{1}{{2^{2i}}}$$

It is more convenient to work with the cell density ρ instead of cell number N. Normalizing the above equation we get for the density ρ k of cells with k ecDNA copies:

$$\frac{{\partial \rho _k(t)}}{{\partial t}} = - 2\rho _k\left( t \right) + 2\mathop {\sum}\limits_{i = k/2}^\infty {\rho _i(t)} \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {2i} \\ k \end{array}} \right)\frac{1}{{2^{2i}}}$$

Moment dynamics for neutral ecDNA copies

With the above equation for the density of cells with k ecDNA copies we can calculate the moments of the underlying probability density function. In general the lth moment can by calculated via:

$$M^{\left( l \right)}\left( t \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_{i = 0}^\infty {i^l} \rho _i(t)$$

It can be shown that all moments scale with \(M^{\left( l \right)}(t)\approx t^{l - 1}\) and we found explicitly for the first two moments:

\(M^{(1)} = 1\{{{\mathrm{and}}}}\M^{\left( 2 \right)}\left( t \right) = t.\)

The mean ecDNA copy number in an exponentially growing population is constant for neutral ecDNA copies. The variance of the ecDNA copy number increases linearly in time.

Stochastic dynamics of ecDNA under positive selection

The above equations can be generalized to accommodate positive selection (s > 1) for ecDNA copies. The set of dynamic equations for cell densities becomes:

$$\left. {\frac{{\partial \rho _k\left( t \right)}}{{\partial t}}} \right|_{k > 0} = s\left. {\frac{{\partial \rho _k\left( t \right)}}{{\partial t}}} \right|_{s = 1} + \left( {s - 1} \right)\rho _k\rho _0$$

$$\frac{{\partial \rho _0(t)}}{{\partial t}} = s\left. {\frac{{\partial \rho _k(t)}}{{\partial t}}} \right|_{s = 1} + (s - 1)(1 - \rho _0)\rho _0$$

A general solution to these equations is challenging. Nonetheless important quantities for example the moment dynamics and scaling behavior can be calculated explicitly.

Moment dynamics for ecDNA under positive selection

A generalized equation for the dynamics of moments directly follows from the above equations. We have:

$$\frac{{\partial M^{\left( l \right)}(t)}}{{\partial t}} = s\left. {\frac{{\partial M^{\left( l \right)}(t)}}{{\partial t}}} \right|_{s = 1} + \left( {s - 1} \right)\rho _0M^{\left( l \right)}(t)$$

This implies for the first moment \(\frac{{\partial M^{\left( 1 \right)}(t)}}{{\partial t}} = (s - 1)\rho _0M^{\left( 1 \right)}(t)\) which then can be solved for the first moment:

$$M^{\left( 1 \right)}\left( t \right) = {\mathrm{e}}^{(s - 1){\int}_0^t {\mathrm{d}\tau \rho _0(\tau )} }$$

Similarly the dynamic equation for the second moment becomes \(\frac{{\partial M^{\left( 2 \right)}(t)}}{{\partial t}} = M^{\left( 1 \right)}\left( t \right) + (s - 1)\rho _0M^{\left( 2 \right)}(t)\) and we find

$$M^{\left( 2 \right)}\left( t \right) = tM^{\left( 1 \right)}(t)$$

Initially the first moment increases exponentially. However with increasing mean copy number the rate of cells transitioning into a state without ecDNA is decreasing and the increase of the mean ecDNA copy number slowly levels off. Note for s = 1 we recovered the previous results for the moments of neutral ecDNA amplifications.

Genome editing using CRISPR–Cas9 ribonucleoprotein

Genome editing in COLO320-DM cells was performed using Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (catalog no. 1081058; IDT) complexed with sgRNA (Synthego) according to the Synthego RNP transfection protocol using the Neon Transfection System (catalog no. MPK5000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly 10 pmol Cas9 protein and 60 pmol sgRNA for each 10 μl reaction were incubated in Neon Buffer R for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1× PBS resuspended in Buffer R and 200000 cells were mixed with for the preincubated RNP complex for each 10-μl reaction. The cell mixture was electroporated according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the following settings: 1700 V 20 ms 1 pulse. Cells were cultured for 10 d afterwards; cell counts and ecDNA copy number data were collected at days 3 6 and 10. To estimate the ecDNA copy numbers we performed metaphase chromosome spreading followed by FISH as described above. All sgRNA sequences are in Supplementary Table 3.

FISH probes

The following probes were used for FISH as indicated: ZytoLight SPEC CDK4/CEN 12 Dual Color Probe (ZytoVision); ZytoLight SPEC MYCN/2q11 Dual Color Probe (ZytoVision); Empire Genomics EGFR FISH Probe; Empire Genomics MYC FISH Probe; Empire Genomics FGFR2 FISH Probe; Empire Genomics CDK4 FISH Probe; Empire Genomics MYCN FISH Probe.

Antibodies

The following antibodies were used at concentrations of 1:100–1:200 for immunofluorescence and 1:1000 for immunoblotting (unless otherwise indicated in specific Methods sections): Aurora B Polyclonal Antibody (catalog no. A300-431A; Thermo Fisher Scientific); EGFRvIII monoclonal antibody 806 (ref. 36); anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488.

Statistics and reproducibility

Sample sizes for the biological experiments analyzing copy number distributions were informed by stochastic simulations. Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups.

Besides being a grooming requirement essential for keeping your breath fresh research has also shown that it can have a significant impact on your long-term health as well. In most cases the only harm that can come from picking up your toothbrush is the result of doing something wrong during the twice-a-day cleaning ritual. But now the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that anyone with certain Colgate toothpastes should get rid of them immediately. Read on to see why the health agency has issued a recall for the dental hygiene products.

Some product recalls can be tied to specific stores.

Companies issue product recalls whenever they discover a potential risk to consumers. And in some cases items carried primarily or exclusively by certain retailers can be at the center of such safety alerts with a few notable recent examples.

In early August the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced that hardware company DeWalt had issued a recall on 1.4 million of its 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws sold at Lowe's and Home Depot. The affected model numbers included DWS779 DWS780 and DHS790 Miter Saws with the date codes 2019 04 through 2022 04. The company issued the recall after it discovered the tool's rear safety guard can break or detach allowing projectiles to ""strike the user and bystanders.""

On Sept. 1 the CPSC announced that TJX Companies had issued a recall of a Novogratz brand Outdoor Metal Hanging Chair sold at its HomeGoods and Homesense stores as well as at HomeGoods/T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods/Marshalls combination stores. After selling 5000 units nationwide the company pulled the product from shelves after 16 injuries were reported due to the furniture tipping or falling over while being used.

And in July the FDA announced that over 430 toiletries hygiene and over-the-counter (OTC) medication products sold at Familly Dollar were subject to a widespread recall. According to the notice the discount retailer found that the items had been ""stored outside of labeled temperature requirements."" Now another retail-specific recall has been issued.

The FDA has issued a recall for certain Colgate toothpastes sold at one major retailer.

On Sept. 16 the FDA announced that Family Dollar had issued a voluntary recall of Colgate products it sells including toothpastes and mouthwash. The items in question were shipped to stores in Arizona California Georgia Idaho Indiana Montana New Mexico Nevada Oregon Texas and Utah from approximately May 1 2022 through June 21 2022.

The recalled products include Colgate Optic White Stain Prevention Toothpaste 2.1-ounce with UPC 998277; Colgate Optic White Charcoal Toothpaste 4.2-ounce with UPC 998909; Colgate Optic White High Impact Toothpaste 3-ounce with UPC 999088; Colgate Optic White Toothpaste Icy Fresh 3.2-ounce with UPC 999749; Colgate Optic White Stain Fighter Toothpaste Clean Mint 4.2-ounce with UPC 999750; and Colgate Optic White Mouthwash 16 fl. oz. with UPC 999043.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

The store recalled the products due to a safety hazard created by storage issues.

Like the previous recall Family Dollar pulled the affected Colgate products after discovering the items had been ""stored outside of labeled temperature requirements"" according to the FDA's notice. While the company did not provide a list of specific stores that carried the recalled products it said it had notified locations and asked them to ""check their stock immediately and to quarantine and discontinue the sale of any affected product.""

Here's what you should do if you purchased any of the recalled Colgate toothpastes or mouthwash from Family Dollar.

The FDA reports that no illnesses related to the recalled products have been reported so far. However the agency advises anyone who thinks they may have experienced health problems to contact their healthcare provider or doctor immediately.

The agency states that customers who purchased the items can return them to Family Dollar where they were purchased even if they are not accompanied by a receipt. Anyone with questions or concerns can also contact Family Dollar by calling the customer service number listed on the agency's notice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9vbGQtYnJpZGdlLW5qLXdvbWFuLWZvdW5kLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1vd24taG9tZS1wcm9zZWN1dG9yLXNheXMtZGVib3JhaC1zb25uaS1icm93bi1oZXB3b3J0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Bridge NJ woman found killed in home months after husband's death,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9vbGQtYnJpZGdlLW5qLXdvbWFuLWZvdW5kLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1vd24taG9tZS1wcm9zZWN1dG9yLXNheXMtZGVib3JhaC1zb25uaS1icm93bi1oZXB3b3J0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239516A1C30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Images and B-roll from the month of volunteering with RIF are available HERE .

SEATTLE and WASHINGTON Sept. 19 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With September marking National Literacy Month Amazon and Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) announced today the culmination of their partnership to support student literacy. As part of Amazon's Global Month of Volunteering  Amazon's work includes providing youth with resources to drive more reading engagement opportunities. Through specialized literacy kits and various reading activities the program served over 27000 children nationally to inspire the next generation of lifelong readers in underserved and underrepresented communities.

Reading Is Fundamental and Amazon partners to support literacy.

As the nation's oldest and largest non-profit children's literacy organization Reading Is Fundamental has a long history of partnering with organizations to ensure that kids of all backgrounds have access to books and literacy resources. This year RIF joined Amazon as one of the partners in the company's month-long initiative dedicated to positively impacting the communities where Amazon employees live and work. From August 15 through September 15 Amazon volunteers supported RIF's commitment to ensure all children have the equal opportunity to read and succeed.

""Amplifying literacy within Amazon's Global Month of Volunteering has shown tremendous impact in communities across the country. While children directly received diverse books focused on the theme of courage we also demonstrated the importance of community involvement in driving reading engagement"" said Alicia Levi President and CEO of Reading Is Fundamental. ""Equipping Amazon's team members with opportunities to connect around driving literacy has been incredibly rewarding for students families teachers and volunteers alike!""

Thousands of Amazon employees volunteered for one of three RIF program opportunities to drive reading engagement including:

Book Celebration Events: Through RIF's flagship 'Books for Ownership' program— where children choose books they want to take home— employees in four cities including Atlanta  Detroit  Baltimore and Phoenix  helped with event set-up supported children with book selections and reading activities and offered read-alouds.

Book Talks: Amazon employees chose from a list of books to film a book talk - sharing with students why they love a book and how it inspired them. All book talk videos with the chosen book recommendation are available for viewing on RIF's free resource website Literacy Central.

""This partnership with RIF underscores Amazon's commitment to inspiring the next generation of lifelong readers by reducing barriers to learning where our employees work and live"" said Jessica Margarit Amazon's Head of Operations Community Engagement Americas. ""Through the RIF program we're excited to engage communities to emphasize the importance of equitable access to education and reading for children no matter the culture race or background.""

For Gabriella Santos an Amazon employee in Maryland joining colleagues across the U.S. to support RIF's programs during Amazon's Global Month of Volunteering was personal. Her love for reading was ignited during monthly visits to a local bookstore in her Brazilian hometown.

""We would take a book home and treat it as a treasure to be explored and that could take us to so many places. I cherish those moments and can still remember the smell of those newly touched books with so many stories and characters popping out of them"" Santos said. ""Growing up reading became my path to writing to express myself and shape how I view the world. I see my books as resources to navigate different areas and times of my life and I hope that increasing the access of books to kids in Baltimore and across the country could serve as the same set of tools for their realities and future.""

A Chilkat robe such as the one currently on display at the Alaska Native Heritage Center typically takes a year to produce. It’s made from twine that’s hand-spun from mountain goat wool and yellow cedar bark.

Thanks to digitization a fragile Tlingit ceremonial garment is once again teaching traditional weaving techniques. Why you can trust us By Frank Hopper 7 MIN READ

It was not a pretty robe when it arrived at the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage last spring. The tassels were frayed and twisted the colors faded.

The Tlingit ceremonial garment called a Naaxein or Chilkat robe was born from the hands of a Tlingit weaver around the year 1900. The weaving is exquisitely complex and beautiful and very few examples of this technique remain. But its exile from Tlingit culture in the intervening century wrought heavily on its appearance. Now the robe is almost too fragile to pick up.

“Every time it’s flipped and moved little pieces of it come off because it’s in a pliable fragile state” explains museum curator Angie Demma.

Worst of all the robe hasn’t been worn danced in or loved by Alaska Native people in more than 120 years. Nor has it been able to pass on its knowledge of traditional weaving techniques. At least not until this past spring.

The History of Chilkat Robes

Chilkat robes are signs of wealth and status. It takes at least a year for a weaver to weave one. The twine made of mountain goat wool and yellow cedar bark is hand-spun on the weaver’s thigh a few yards per day. Some estimates say it takes 500 hours to spin the twine and 2500 hours to weave the robe.

The robes are traditionally worn at important tribal gatherings such as the koo.eex commonly called the potlatch. Only certain people with permission can wear the robes and only under very specific circumstances.

The wearer usually dances with the robe draped down the back and over the shoulders in front. Dancing and spinning in circles causes the fringe to rise like wings soaring. This visual in combination with powerful drumming and singing leave a deep impression on those who witness it.

The robes are much more than decoration however. Their origins have roots in tales of the trickster Raven and the sea spirit Gonaqadet. The garments are so powerful in one tale told by Tlingit elder and anthropologist Louis Shotridge (and written down for the Penn Museum in 1914) a Chilkat robe caused a war between the Tsimshian and Haida tribes.

Shotridge tells of a Tsimshian Chief who shows a beautiful robe to a Tlingit trader. The trader becomes entranced by it and offers an exorbitant sum for the robe. The Chief accepts the price on the condition the trader also includes a special royal delicacy called tínx made from a special sweet berry found only in the north a supply of which the trader has with him. The trader hesitates because the tínx he has with him is meant for a rival Chief of the Haida tribe in the south. But the trader is so entranced by the robe he finally agrees and gives the payment and the Haida Chief’s tínx to the Tsimshian Chief.

When the Haida Chief hears his tínx has been usurped by the Tsimshian Chief he takes it as an insult and a bloody war between the two tribes which had been brewing for some time erupts.

The Tlingit trader takes the robe he bought to his home in the Chilkat region but because of its connection to the war he refuses to show it to anyone. He even attempts to destroy it. But his daughter goes into seclusion for more than a year to study the robe and learn the secrets of its beauty. She then uses these techniques to weave a new even more resplendent robe.

Years later the Tlingit trader’s clan ends a war with a rival clan and as a symbol of the covenant of absolute peace between them he reveals the new radiant robe his daughter has woven.

“There was shone forth like the rays of the rising sun a like creation which the people had never viewed” Shotridge writes.

The new robe is called Rain Storm because it clears all foul matter out of the way to prepare for the coming of peace. Robes are still presented at the koo.eex of many families and clans. They are worn at memorials totem pole raisings and many other occasions such as Sealaska Heritage Institute’s Celebration held every two years in Juneau. Thus the connection between Chilkat robes and Tlingit ceremonies continues.

The Bond Between Robes and Humans

“[Chilkat robes] were considered to be part of the family” says Tlingit weaver Shelly S’eiskaa Laws. “Once you weave a robe and once it comes off the loom it kind of takes on a life of its own. … It accumulates its own experiences and stories.”

“Important robes are brought to potlatches even if they aren’t worn” Laws says. “They’re considered relatives or guests.”

According to Lily Hope a Tlingit Chilkat weaver teacher and lecturer only about 12 people currently exist who have woven a Chilkat ceremonial dancing robe. She says this is mainly due to the tremendous amount of time it takes to complete one.

Chilkat weavers spend months repeating the same movements over and over for hours at a time. This concentration required can be compared to meditation and weavers often speak fondly of the bond they form with the robes they weave.

“Each robe has its own personality. Each one has a different vibe” Hope said while giving a weaving demonstration at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle.

Hope a Raven of the T’akDein Taan clan comes from a family of weavers. Her mother the late Clarissa Rizal was instrumental in helping revive the tradition after becoming a student of Jennie Thlunaut an elder in the tradition and a famous prolific Chilkat weaver.

“Our mother used to talk about how a certain robe made her happy when she wove it and how another one made her cry” she says. “Weaving a robe is almost like raising a child as you let the robe’s natural qualities come out and you simply encourage that development.”

Hope’s sister and fellow Tlingit weaver Ursala Hudson says she only began weaving a few years ago after her mother coaxed her into weaving a 5-inch square block for a larger robe. Hudson discovered she loved weaving and began seriously studying it.

Hudson’s mother “walked into the forest” as Tlingits say in 2016 and Hudson used weaving to feel closer to her. She wove an entire Chilkat robe during the pandemic. As she wove she became aware of how her fingers moved the same way her mother’s had the same way her people’s had for hundreds of years.

“You realize when you’re in that moment that you are part of this really long thread” Hudson says. “You’re just continuing the work of your ancestors. … Your work is a manifestation of your ancestors.”

Scanning the Robe

The “teaching” robe at the Alaska Native Heritage Center was originally given to a mining executive in Juneau around 1900. When the mining industry there declined he and his family moved to California and took the robe with them. It was in storage for decades until several years ago when the robe was given to an old family friend and doctor working in Alaska Brian Trimble who finally helped the robe make its way back into Alaska Native hands.

Trimble donated the robe to the Heritage Center refusing to accept anything for it though it’s probably worth tens of thousands of dollars.

The Alaska Native Heritage Center cleaned the robe and on May 2 honored its return with song and dance. Tribal members from the dance group Aachich Kwaan danced for the robe in regalia. Alaska Native students surrounded the robe and gazed at it respectfully.

Tlingit weaver Shelly S’eiskaa Laws spoke about the robe and explained its curious markings. The design was of a diving whale she said which was hard to see until Laws pointed out its various parts.

Most Chilkat robes use consistent weaving techniques but this one used many different styles. The unknown Tlingit woman who wove it used the robe to demonstrate different weaving techniques to a student. Looking closely at it one can almost hear the weaver saying to her student “Here’s another way you can do it.”

It is impossible to tell what Tlingit clan and house the robe belongs to Laws told the students. The design is relatively common and the weaver’s mark could be misleading as students often used their teacher’s signature mark as an indication of lineage.

Following the welcome ceremony a technology company called Trimble Inc. (no relation to the robe’s donor) brought LIDAR scanners to the center to digitize the robe. The resulting 3D image files they donated have such high definition that the robe can be zoomed in on and turned over and around allowing examination in minute detail. So while the actual elder robe now lies comfortably in a protected case new generations of Chilkat weavers can learn from it in digital form.

The robe scanning was just one part of a multiday event in which other things such as Iñupiaq gloves were scanned and digitized in partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program. Drones were also used to scan traditional Alaska Native houses on the museum grounds. Young Alaska Native high school students from various tribes in the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program attended as part of a visiting professionals program sponsored by the scanning company Trimble Inc. which connects technology professionals with the classroom.

The Chilkat robe scanning was the highlight of the event.

The Rise of Virtual Reality in Indian Country

Other tribes and Native organizations also use laser scanning and digital imagery to enhance preservation of tribal artifacts and provide tools for invigorating the study of tribal culture. The Virtual Museum of Native American Basketry has more than 100 3D virtual images of Native American baskets anyone can “virtually” pick up turn over and otherwise examine online.

In California several sacred caves of the Tejon Indian Tribe were laser scanned in 2017. Tribal members and others can now enter a virtual reality model of these caves and examine the rock art without damaging the actual sites which are off-limits to visitors.

The video game Never Alone uses 3D scanned images of actual Iñupiaq objects. The player experiences an authentic Iñupiaq story by playing a young Iñupiaq girl on a quest to find the source of an eternal blizzard threatening her people.

The old Chilkat teaching robe is now back with its Tlingit and Alaska Native families. Revered as an elder the robe has accumulated its own stories and experiences as it traveled. Like so many Alaska Native people the robe was displaced from its ancestral home but eventually returned and was welcomed.

Now in its old age and thanks to digital technologies the Chilkat robe teaches again.

U.S. Bancorp PNC and Truist – along with Bank of America Citi JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo – play an outsized role in our financial system and economy. They serve hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses and have assets of $13 trillion that represent over 50 percent of the nation’s GDP.

While the nation’s largest banks rake in huge profits they have continued to fail their customers and workers. Banks bring in billions of overdraft fees from customers put their wealthy Wall Street clients over Main Street small businesses and consumers for PPP loans during the pandemic and fail to help customers whose money is stolen on Zelle – a payments network owned by seven banks including Bank of America JP Morgan Chase PNC Truist U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

The snapshots follow dozens of reports of consumer abuse from large financial institutions nationwide. On Thursday the banks’ CEOs will testify at the Committee’s annual bank oversight hearing.

The snapshot on PNC can be found here.

The snapshot on U.S. Bancorp can be found here.

The snapshot on Truist can be found here.

The Committee will release snapshots for the other testifying banks later this week in the leadup to the hearing.

For years Senate Democrats have pressed the biggest banks to do right by their customers and they will continue to fight for the working Americans and small businesses that make our economy work. More information about their work can be found here.

Example video title will go here for this video

ATLANTA — The Atlanta Braves are heading to the White House next week.

President Joe Biden invited the World Series champions to Washington D.C. on Sept. 26 at 11:30 a.m. to celebrate their first title since 1995.

The Braves beat the Houston Astros last year. It is tradition for sports teams to visit the White House after winning championships.

The 2021 postseason was not expected to finish the way it did - not for these Braves who only won 88 games and were without arguably their best player Ronald Acuña after his injury.

The team however despite their less-than-sterling resume had something else that made them special beyond just wins and stats - they had a team spirit and a gritty resolve that showed up time and time again.

They beat the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLDS a quality opponent and then overcame the heavily-favored defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.

And then in the World Series they beat the Houston Astros in six games to win their first pennant in 26 years.

It is unclear if any players from that team no longer on the Braves will be in attendance at the White House visit. Freddie Freeman and the Dodgers however also have an off day on the 26th.

Now this year's Braves team hopes to make it back-to-back trips to the White House. We'll wait and see."

NEW YORK Sept. 19 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With the United States welcoming tens of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan Ukraine and other crises today dozens of America's largest employers and best-known brands are announcing new commitments to hire 22725 refugees in full time positions in the U.S. helping to advance the economic and social integration of refugees across the country. This is the most significant set of business commitments in support of refugees on record.

The U.S. Business Summit on Refugees organized by the Tent Partnership for Refugees (Tent) — a network of 260 major businesses committed to supporting the economic integration of refugees — brings together leading companies including Amazon Hilton PepsiCo Pfizer and Tyson Foods to announce commitments to hire and train thousands of refugees in the United States over the next three years. The Summit is the first in a series of milestones to continue to mobilize companies in support of refugees.

""The American business community is showing incredible leadership and I am so proud of the companies standing up for refugees today"" said Hamdi Ulukaya CEO of Chobani and founder of Tent. ""These companies will benefit from welcoming these hard-working loyal and resilient individuals – but my hope is that this is only the beginning. As refugee crises start to fade from the headlines companies must recognize that hiring refugees is not only the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do.""

The United States is set to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees in the coming years including almost 100000 Afghans by the end of 2022 100000 Ukrainians who have fled Russia's invasion and up to 125000 refugees per year from other parts of the world who will arrive through the resettlement program. As refugees in the U.S. often face significant challenges finding work – including language barriers difficulty certifying their credentials and lack of a professional network – business leadership is critical to help refugees secure jobs.

Among the commitments companies are announcing today:

Amazon will hire at least 5000 refugees over three years

will hire at least 5000 refugees over three years ManpowerGroup will place 3000 refugees in jobs at its corporate clients over three years

The move will result in hundreds of high-paying white-collar jobs moving from metro Sioux City to northwest Arkansas.

The Dakota Dunes offices are now home to Tyson's fresh meats division. The sprawling complex in the upscale planned community in southeast South Dakota was built as the world headquarters for IBP inc. which was acquired by Tyson in October 2001 for $3.2 billion creating the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken beef and pork.

In addition to Dakota Dunes Tyson on Wednesday said staff at two other Tyson offices -- in Chicago and Downers Grove Ill. -- also will be moving to the company headquarters in Springdale.

The relocations completed in phases will begin in early 2023.

Tyson said the move will ""foster closer collaboration enhance team member agility and enable faster decision making positioning Tyson to win with its team members customers and consumers.""

“Tyson’s diverse portfolio of products and brands provides us with an unmatched strategic advantage to serve our customers” Tyson President a nd CEO Donnie King said in a statement. “Bringing our talented corporate team members and businesses together under one roof unlocks greater opportunities to share perspectives and ideas while also enabling us to act quickly to solve problems and provide the innovative products solutions that our customers deserve and value.”

Tyson will continue to operate its flagship beef plant across the river in Dakota City Nebraska and cold storage operations in Sioux City. Tyson employs about 4500 people in the metro area -- mostly in Dakota City -- making it by far the area's largest employer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvc3RyYW5nZS9iZXlvbmQtbWVhdC1jb28tYXJyZXN0ZWQtZm9yLWJpdGluZy1tYW5zLW5vc2Uv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c25hdGlvbm5vdy5jb20vdXMtbmV3cy9zdHJhbmdlL2JleW9uZC1tZWF0LWNvby1hcnJlc3RlZC1mb3ItYml0aW5nLW1hbnMtbm9zZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beyond Meat COO arrested for biting man’s nose,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvc3RyYW5nZS9iZXlvbmQtbWVhdC1jb28tYXJyZXN0ZWQtZm9yLWJpdGluZy1tYW5zLW5vc2Uv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c25hdGlvbm5vdy5jb20vdXMtbmV3cy9zdHJhbmdlL2JleW9uZC1tZWF0LWNvby1hcnJlc3RlZC1mb3ItYml0aW5nLW1hbnMtbm9zZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950F9D840>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Merchants Bancorp was the lone depository institution to climb above the key asset mark which can bring increased regulatory scrutiny and it was not the company's first time crossing it.

The Carmel Ind.-based bank first surpassed $10 billion in the third quarter of 2021 and remained above the threshold through the fourth quarter of 2021 but its total assets dropped to $9.65 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The company crossed the mark again when it posted $11.09 billion in total assets at the end of the second quarter up 14.9% from the prior quarter.

Deals set to push more banks above benchmark

Another three U.S. banks are set to soon cross the threshold as a result of M&A: Houston-based Allegiance Bancshares Inc.; Indiana Pa.-based First Commonwealth Financial Corp.; and Boston-based Brookline Bancorp Inc.

Allegiance Bancshares is the smallest of those three with just $6.73 billion in assets in the second quarter. But it will nearly double its size after its merger of equals with Beaumont Tex.-based CBTX Inc. closes.

Crossing $10 billion in total assets brings growing pains for community banks in the form of lost income as the Durbin amendment kicks in and limits interchange fee income and increased expenses due to more regulation. As such many banks opt to leap past the threshold with an acquisition that can add economies of scale to help mitigate the headwinds.

""For several years now as we approach the $10 billion asset threshold we've been asked how we intended to cross. And our answer was consistent with what most $9 billion banks would say"" First Commonwealth President and CEO Thomas Price said on an Aug. 31 call to discuss the company's planned acquisition of Harrisburg Pa.-based Centric Financial Corp. ""We're prepared to cross organically but we'd prefer to cross the acquisition because of the significant loss of interchange income due to the Durbin amendment.""

Approaching the threshold

Eight community banks reported more than $9 billion in total assets in the quarter putting them right below the $10 billion mark. Park National Corp. was closest to the line with $9.83 billion in total assets at June 30.

HomeStreet Inc.'s total assets grew by 14.3% quarter over quarter leading one equity analyst to ask when the company expects to pass the threshold.

""It's possible we could break $10 billion in 2024. It could be earlier in the year it could be later in the year again depending on growth rates. That's what we are currently anticipating"" HomeStreet President and CEO Mark Mason said on a second-quarter earnings call.

Though the company had just $8.59 billion in total assets at June 30 it began preparing to cross $10 billion four years ago the executive said. The potential loss of interchange revenues is ""not that high"" for HomeStreet according to Mason and the company has the infrastructure in place to deal with vaulting over the benchmark.

""We were preparing to go over $10 billion about four years ago and we addressed many of the expectations of a $10 billion risk management system back then"" Mason said. ""And so we don't feel we have that much work to do. But we're dusting off our analysis and doing a gap analysis in order to prepare for it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5icm93bi5zZW5hdGUuZ292L25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzL3JlbGVhc2UvYWhlYWQtb2YtYmlnLWJhbmstaGVhcmluZy1iYW5raW5nLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1yZWxlYXNlLXNuYXBzaG90cy1vbi1wbmMtdHJ1aXN0LXVzLWJhbmNvcnDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ahead of Big Bank Hearing Banking Democrats Release Snapshots on PNC Truist U.S. Bancorp,"WASHINGTON D.C. — Today the Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs released snapshots highlighting the consumer abuses of three of the nation’s largest regional banks U.S. Bancorp PNC and Truist.

U.S. Bancorp PNC and Truist – along with Bank of America Citi JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo – play an outsized role in our financial system and economy. They serve hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses and have assets of $13 trillion that represent over 50 percent of the nation’s GDP.

While the nation’s largest banks rake in huge profits they have continued to fail their customers and workers. Banks bring in billions of overdraft fees from customers put their wealthy Wall Street clients over Main Street small businesses and consumers for PPP loans during the pandemic and fail to help customers whose money is stolen on Zelle – a payments network owned by seven banks including Bank of America JP Morgan Chase PNC Truist U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

The snapshots follow dozens of reports of consumer abuse from large financial institutions nationwide. On Thursday the banks’ CEOs will testify at the Committee’s annual bank oversight hearing.

The snapshot on PNC can be found here.

The snapshot on U.S. Bancorp can be found here.

The snapshot on Truist can be found here.

The Committee will release snapshots for the other testifying banks later this week in the leadup to the hearing.

For years Senate Democrats have pressed the biggest banks to do right by their customers and they will continue to fight for the working Americans and small businesses that make our economy work. More information about their work can be found here.

The quarter-century remaking of North Little Rock’s downtown riverfront rolled on last week as demolition started on the timeworn Greyhound bus depot a block south of City Hall.

The tear-down on Washington Avenue will clear the way for a new five-story hotel and set the stage for developing the empty block just west of Simmons Bank Arena.

A memorandum of understanding with investors including Nabholz Properties of Conway calls for building mixed-use developments along Broadway and Washington next door to the arena which set off downtown’s revitalization with its construction and eventual opening in 1999.

Dickey-Stephens Park four blocks to the west opened eight years later and by that time Main Street had begun its transformation from what former Mayor Joe Smith called “kind of a scary place” into a dining and entertainment hub and a lure for companies like First Orion Corp. and Taggart Architects which moved there. A $5.3 million public gathering space Argenta Plaza a park with water features swings a stage and dramatic lighting opened in fall 2020 at Main and Sixth streets.

Also on the city’s current drawing board west of the arena: a parking deck surrounded by shops offices and apartments paired with a 40000-SF conference center on land between Main and Poplar streets now occupied by North Little Rock Electric and the City Services Building. Those are set for eventual demolition.

Promenade Plans

Greg Nabholz CEO of Nabholz Properties is working with investors Scott Hilburn and Scott Landers to develop lots to the north and south of the 2nd Street Promenade the brick pedestrian path that leads west from the arena’s west entrance to Poplar Street and on to Main. The parking deck and conference center would be on either side of the promenade between Poplar and Main.

“There will be two buildings on each side of the promenade with an additional building fronting Broadway Street and one fronting Washington with parking in between” Nabholz said. Nabholz Properties’ Broadway Street LLC owns the parcel on Broadway just west of the arena having bought part of it as a partial investor some 15 years ago. Consolidating that property along with a parcel bought from the city cost about $1.1 million he said.

Argenta Entertainment Development Management LLC with Nabholz Properties Hilburn and Landers as prime investors has the city property south of the promenade under contract. Hilburn is an attorney at the Hilburn Law Firm at 1 Riverfront Place in Argenta the landmark bank building across Main from the City Services Building.

Both Broadway Street LLC and AEDM “are working with the city Pulaski County and Rock Region Metro to extend the Junction Bridge trail from where it emerges at Washington Avenue across both properties to Broadway Street along the west property line of the arena” Nabholz said.

By the end of the year he said a final plan will be ready for City Council consideration after tenants are lined up and investors have approved all details.“From there we’d get our permits” Nabholz said. “We’d like to start construction by July 2023.”

Investors must approve a contractor and architect but Nabholz said ideas for the north side of the promenade “include restaurant and entertainment with potential hospitality and residential uses above in a building envisioned as six to eight floors. The building on Broadway is likely to be one or two floors of retail and service businesses and the Washington Avenue structure is foreseen as two floors with dining and retail on the ground floor and residential or office units above.

“Once we have finalized the development plan and received approval from our investors we will present the plan to the North Little Rock City Council by the end of the year” Nabholz said. “Once the council approves the plan and we receive the necessary permits we will close on the property in early 2023 with construction to start by July.”

Revamped Landmark

Meanwhile across Main from the site of the planned conference center T.J. Lefler is showing off some $3 million in improvements to the former Twin City Bank and U.S. Bank building he has rechristened as 1 Riverfront Place. Lefler’s 1 Riverfront QOZB LLC bought the gleaming black 113650-SF landmark the tallest building on the north riverfront for $5.6 million a little over a year ago. Intense work followed inside and out Lefler said.

“We’ve put over $3 million into the renovations and we’re almost finished” Lefler said before offering a photographer a tour. “It’s a sort of iconic location in the middle of everything in Argenta and it’s a building of stature that we think is just going to be there forever.” The former Sage Partners executive said the building has all new glass remodeled common areas newly landscaped entrances and a redone parking lot.

“I’d say it is 95% occupied” he said. “U.S. Bank which sold it to us has renovated its space and signed a new lease.” Landers also an investor in the developments along the arena promenade owns Applied Technology Group which has taken up a chunk of the revamped bank building. “He’s a partner in our building and has spent between $1 million and $2 million on their two floors” Lefler said.

End of Line at Bus Station

Crews began work Tuesday demolishing the old bus terminal at 118 E. Washington Ave. part of a downcast stretch of Washington Street that includes pawnshops and the Arkansas College of Barbering & Hair Design a campus in the Arkansas Technical School system. Greyhound moved its terminal last year to Love’s Travel Stop on Interstate 40 in Galloway. The bus company said the move reflected a national trend of stations leaving downtown areas for the outskirts of cities.

The North Little Rock City Council voted in May to pay $650000 for the bus terminal property with Mayor Terry Hartwick saying that the ability to control development options downtown was well worth the price.

The new hotel site is a half-block west of the Junction Bridge cater-cornered from the building Nabholz Hilburn and Landers are developing. “The plan is to connect the bridge path to the arena and Broadway to the Inland Maritime Museum and trails along the river with Main Street Argenta and even to Dickey-Stephens Park to the west” Nabholz said.

Cost projections for the projects haven’t been finalized but the two-parcel four-building project is called 2nd Street Promenade on land bounded by the arena to the west Poplar Street to the East Broadway to the north and Washington Avenue to the south.

“We are working with H+N Architects out of Conway on the concept plans for the project and final decisions on the development team will be made by the AEDM LLC investors soon” Nabholz said.

Resort at Rockwater

Even west of the ballpark and the Broadway Bridge residential development is continuing following the lines of The Vue on Riverfront Metropolitan Apart-ments immediately south of the arena and Thrive Apartments on Fourth Street. Major apartment buildings like those as well as townhouse complexes like Argenta Flats along Maple Street are key elements in the city’s long-term mission of creating a downtown and riverfront where people can live work shop and play.

One goal for the mixed-use developments being planned now is landing a grocery store — if not a supermarket then at least a small mercantile like Stratton’s Market in downtown Little Rock.

Moses Tucker Partners of Little Rock announced Wednesday that it’s developing a $70 million upscale apartment complex to the west of The Vue the $36 million 250-unit complex that Moses Tucker developed with Terraforma and opened last year.

The complex on the east edge of the Rockwater community which introduced apartments and single-family homes to the riverside just west of Argenta will include 360 units and be known as The Resort at Rockwater. The project is a joint venture of Moses Tucker Terraforma LLC of Maumelle and Jim Jackson and Lisa Ferrell the developers of Rockwater.

Robert Birch North Little Rock’s director of development said years of planning have envisioned another hotel and conference center downtown. “Other than the Wyndham we don’t have another hotel in the area and we’re constantly having to send people across the river to have meeting space. These are major footholds for us as a city and obviously they kind of go hand in hand.”

He said Benton’s new 29000-SF conference center is constantly booked “and we miss out on those opportunities a lot.”

Researchers say the incident has highlighted the risks that can come from trusting too much in multifactor authentication (MFA) as well as unmanaged risk around cloud-service adoption.

In an update on Monday Uber laid out the attribution: ""We believe that this attacker (or attackers) are affiliated with a hacking group called Lapsus$ which has been increasingly active over the last year or so."" Uber's announcement pointed to other companies that had been targeted by the notorious gang via similar techniques including Cisco Microsoft Nvidia Okta and Samsung

Lapsus$ has attracted considerable attention in recent months for its brazen attacks on some of the world's largest and well-known companies. One well-known tactic that the group has been known to use is co-opt MFA-circumventing tools into its attack chain.

And indeed Uber on Monday said the attacker who breached its network last week had first obtained the VPN credentials of an external contractor likely by purchasing them on the Dark Web. The attacker then repeatedly tried to log in to the Uber account using the illegally obtained credentials prompting a two-factor login approval request each time.

After the contractor initially blocked those requests the attacker contacted the target on WhatsApp posing as tech support telling the person to accept the MFA prompt — thus allowing the attacker to log in.

""The Uber breach appears to be a result of an MFA fatigue attack also referred to as an MFA bombing attack"" says Duncan Greatwood CEO of Xage. ""It’s a technique in which hackers send multiple authentication approval requests to a secondary device like a mobile phone in hopes that a user unintentionally provides access or grows so frustrated that they eventually approve a request.""

Remediation Process Begins

Once in the attacker breached multiple internal systems and Uber is currently in the process of doing an impact analysis the company said: ""The attacker accessed several other employee accounts which ultimately gave the attacker elevated permissions to a number of tools including G-Suite and Slack.""

The company said the attacker does not appear to have made any changes to its codebase nor does he appear to have access to any customer or user data stored by cloud providers. The attacker did appear to have downloaded some internal Slack messages and accessed or downloaded an internal tool that Uber's finance team uses to manage invoices. Though the attacker also accessed a database of vulnerability disclosures in its platform submitted via external researchers through the HackerOne bug-bounty program all the bugs have been remediated Uber said.



Breach Shows MFA's Weaknesses

Greatwood describes MFA fatigue attacks as being a very effective tactic for breaching target organizations. He says his company has observed attackers typically sending frequent MFA requests in the middle of the night or sending less frequent requests over a few days.

""Either way in traditional MFA architectures all it takes is just one approved request for a hacker to access internal systems from which they can further infiltrate the target organization"" he says.

Uber's security practices are sure to come under scrutiny because of the breach. But the reality is that the company was the victim of practices that are common to many organizations researchers note.

Patrick Tiquet vice president of security and architecture at Keeper Security says the Uber attack highlights a fundamental misconception around MFA's strength as a method to secure access.

""Although MFA adds a critical second layer of security to your accounts the biggest misconception about MFA is that all forms are equally secure"" he says.

One example of how MFA can fail is SIM card porting aka SIM-swapping Tiquet notes. This is where attackers port a mobile number to a SIM card or device that they control to receive SMS messages or phone calls for the target number.

""Use of SMS text messages as MFA should be discouraged and never used as MFA for high-value assets"" Tiquet says. ""The use of an authenticator app security key or biometrics are stronger and more effective methods to protect your accounts.""

Security researcher Bill Demirkapi explains that another very common misconception is that standard forms of MFA — such as push touch and mobile — protect against social engineering. The reality is that MFA remains vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks he says.



He notes that best practices include using phishing- and MiTM-resistant forms of MFA rather than time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) not centralizing access keys and rotating keys regularly. On the latter point organizations also often do not limit access keys to the minimum privileges required for the key's intended purpose.



""Uber may not have followed best practices but many other companies don't either"" he says. ""The main point I'd like to drive home is the importance of not only investing into security for your organization but specifically investing into these best practices as well.""

It should be noted that the Uber breach is not the only high-profile hit in the last few days; the same Lapsus$ hacker who claimed responsibility in that incident (or at least someone using the same ""Teapot"" alias that the Uber hacker used) now appears to have also breached Take-Two Interactive's Rockstar Games posting videos of an early development copy of the Grand Theft Auto 6 video game. In a message the company acknowledged the breach and said it was ""extremely disappointed"" to have details of the game leaked in advance of its release.

Cloud Service Adoption Increases Risk

MFA is not the only weak link for many companies. At a higher level breaches like the one at Uber show the impact that rapid cloud services adoption and distributed work models are having on enterprise security strategies says Russell Spitler co-founder and CEO of Nudge Security.

The move to a more distributed model has increased enterprise reliance on asynchronous communications tools such as Slack and WhatsApp in business-critical environments he says. The rapid adoption of SaaS has created an unmanaged risk in the form of complex integrations between poorly managed services.

""The recent breach at Uber points to the fact that security orgs are outpaced by the sprawling complexity of modern distributed IT environments and sprawling digital supply chains"" Spitler notes. ""This complexity creates opportunities for even the most novice of threat actors to gain access using compromised credentials and [finding] their way to critical assets.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi91YmVyLXNheXMtaGFja2VyLXdvcmtpbmctd2l0aC1sYXBzdXMtcmVzcG9uc2libGUtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS1pbmNpZGVudC0yMDIyLTA5LTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber says Lapsus$-linked hacker responsible for breach,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi91YmVyLXNheXMtaGFja2VyLXdvcmtpbmctd2l0aC1sYXBzdXMtcmVzcG9uc2libGUtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS1pbmNpZGVudC0yMDIyLTA5LTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FA70A90>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The brand launches with the U.S.’ largest specialty beauty retailer digitally on Sunday and will go into 715 doors nationally on Oct. 16.

Despite the brand’s age — it only launched earlier this year — it has already hit $9 million in retail sales via its existing partnership with Target and is on track to hit $15 million for its first year there the brand confirmed to WWD.

Byoma is owned by Future Beauty Labs the parent company behind Tan-Luxe Tanologist and Isle of Paradise. The company’s founder and chief executive officer Marc Elrick told WWD it was born out of consumer insights.

“We’re a consumer-led business” he said of the brand’s inception. “During the pandemic we noticed internally and what we saw on social was the consumer over-exfoliating. With the rise of DermTok and a lot of conflicting information out there I felt like the consumer was more informed but maybe more confused.

“When we looked at the data insights as well as our own social media platforms we noticed it was a really big problem” he continued.

Social media’s role in the brand’s creation didn’t end there. The brand which houses its formulas in Gen Z-friendly vibrantly colored packaging has already gained 200000 social media followers. Its Moisturizing Gel Cream is the brand’s top seller given its TikTok virality status with 1.7 million views.

The brand’s offerings include a cleanser three serums the moisturizer and a hydrating trio kit. Each product incorporates a proprietary barrier-health complex with ceramides cholesterol and fatty acids at optimal ratios. Prices range from $12.99 to $24.99 and the full assortment will be available at Ulta.

As reported by WWD Ulta Beauty is winning with the Gen Z consumer. A Piper Sandler survey cited the retailer as the top retailer for the cohort nabbing 48 percent mindshare.

Though the brand plays well with younger consumers Elrick stressed that Byoma’s appeal spans demographics. “Every single person has a skin barrier and every single person can benefit from barrier care whether your barrier is compromised or not” he said. “We’ve noticed from the data we’re starting to get back from our retailers is that it’s appealing to a much broader demographic.” Byoma also over-indexes with Gen X.

“Our vision is to build the next CeraVe” Elrick continued. “With the demand we’ve had from retailers globally and the roadmap that we’ve built we will absolutely get there.”

The brand which recently expanded across European markets anticipates it will exceed between $300 million and $500 million in retail sales in the next three years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvdWx0YS1iZWF1dHktdGhlZnQtbWVub21vbmVlLWZhbGxzLXBvbGljZS0wOTE0MjAyMtIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvdWx0YS1iZWF1dHktdGhlZnQtbWVub21vbmVlLWZhbGxzLXBvbGljZS0wOTE0MjAyMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ulta Beauty theft; Menomonee Falls police seek to ID 2 individuals,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvdWx0YS1iZWF1dHktdGhlZnQtbWVub21vbmVlLWZhbGxzLXBvbGljZS0wOTE0MjAyMtIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvdWx0YS1iZWF1dHktdGhlZnQtbWVub21vbmVlLWZhbGxzLXBvbGljZS0wOTE0MjAyMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950C8A410>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Technology—AC traction Tier 3 or 4 prime-movers updated control systems real-time health monitoring—makes it all possible.

OEMs like Wabtec and Progress Rail (EMD/Caterpillar) now identify rebuilding locomotives to better-than-new status as their primary line of business. Companies such as NRE Knoxville Locomotive Works Brookville Equipment Cummins and Railserve LEAF also supply this market. And Class I railroad Norfolk Southern (NS) sometimes working in concert with Wabtec or Progress Rail but often independently rebuilds and repowers locomotives through its TMS (Thoroughbred Mechanical Services) division located in Altoona Pa. in the facilities of the former Pennsylvania Railroad’s legendary Juniata Locomotive Works.



This GP38CC switcher is EPA Tier 3-certified and delivers 2130 hp at 1800 rpm. Its Cummins QSK50 Tier 3 Power Module is designed for ease of installation into multiple locomotive models. Cummins pre-built the entire unit including the engine alternator airintake exhaust and air compressor drive on a base skid. New cooling cores were installed in the existing cooling hatch. The Power Module is equipped with a Kato dual-bearing traction alternator rated at 1600 kW of traction power and 288 kW of 120v/3-phase companion power. If required the alternator can be configured to meet the needs of a specific locomotive application.Cummins photo

Locomotives are a little like classic cars. Take good care of them and they’ll last many years decades even. But at some point they will need to be rebuilt if they are to continue in regular service. “Restored” is not the correct term here because restoration is meant for locomotives designated for occasional service on special excursions or static display as cosmetically accurate museum pieces. “Resto-mod” is a more accurate analogy. For a classic car it could be a 1969 Pontiac GTO rebuilt with a modern LS-series V-8 electronic fuel injection disc brakes rack and pinion steering five- or six-speed Tremec transmission with overdrive Hotchkis suspension electric radiator fans 17-inch wheels etc. etc.—something that’s better than as-built new looks fabulous and can be driven anywhere without worry.

For diesel-electric locomotives resto-mods are best exemplified by what railroads like Union Pacific (UP) NS and Canadian Pacific are doing in place of investing in new power that can cost upward of $3 million each. For roughly half that investment they can obtain rebuilt upgraded units that deliver reliability fuel efficiency environmental benefits and longevity.

UP in late July selected Wabtec to modernize 600 locomotives in a deal worth more than $1 billion. This is Wabtec’s third major power-upgrade order from UP since 2018 covering more than 1030 locomotives upon completion in 2025.

Wabtec will upgrade 525 of UP’s AC4400 and AC6000s as well as 75 Dash-9s in what it called “the largest investment in modernized locomotives in rail industry history.” They will feature the FDL Advantage engine upgrade and Modular Control Architecture a next-generation controls technology that is said to be applicable throughout Wabtec’s locomotive installed base. The modernizations will not only extend locomotive life but also provide such benefits as a fuel efficiency improvement of up to 18%; a more-than 80% increase in reliability; and a haulage ability increase of more than 55% according to Wabtec. In addition Wabtec said each upgraded unit will eliminate approximately 350 tons of carbon per year and UP will realize approximately 210000 tons in annual emission reductions from the total modernization.

The work will take place at Wabtec’s U.S. plants with deliveries expected to begin in 2023. The manufacturer said 70000 tons of steel would be reused and recycled “which is the equivalent of more than 51000 passenger cars.”

For Wabtec the order is a bonanza. “We estimate that the agreement with UP could mean $360 million of revenue per year for Wabtec for the next three years” said Cowen and Company Transportation Analyst Matt Elkott. “At least 60% of that could be incremental to expectations resulting in incremental annual revenues of at least $216 million for 2023-2025 and annual incremental EPS accretion percentage in the high single digits to low teens. We note that modernizations are about half the revenue of a new locomotive for Wabtec but at much higher margins. As the North American new-build market is likely to continue to be anemic we expect modifications strength to continue with more Class I’s possibly signing new agreements. Wabtec is the largest freight locomotive builder followed by Caterpillar (Progress Rail/EMD). The two form an effective duopoly in North America.”

Like Wabtec Progress Rail has entered the repower market full-force offering four units: the EMD® 24B Repower T-4 30C 20B and 710ECO™. They all “can be tailored for customer installation” or delivered as “complete turnkey solutions using the latest generation of EMD® or Cat® engines and a choice of control systems.”

CRISI GRANTS POWER REBUILDS

The Federal Railroad Administration CRISI (Consolidated Rail Infrastructure & Safety Improvements) Grant Program has much wider applicability than infrastructure projects. Among several new eligible project categories is “rehabilitating remanufacturing procuring or overhauling locomotives

provided that such activities result in a significant reduction of emissions.” Eligible applicants now include “States a group of States an Interstate Compact a public agency or publicly chartered authority established by one or more States a political subdivision of a State Amtrak and other rail carriers providing intercity rail passenger transportation Class II/III railroads and associations that represent a Class II/III railroads (new) and rail carriers and equipment manufacturers in partnership with at least one of these entities.” For short lines regionals and S&T (switching and terminal) railroads expanded CRISI availability means that modern motive power is not out of reach.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why it matters: Conventional and electrically assisted cargo bikes are proving to be a good alternative. They take up less space reduce noise pollution and congestion – making city centers more livable and more pleasant places while saving around 57 tons of CO 2 per year in Hamburg alone not counting the benefits of relieving congestion.



How it works:

Parcels for a specific city center neighborhood are brought to a local ‘micro-depot’.

These depots can be a container small storage room or secured area on a parking deck.

UPS operators then use conventional and electrically assisted bicycles as well as walkers to make deliveries and pick-ups to and from the micro-depot.

The history behind it: In 2012 Hamburg became a model for parcel deliveries in more than 30 cities worldwide including Munich Frankfurt Paris Dublin London Portland and New York. The concept also works in smaller German cities like Paderborn and Westerstede.

One size doesn’t fit all: Every city is different so we adapt the concept to meet local requirements without compromising the reliability our customers expect of the UPS brand.

Rather the dual-degree UMD grad (BBA and BA '99) recalls a series of moments that have led to her current role as a business transactions lawyer in the Corporate Practice at Cozen O'Connor.

One moment came after she graduated from UMD. She moved from Minnesota to Oregon where she was working on her graduate degree at Willamette University. With the Oregon state capitol building quite literally across the street Willamette’s lunchroom was a popular spot for more than just students. “Justices from the Oregon Supreme Court would often come over to our campus cafe” said Gettman. “We would get to eat our lunch with legal greatness.” Gettman finished at Willamette with a master’s of business administration a law degree and a newfound career path.

UPS to UMD

Gettman called Minnesota home for the first eight years of her life. Her family moved frequently after that setting up shop in Texas and later California. “One of the things that moving taught me was resilience” she said. “As the new kid you learn really quickly how to meet people.”

By age 18 Gettman was back in Minnesota. In addition to taking night classes at the U of M she was working in the accounting department of United Parcel Services (UPS). Her job at UPS helped her develop a passion for the business world but after three years Gettman was ready for a change. She decided to enroll full-time as an undergrad at UMD. “I still remember driving over that hill for the first time. You see the lake and it's like seeing the ocean. It was just so beautiful.”

Gettman graduated from UMD in 1999 with two bachelor’s degrees; one in business administration and another in philosophy. Her schooling however was far from over. Willamette University in Salem Oregon came next.

Shifting Gears

When Gettman began at Willamette her plan was to enter the business world after graduation. She viewed law school as a supplement to her master’s in business administration. “I figured if I was going to work in business I should really understand the law that impacts it.”

But after four years at Willamette her plan had shifted. With two advanced degrees under her belt Gettman moved back to Minnesota with her husband and began studying for the bar.

The Legal World

Katie Gettman

Gettman’s passion for business has carried over into her career as an attorney. In the past 20 years she has served as in-house counsel a private practitioner a business founder and an entrepreneur in the Twin Cities area.

Today Gettman is an attorney with Cozen O’Connor. She works in the firm’s corporate practice where she provides legal counsel to companies executives and business owners. Often her work involves advising her clients on how to expand. “There is a lot of variety in my work” said Gettman but a lot of it is tied to client interaction. “I answer their questions as they come up and help them find solutions so they can grow their business.”

While Cozen’s office is in Minneapolis much of Gettman’s work can be done remotely. In 2020 she decided to return to the city where she spent her undergraduate years. She’s back in the Duluth area now.

A lot has changed since Gettman worked for UPS’s accounting department. One thing that hasn’t however is her passion for business. And now she gets to follow that passion surrounded by the splendor of Northeastern Minnesota.

Developer NewStreet Properties believes that the project over time will lure investment of up to $190 million.

The Gretna Logistics Park as the site is called is to kick off with construction of a 400000-square-foot warehouse. That structure will be a speculative build meaning tenants have yet to be secured.

Early plans also call for a second building that will stretch up to 300000 square feet and employ up to 200 workers. That employer is known but NewStreet declined to identify it yet as the sale of 25 acres for the assembly and production plant is still being finalized.

In all the broader development site could fit some 2 million square feet of industrial and warehouse building space for uses such as manufacturing and distribution said Peter Frei vice president of investments for NewStreet which bought the Sarpy County ground last year south of Interstate 80 off the Nebraska Crossing exit between Omaha and Lincoln.

The Gretna project signals continued strong demand for industrial projects that Frei believes will pick up in the region during the next five to 10 years. He said NewStreet wants to be ready when potential tenants come calling so as not to risk losing another business to a different city that has more move-in ready sites of that size.

“We think the tailwinds that the industrial market has been experiencing and that have been exacerbated by COVID will continue” he said.

‘A lot of dirt’

Construction on the first speculative warehouse will begin soon and likely be done in late 2023. NewStreet is so confident one or more users will come forth that they’re starting construction without any secured lease.

Frei said that there is a shortage of jumbo manufacturing and distribution spaces in the Omaha area and that suitable tracts of land on which to build them also are becoming scarcer.

Indeed much of the new and larger industrial space has sprouted nearer Sarpy County’s Papillion along or near Highways 50 and 370. But that growing area Frei said has become busier with traffic and area housing which is partly why NewStreet started looking for a development site near a different Interstate interchange.

His team found and bought the 170 acres of hilly farm ground near the open-air Nebraska Crossing mall. Land preparation was extensive he said requiring about one million cubic yards of dirt to be moved around to flatten the area.

“That’s a lot of dirt” he said.

All streets and utilities are to be installed by mid-2023. The developer created a sanitary improvement district to help fund public improvements.

The park is to be developed in two phases. The City of Gretna has approved necessary platting. The first building is to have a 36-foot height clearance and a cross docking feature that enhances speed flow and efficiency when dealing with certain inventories.

Boundaries are stretching

Dennis Sciscoe an industrial broker with the Cushman & Wakefield/Lund Co. is the listing agent and said the 400000-square-foot planned structure stands out as the area’s largest industrial-use property to be built on a speculative basis.

When all park phases are complete Sciscoe said the Gretna project would be the Omaha metro area’s largest contiguous industrial park.

“The boundaries of industrial development are pushing outward which is a good sign that our market is expanding” he said.

Other industrial parks are under construction in the metro area as well. R&R Realty of West Des Moines for example has been building a huge development in Sarpy County near Highways 370 and 50 that rivals the overall size envisioned at Gretna though the R&R property splits and is not contiguous.

Omaha developer White Lotus hopes to build about 1 million square feet of warehouse industrial space on 71 acres near Lincoln and also is developing the 138-acre I-80 Logistics Hub in Sarpy County at 132nd Street and Cornhusker Road.

A sample of tenants occupying I-80 Logistics: Amazon United Parcel Service Home Depot GXO Logistics Scooters.

The Opus Group plans to develop about 550000 square feet in Council Bluffs and said Sciscoe has leased a sizable chunk to Packaging Corp. of America.

The Omaha-Lincoln area offers attractive middle-America location and easy transportation access points Frei said. But he said he has known potential users who have flirted locally then turned elsewhere because of the shortage of readily available large spaces notably in the 300000- to 700000-square-foot range. Frei said the NewStreet project hopes to provide hefty industrial spaces for businesses seeking a relatively fast ramp-up for a project launch.

“There are users out there who need a home” Frei said. “We’re positioning ourselves to grow along with these tailwinds.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM1NzEzLWZlZGV4LXN0b2NrLXR1bWJsZXMtYWZ0ZXItd2FybmluZy1vbi1lY29ub21pYy10cmVuZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Stock Tumbles After Warning on Economic Trends,"FedEx’s warning of a sharp drop in package deliveries is rippling across the logistics sector and raising questions about the global economy. The Wall Street Journal reports that the delivery giant’s shares fell on Sept. 16 in the biggest one-day percentage drop since FedEx went public in 1978.

The impact pressured shares of rival operators including United Parcel Service XPO Logistics and Yellow in the U.S. and DHL owner Deutsche Post and Royal Mail in Europe. Shares of corrugated cardboard manufacturers International Paper Packaging Corp. of America and WestRock each fell at least 11%.

FedEx and UPS have been raising prices to offset the decline in package volumes as well as higher labor and fuel costs. Some shippers say they are struggling with the higher shipping fees amid ebbing demand and are turning to regional parcel carriers to bring their shipping costs down."

The 2022 Pharmaceutical Policy and Strategy provides an overall framework for governance regulation and programming within the health sector which has been lacking since 2006.

The Pharmaceutical Policy and Strategy was developed by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization to strengthen the pharmaceutical sector in South Sudan.

It lays the foundation for building systems for sustainable access to pharmaceuticals and related health technologies. It prioritizes the medium- to long-term goals and strategies set by the government for the pharmaceutical sector.

Access to medicines is a critical component of healthcare delivery system. Hence promoting sustainable and equitable access to medicines is the core mandate of the Ministry of Health.

In the WHO African Region it is estimated that about 58% of the population do not have access to medicines for non-communicable diseases.

In South Sudan access to essential medicines is a huge challenge. According to the 2018 Service Availability and Readiness Assessment Report only 14% of health facilities had the recommended medicines.

“Universal Health Coverage can’t be achieved without access to safe effective quality and affordable essential medicines” said Dr Victoria Anib Majur the Undersecretary at the Ministry of Health South Sudan. “It’s important to have a strong regulatory body to ensure that we are regulating the medicines coming to the country”.

As much as we develop strategies and policies implementation is more important. Dr Anib urged the Directorate to form a committee to implement the strategy. She acknowledged WHO’s continued support in developing policies and strategies for effective healthcare services.

“Access to medicines is a human right issue” said Dr Fabian Ndenzako WHO Representative a.i. in South Sudan. “Thanks to the generous contribution of the Canadian Government WHO supported the Ministry of Health to develop the pharmacy policy and strategic plan for South Sudan that promotes equity and sustainability of the pharmaceutical sector”.

WHO is committed to support the Ministry of Health to enhance access to medicines as part of the efforts to build resilient health systems and achieving Universal Health Coverage and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.

The Pharmacy Strategy is a 5 -year plan that is aligned with the Health Sector Strategic Plan.

The policy sets the standards for the safe modern practice of pharmacy in while building community confidence and providing high quality innovative services for patients that enhance patient care and public health.

Blistering crop-withering temperatures that also risk the health of agricultural workers could threaten swathes of global food production by 2045 as the world warms an industry analysis warned Thursday.

Climate change is already stoking heatwaves and other extreme weather events across the world with hot spells from India to Europe this year expected to hit crop yields.

Temperature spikes are causing mounting concern for health particularly for those working outside in sweltering conditions which is especially dangerous when humidity levels are high.

The latest assessment by risk company Verisk Maplecroft brings those two threats together to calculate that heat stress already poses an “extreme risk” to agriculture in 20 countries including agricultural giant India.

But the coming decades are expected to expand the threat to 64 nations by 2045 — representing 71 percent of current global food production — including major economies China India Brazil and the United States.

“With the rise in global temperatures and rise in global heat stress we’re going to see crops in more temperate countries as well start being affected by this” said Will Nichols head of climate and resilience at Verisk Maplecroft.

Rice is particularly at risk the assessment said with other crops like cocoa and even tomatoes also singled out as of concern.

– Growing risk –

Maplecroft’s new heat stress dataset using global temperature data from the UK Met Office feeds into its wider risk assessments of countries around the world.

It is based on a worst-case emissions scenario leading to around 2 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels as soon as 2045.

However the authors stress that in projections to mid-century even scenarios that assume higher levels of carbon-cutting action could still result in temperatures nearing 2C.

India — responsible for 12 percent of global food production in 2020 and heavily reliant on outdoor labour productivity — is already rated as at extreme risk the only major agricultural nation in that category at current temperatures.

“There’s a very real worry that people in rural areas which are obviously highly dependent on agriculture are going to be much more vulnerable to these kinds of heat events going forward” Nichols told AFP.

That could impact productivity and in turn exports — and have potentially “cascading” knock-on effects on issues such as the country’s credit rating and even political stability he said.

By 2045 the list grows much longer.

Nine of the top ten countries affected in 2045 are in Africa with the world’s second largest cocoa producer Ghana as well as Togo and Central African Republic receiving the worst possible risk score.

The top 20 at-risk countries in the coming decades include key Southeast Asian rice exporters Cambodia Thailand and Vietnam the authors said noting that rice farmers in central Vietnam have already taken to working at night to avoid the high temperatures.

The assessment highlights that major economies like the US and China could also see extreme risk to agriculture in 2045 although in these large countries the impacts vary by region.

Meanwhile Europe accounts for seven of the 10 countries set to see the largest increase in risk by 2045.

“I think what it reinforces is that even though a lot of us are sort of sitting in sort of Western countries where we might think we’re a bit more insulated from some of these threats actually we are not necessarily” Nichols said.

“Both in terms of the sort of physical risks that we’re facing but also in terms of the kind of knock on effects down the supply chain.” AFP",,,,,,,,,

Apple's latest flagship start at $799 for the base model iPhone 14 and $899 for the iPhone 14 Plus. You also have the $999 iPhone 14 Pro and $1099 iPhone 14 Pro Max to consider.

Luckily you can get yourself a free iPhone from Verizon —here's how.

Verizon takes $800 to $1000 off the new iPhone 14 series when you trade-in an eligible device. To qualify for this deal you must open a new line and activate your new iPhone 14 under a Verizon Unlimited plan.

If you receive the highest value for your trade-in you'd get the iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Pro for free. Or you could get the iPhone Plus or iPhone 14 Pro Max for just $99. This is one of the best iPhone 14 carrier deals out there.

And what's more if you switch from your existing carrier to Verizon you'll get a $200 eCard to cover any penalties you may incur.

Whether you plan to upgrade your phone or want to add a new line to your plan Verizon's iPhone deals will save you tons.

New York City launched Big Apple Connect bringing free internet to NYCHA residents in what is the nation's largest free municipal broadband program.

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- New York City launched ""Big Apple Connect"" on Monday bringing free high-speed internet to NYCHA residents in what is the nation's largest free municipal broadband program.

Mayor Eric Adams and Chief Technology Officer Matthew Fraser announced the citywide launch after a successful pilot program.

The landmark digital equity program will make free high-speed internet and basic cable TV available to approximately 300000 New Yorkers living in more than 200 NYCHA developments by the end of 2023.

The program was initially piloted at eight public housing developments across the five boroughs including at NYCHA's Langston Hughes Houses in Brownsville Brooklyn where officials made the announcement.

It has now been expanded to more than 100 developments.

Since the pilot's debut last month at Langston Hughes more than 200 existing customers of Optimum have been automatically converted and 120 new subscribers have been added.

Nearly 350 Langston Hughes units - or approximately two-thirds of households at the development - are already enrolled in Big Apple Connect.

""A 21st-century city like New York deserves 21st-century infrastructure and today we continue our quest to bridge the digital divide with the landmark rollout of Big Apple Connect"" Adams said. ""For too long lower-income communities immigrant communities and communities of color have been ignored when it comes to accessing the critical digital tools to help them succeed.""

Big Apple Connect will provide residents of NYCHA developments a free bundle that consists of in-home high-speed internet connection including a modem and router; basic cable TV service including a cable box and remote control; and common area Wi-Fi hotspots selected in consultation with NYCHA.

After requesting proposals earlier this year from existing New York City cable TV franchisees the city entered into three-year agreements with Altice (Optimum) and Charter (Spectrum) which will collectively cover the majority of developments owned and managed by NYCHA. The city is continuing to negotiate with Verizon as a possible third franchisee. OTI will be billed directly for all residents enrolled in 'Big Apple Connect' for the three-year term.

""Broadband is no longer a luxury but a necessity that all New Yorkers should have access to"" Adams said. ""That's why by the end of next year more than 200 NYCHA developments will have access to the free high-speed internet and cable TV giving approximately 300000 New Yorkers access to the essential tools to live productive lives. Something as simple as providing free accessible Wi-Fi can change the life of a New Yorker and Big Apple Connect will link our city to the future.""

NYCHA residents will not be billed anything for these services and existing customers of Optimum and Spectrum living in NYCHA developments where Big Apple Connect is active will be automatically enrolled in the program and will only be billed for additional services they choose to purchase directly.

Residents will receive email notifications and mailers explaining why their bills were lowered as well as information on Big Apple Connect.

Residents without existing service will have the opportunity to sign up directly though Spectrum or Optimum or may attend on-site enrollment events conducted by the companies in partnership with the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation.

An estimated 30-40% of NYCHA residents lack broadband according to cable service providers.

Once its rollout is complete Big Apple Connect is projected to be the largest municipal program to cover the cost of internet for public housing residents in the nation.

NYCHA residents enrolled in Big Apple Connect will also be able to use the federal Affordable Connectivity Program benefit to save money on their cell phone bills. The Affordable Connectivity Program provides a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet or cellular data service for eligible households and is limited to one monthly service discount per month.

In addition to the Langston Hughes Houses in Brooklyn the other pilot sites in the five boroughs included:

--Bronx: Mott Haven Houses

--Bronx: Patterson Houses

--Brooklyn: Brownsville Houses

--Manhattan: Polo Grounds Towers

--Queens: Queensbridge Houses

--Queens: Woodside Houses

--Staten Island: Stapleton Houses

Information about current and future eligible NYCHA sites will be available on OTI's Big Apple Connect website.

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year — her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website — the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page — so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being naïve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

Anchor and newsman Jon Erlichman said in a tweet that in the beginning 60000 credit cards were just mailed to unassuming residents in California in an attempt to get them to use the payment system. The experiment he said was called “the drop”.

“Visa was founded this day in 1958. It was an experiment called “the drop.” 60000 credit cards were mailed to unassuming residents in California. Overnight people had credit lines equivalent to $5000 today. They could buy things without going to the bank & pay it off later” he said in a tweet on September 18.

Visa began its journey with the Bank of America in 1958 when it launched the consumer credit card programme for middle-class consumers and small to medium-sexed merchants in the US. Bank of America launched the ‘BankAmericard’ a paper card with a limit of $300. In 1973 National BankAmericard that was incorporated in 1970 launched the first electronic authorisation system as well as an electronic clearing and settlement system.

The company expanded globally in 1974 and the debit card was introduced in 1975.

In 1976 BankAmericard was renamed Visa. In 1983 Visa launched the automatic teller machine (ATM) to provide cash 24x7 to clients across the world.

Visa issued its 1 billionth card in 2001. In 2008 the company – Visa Inc – went public in one of the largest IPOs in US history. In 2016 Visa completed the acquisition of Visa Europe.

Currently Visa operates in more than 200 countries with services available across devices.

They were involved in a romantic relationship behind the scenes.

Saved by the Bell was one of the defining TV shows of the ’90s. A sitcom that became popular thanks to its lighthearted teen storylines it also broached serious topics affecting young people. It ran for four seasons making celebrities out of actors Mark-Paul Gosselaar Mario Lopez Dustin Diamond and Elizabeth Berkley. What viewers couldn’t have known was that Gosselaar and Berkley were more than just co-stars. The two Saved by the Bell cast members were involved in a romantic relationship behind the scenes.

Saved by the Bell starred Gosselaar as Zack Morris a musically talented student also active in sports at his school. With his best friend Samuel “Screech” Powers Zach became one of the most popular characters on any TV program. Berkley portrayed Jessie Spano an outspoken straight-A student quick to stand up for women’s rights.

The young castmates worked closely while filming episodes of Saved by the Bell. And though four years isn’t an incredibly long time for a show to run on television Gosselaar and Berkley spent their formative years on the program. Ultimately it led the two young stars to form a romantic relationship one they hid from everyone else on set.

In 2019 Mark-Paul Gosselaar opened up about the secret romance saying it was inevitable that he and Berkley became romantically involved.

“When you’re working on a set and we were young there’s no one around really. I mean you work and live in a bubble” he revealed to Anna Faris on her podcast Anna Faris Is Unqualified.

Gosselaar noted that dating as a young actor was challenging because options were limited.

“You’re in your cars and you come to set and you do your work and you’re with these beautiful women and then you go back in your car” he explained. “And you’re not going to school so you don’t have a lot of choices.”

The actor admitted he also didn’t get out much partly because his mother drove him to the set every day.

In the end Gosselaar and Berkley ended their romance and later married other people.

According to IMDb Gosselaar has been married twice. His first marriage was to Lisa Ann Russell from 1996 until 2011. In 2012 following his divorce from Russell he married Catriona McGinn. The two are still together.

As for Berkley the actor married fellow performer Greg Lauren in 2003 and the couple remains happily married.

Gosselaar and Berkley weren’t the only Saved by the Bell cast members who dated while filming the beloved series.

In an interview producer Peter Enger revealed that “everybody dated everybody else except Screech” and that Tiffani Thiessen dated Gosselaar and Mario Lopez at different points throughout the show’s history.

In the end the behind-the-scenes romances didn’t seem to affect the friendships formed on Saved by the Bell. The cast and crew have reconnected for several Saved by the Bell reunions since the show went off the air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvMjAyMi8wOS8xOS9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1yb3VuZHVwLXNvY2Nlci1maWVsZC1ob2NrZXktZ29sZi1naXJscy12b2xsZXliYWxsLzEwNDI4OTE1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High school sports: Durfee Joseph Case field teams win at home,"The Herald News

Walton 36 is the founder and CEO of Builders Vision a Chicago-based family office that manages a total of $4 billion in Walton family assets through three branches: direct investing asset management and philanthropy. Today’s announcement will only affect the organization’s philanthropy arm the $1 billion Builders Initiative Foundation which supports programs related to food energy and oceans.

“If we are going to make lasting change happen we need our mission to show up in everything we do—especially in how we invest our resources” Lukas Walton said in a statement today.

The new strategy will still aim for a 5 percent annual return which is standard for tax-exempt endowments said Noelle Laing the chief investment officer of Builders Initiative.

Most private foundations allocate less than 20 percent of their endowment funds in ESG investments. Builder Vision’s 90 percent commitment sets a new benchmark for the industry.

I got chocolate-chip cookies from Kroger Safeway Walmart and Costco to review. Alana Al-Hatlani

As a professional baker I've probably made thousands of chocolate-chip cookies from scratch.

Chocolate-chip cookies were also one of the first things I learned to make as a kid and I've since spent a lot of time refining my own recipes for different versions of the classic from soft and chewy to crispy and lacy.

So of course I have strong opinions on what makes a good chocolate-chip cookie.

I don't like them overly sweet which typically happens when there's not enough bitter-but-balancing chocolate folded into the dough. Soft centers and crispy edges are ideal but there are certainly a lot of differing viewpoints on cookie texture.

Matthew Orloff:

Good day and welcome to Aviation Week's BCA podcast. I'm your host Matthew Orloff. And today we have someone very special with us. His name is Mark Malone who is a very accomplished corporate aviation pilot in his own right. However he does have a very special connection to one particular airplane. We'll just go ahead and call it Mickey Mouse One for now and I'll let him explain a little further as far as what that means if you couldn't figure it out already but Mark's father actually flew with Walt Disney. And I'll go ahead and let you take that story away if you don't mind Mark explaining the backstory of how you got involved with Disney Aviation what your connection is and to Walt's airplane which is now on display in Anaheim after the D23 convention right next to Disneyland. So Mark could you take it away?

Mark Malone:

Sure Matthew. Well my dad was Chuck Malone and in 1962 he started flying Walt Disney in a chartered twin engine Beech Travel Air Cessna 310 Aero Commander 500 locally around the Southwest Los Angeles area a lot of times out to Palm Springs sometimes down toward Disneyland. And Walt could see that there was a great use for general aviation to avoid the slow travel along the highways of the day. Remembering that back then there weren't the interstate highway system to the extent that we have it today.

Mark Malone:

So shortly after that Walt said ""Oh I want to get an airplane."" And they bought a 1963 Beechcraft Queen Air 65 put that into service for local flying. It ended up with the tail number of November 234MM. And the controllers went along with the pilots when they called in and said ""Hey Queen Air 234 Mickey Mouse climb to 3000.""

Mark Malone:

So it became an airplane that was recognized on the radio frequencies across the country. And later they decided that they needed a larger airplane to go to The New York World's Fair to promote Walt Disney Productions and they chose a Gulfstream which was a 1963 model. And at that point it was just a Gulfstream made by Grumman Aircraft. So they bought serial number 121 was put in service in 1964 and started making trips to LaGuardia to support the building of the 1964 '65 New York World's Fair where Disney showed Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln A Small World carousel progress and Skyway.

Mark Malone:

And at nine years old I started flying on the airplane on its very first flight which was a pilot training flight out of Burbank California. Got to ride on it for the next 15 years or so. And then in 1979 I started flying with my dad as pilot. Had a great career there and in 1985 the airplane was transferred to Florida. And at that point I didn't go with the airplane but it was an awesome opportunity to fly in Walt's airplane which was called Mickey Mouse One.

Matthew Orloff:

Just amazing. I'm sure you have a ton of remarkable memories that we'd all love to know more about but before I ask you that can you go into the specifics of Walt's airplane it's range and technical specs maybe how it relates to airplanes that are flying today? How long did it take to fly coast to coast? Could it even make it coast to coast at the time? To be honest I don't know.

Mark Malone:

Well Grumman decided to build the first purpose built business aircraft meaning it wasn't a converted airline or converted World War II airplane. So they chose a cabin that would hold between 10 and 19 passengers crew of three. It was powered by jet engines turning propellers. So it was a turbo prop. So it had reliability above and beyond the piston engine airplanes of its day. It was pressurized. So it could fly up to 30000 feet and it cruised at 350 miles an hour. And it was a transcontinental airplane with long range tanks. It had 10 hours of fuel on board. So it could easily make the run from Burbank to New York or Burbank to Orlando which was roughly 2000 miles. Usually they did it with 10 passengers crew of three roughly about six and a half hours down wind nonstop and then into the wind with a large load that you would have to stop once roughly eight hours in the air.

Matthew Orloff:

Wow. So you did mention that Walt himself was a fan of aviation. I think it goes hand in hand with the magic of Disney right? I don't care who you are flying is magical right? Even if nowadays people take it for granted. So it seems only right that someone like him would find it quite magical for lack of a better term. Did he have basically his own cockpit or instrumentation in his passenger seat? I remember seeing that on display at D23.

Mark Malone:

Well back when Grumman built the Gulfstream and then later the Gulfstream II all of those airplanes were delivered from the factory in a green configuration meaning they were primer painted on the outside no interior and only what they called flyaway avionics. So you had basic radios to fly day VFR. When you got to one of the handful of outfitters you chose the interior the paint scheme and the instruments up front. Every Gulfstream was different because the customers speced it out. So in this case the Walt Disney airplane was flown green to Burbank California. Pacific Airmotive Corporation was an outfitter that took Walt Disney's ideas and they made them into a custom interior that had 15 seats three couches two bathrooms fully functional galley with an oven and a cockpit up front with all-weather flight instruments. It had long range fuel tanks. So like I said it had 10 hours of fuel onboard at long range which would be flying at 29000 feet. The lower that you flew the more fuel you burnt and the lower range or lesser range you could get.

Matthew Orloff:

So really one of the first true business aviation uses for passengers on the very first business aviation aircraft would be used specifically for business.

Mark Malone:

So this airplane its claim to fame was a large cabin and long range. During the same basic timeframe the Learjet 23 came out and the Jetstar those airplanes due to engine technology were shorter range. They didn't have coast to coast capability. And for the most part you couldn't stand up in them. So Walt chose his airplane not for its top speed but for its long range because his projects required coast to coast transcontinental travel and he preferred to do it nonstop. He also liked the idea that it was a stand up cabin. He himself obviously was creative talent and he liked to fly with his Imagineers. Those are the people who thought up the rides they designed them. They figured out how to build them. Once they were built they tried to figure out how to operate them. So this wasn't a one-time event going back and forth. Gulfstream probably made over a hundred round trips back and forth in support of the New York World's Fair. And that was to show Walt Disney Productions to the world audience.

Mark Malone:

And that then put Disney on the map so that they could buy 27000 acres which ended up being the Florida project. And from that they got companies to help sponsor their development of The Magic Kingdom and Epcot and build out Walt's dreams. And all of it was made possible by the Gulfstream doing these trips where all the talent could be together creative on the airplane oftentimes with Walt and they were disconnected from the ground the interruptions of the office the latest emergency knock on the door something's got to be done. So in the airplane they could just brainstorm and got a lot done.

Matthew Orloff:

That's amazing. This airplane is responsible in huge part for building the Disney that so many people know and love today. And after seeing it on display at D23 I got to give you a ton of credit it looks gorgeous. And for those who don't know out there two things D23 is a convention they hold every year for lack of a better term for Disney fanatics which was very very fun to attend. Thank you Mark for getting me in. And Walt's plane was on display this year after being in Orlando since 1992 you said Mark. We got to give you some credit because you've really been responsible for restoring this airplane getting it back out to Anaheim for it to be on display for everybody to see and share with the world. Can you explain real quick the process and the amount of work you had to go through to make this happen and to bring it back and put it on display in the nice shape that it's in?

Mark Malone:

Well the airplane in 1992 was retired and its last flight was from Orlando Airport and it landed on Disney's World Drive which was just a highway going into the park there. And it was hoisted over into the back lot of the MGM Disney Studio. And from there it was put on display in the back lot tour I think for about 12 years. When the Star Wars Land was developed there was no longer room for the airplane so it was put into storage but not in a guest area.

Mark Malone:

And a couple years ago the company decided that it'd be nice to show Walt's airplane. And so they repainted it in Florida. Walt when he was alive had it tangerine orange black and white stripe. In Florida it was mainly blue and white and it had a big Mickey on the tail and it was used to promote the company on Goodwill flights up and down the east coast into the Midwest for most of its life actually.

Mark Malone:

So it was a big project to get the airplane prepared to move because it was no longer airworthy. So a team surveyed the airplane figured out it could be taken apart and four semi-trucks brought it out. The wing itself is a single piece. It's roughly 80 feet long and the fuse lodge was separated and the tail was separated and the props removed.

Mark Malone:

So 10 days later it arrived in Anaheim California. The trucks backed it into the Anaheim Convention Center which is roughly like a basketball arena. And in 14 hours the team had put the airplane back together again touched up the paint installed the lighting the sound the backdrop curtains. And if Gulf Stream was showing a brand new airplane today they couldn't have done a better job than what the 30000 guests that passed through the arena this past weekend saw.

Matthew Orloff:

And I can certainly affirm that it. It looked spectacular. The plane itself was beautiful and then there was also a nice display of information photos of Walt which we definitely hope to share and just artifacts from the interior that have been kept in such great condition. Thanks so much to the work you've done to preserve this airplane.

Matthew Orloff:

So to end off I would like to share something special that you mentioned that I was hope was hoping you would speak more on. You mentioned your son flies the same model airplane which would make him the third generation G1 pilot which to my understanding must not exist anywhere. There can't be three generations of pilots who have flown this particular aircraft. Don't fact check me on that because I'm not a hundred percent if it's true but I would not be surprised if it was. So tell us what is your son up to? That's amazing.

Mark Malone:

Well of course my dad Chuck Malone started the flight department and they got the G1 and he became I think the highest time pilot 10400 hours in a single airplane the Disney G1 and then I was fortunate enough to fly it for about seven years as a pilot. My son Miles Malone he joined Phoenix Air out of Cartersville Georgia and they were a large Gulfstream 1 operator. Miles was assigned to Naval Station Point Magoo out in California and he flew shuttle missions to different Navy bases and islands on a two or three times a day basis for about six years.

Mark Malone:

So a couple years ago Gulfstream found it interesting that there were three Malones Chuck Malone Mark Malone Miles Malone that had all flown the Gulfstream 1 with a significant number of hours. And I don't know if it's a record but it's certainly something that our family is very proud of because my dad spent a tremendous amount of time and effort out of his life to establish a safe flight department for transporting Walt Disney and his family the company officials the Imagineers and guests in support of Walt Disney Productions and Walt Disney World Epcot. And it's really my dad's legacy that was on display at the Anaheim Convention Center with a little bit of highlights that Mark and Miles also were lucky enough to fly an airplane just like he did.

Matthew Orloff:

Well it's such an awesome legacy. And might I add the name Miles Malone? What a perfect name for a third generation pilot. I wish I thought of that honestly. But anyway I really appreciate your time here Mark. Last question for you do you have any childhood memories of flying with Walt? Maybe something he said that stuck with you or just something that just sticks out? Because a lot of people who are now enjoying his creation his empire never knew him were not alive at the same time that he was which unfortunately he was lost too soon. So any memories that stick out to you?

Mark Malone:

Well back in the early 1960s the company was small. My dad Chuck Malone when he started the flight department was assigned an office directly next to Walt's office in the Disney Studio in Burbank California. Walt was very interested in being hands on in developing the aviation department with trip planning. It's just really unheard of that your chief pilot has an office directly next to you. So that's how Walt started. That's how close he was with airplanes. And at eight years old I started flying as an invited guest by Walt on trips my dad flew .one in particular was to San Diego Walt wanted to go down and see SeaWorld. So he said to my dad ""Bring your wife and your son and let's go check out SeaWorld."" So as a young kid of eight years old I went down there and I remember him as a genuinely nice grandfather-type person.

Mark Malone:

And so I felt really fortunate to have known him personally a little bit. And he obviously died in 1966 when I was just 11. So I didn't know him as an adult but he was a very generous person. Every Christmas I'd get gifts hand signed cards from him. He was the Grand Marshall of the Rose Parade in January of 1966. He sent a picture signed to Mark my best Walt Disney.

Mark Malone:

So the aviation department and airplanes in general allowed Walt to dream big to build what he was dreaming and then have the world come and see it. So it was really all because he got a Gulfstream and he was able to spread his wings. Florida was so important because he could buy land cheap down there. He basically just bought swamp land land that nobody else wanted from hundreds of owners. And from that they spent a couple years dredging out swamps making beautiful blue lakes. And then from the sand they piled up they were able to build The Magic Kingdom Contemporary Hotel Polynesian the monorail and then expanded into Epcot. So it all started with the mouse as they say in this case it was 234 Mickey Mouse.

Matthew Orloff:

It really is incredible. Just amazing. This airplane in much part turned Orlando Florida which was really just a bunch of marsh lands into what we now know it as today. And I'll actually be heading there next month ironically for the NBAA Base Convention. So funny how that came up from nothing but swamp lands hugely in part because of Disney. And I must say everything you described about him as a person from your memories really lives up to what I would've pictured him as in my head if we were lucky enough to have him around.

Matthew Orloff:

So with that said Mark thank you so much for being a part of this week's podcast. For those listening we'll be back soon with more episodes. And until then blue skies everyone and stay safe. Thank you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vaGVsbG9naWdnbGVzLmNvbS93b21lbi1hdC1kaXNuZXktcHJpbmNlc3MtZWZmZWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"5 Women Working at Walt Disney Animation Studios Explain ""The Princess Effect"" on Their Careers",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://hellogiggles.com/women-at-disney-princess-effect/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vaGVsbG9naWdnbGVzLmNvbS93b21lbi1hdC1kaXNuZXktcHJpbmNlc3MtZWZmZWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvcGhvdG9zLWRpc25leWxhbmQtcmVwbGFjZXMtaWNvbmljLXBlcnBldHVhbGx5LWlsbHVtaW5hdGVkLWxhbXAtaW4td2FsdC1kaXNuZXlzLW1haW4tc3RyZWV0LWFwYXJ0bWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Disneyland Replaces Iconic Perpetually-Illuminated Lamp in Walt Disney's Main Street Apartment,"Disneyland has replaced the iconic lamp in Walt Disney’s former apartment on Main Street to one that more closely matches the lamp that originally stood in its place.

The new lamp has a large glass dome with a floral pattern which is hard to miss.

Of course it was known that the previous lamp was not the original that Walt had in the apartment so the new lamp is no less significant than the one it replaced. The only real significance of the piece is that is stays illuminated a reminder of Walt’s constant presence in the first park he created. However the new lamp perhaps seems to more closely resemble the one that was actually in the apartment during Walt’s time (as best we can tell).

The apartment above the Main Street Fire Station was frequented by Walt and sometimes even his family often from before the park even opened through his death in 1966. The family continued to visit it after his passing. Emile Kuri the famous set decorator who won an Academy Award for his work on 20000 Leagues Under the Sea was originally tasked with decorating and furnishing Walt’s apartment in Town Square.

So what do you think of the new lamp? Is it OK to replace it with a new design after all these years?

WBD,Warner Bros Discovery,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmVhbXR2aW5zaWRlci5jb20vdmlkZW8vY29tY2FzdC1wb3RlbnRpYWxseS1leWVpbmctd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LWJ1eS1yZXBvcnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast potentially eyeing Warner Bros. Discovery buy - report,"Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has been going all-in on cutting costs to alleviate its roughly $53 billion debt. But with uncertain financial prospects the company might find itself in another merger – with Comcast – per a Friday report from The Hollywood Reporter.

The report suggested Comcast CEO Brian Roberts could be interested in combining WBD with NBCUniversal giving the cable giant access to a well-known streaming service in the form of HBO Max.

“Obviously Peacock sucks” one exec familiar with both companies told THR. “There are some good synergies. I’m sure [Roberts] is licking his chops because the [WBD] stock is so low. And I think that’s Zaslav’s endgame. Get the place sold.”

If a Comcast-WBD deal were in the works negotiations likely wouldn’t happen until April 2024 THR’s Kim Masters wrote “for reasons related to the complicated structure of that merger.”

Fierce reached out to WBD for comment and will update with any new information.

Since WBD opened for business in April CEO David Zaslav has reiterated the company wants to build out its streaming assets without overspending on content.

CNN+ was the first step in WBD’s cost-cutting initiative. WBD shuttered the streaming service just one month after its launch.

The company in July also announced it would halt HBO Max original production in several European countries in preparation for a combined HBO Max-Discovery streaming service launch in 2023.

WBD doesn't just want to reduce content spend it reportedly plans to slash its global ad sales team by 30%. The company has stated it aims to achieve $3 billion in annual cost savings.

But WBD’s efforts to lighten its debt load is easier said than done according to a recent Bloomberg Intelligence report.

Analysts wrote in the report WBD “faces daunting challenges including a messier-than-expected merger and a cut to Ebitda guidance amplifies anxieties around its $53 billion debt load.”

However the company is seeing noticeable mileage with HBO Max’s premiere of “House of the Dragon” which garnered nearly 10 million U.S. viewers on its opening night.

Less than a week after the first episode aired HBO renewed the “Game of Thrones” prequel for a second season. “House of the Dragon’s” first season comprised of 10 episodes reportedly cost $200 million.

As for Comcast it recently expressed interest in buying out Hulu from Disney. Comcast currently owns a 33% stake in the streaming platform.

Disney in turn has said it wants to purchase Comcast’s stake in 2024 or earlier. Having full ownership of Hulu means Disney could further integrate the service into its streaming bundle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9jb21jYXN0LWNvdWxkLWJ1eS1odWx1LXdhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1wYXJhbW91bnQtY29tcGV0ZS0xMjM0NzYzNDI4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast Could Buy Hulu Warner Bros. Discovery or Paramount to Compete,"Comcast is looking forward to 2024 a year in which it will gain: A) Hulu or B) a boatload of money based on Hulu’s huge valuation. There’s also C): It could buy another significant media company a purchase possibly financed in part by B. And let’s face it: NBCU needs one of those outcomes to compete in the streaming wars. With or without next-day NBC episodes Peacock is no contender for the crown.

In January 2024 Comcast will likely sell its 33 percent ownership interest in Hulu to Disney. According to a deal the companies made in 2019 Hulu is valued at a guaranteed minimum of $27.5 billion. Disney’s two-thirds ownership share has a baseline value of $18 billion with NBCU’s third at $9 billion but only Disney contractually has to buy its partner out.

At last week’s Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia event Comcast CEO Brian L. Roberts pushed an alternate alternative: What if the seller becomes the buyer?

“If [Hulu] was for sale put up for sale Comcast would be interested and so would a lot of other tech and media companies” Roberts said. “And you would have robust auction. There’s never been a pure-play fabulous scaled streaming service put on the market.”

Fabulous! And also? Unlikely. At $18 billion that would be a very pricey buy for Comcast. Any non-Disney buyers would almost certainly no longer have access to ABC or the FX on Hulu content and given the overall Hulu valuation of $27.5 billion (set by the owners not necessarily the market) it’s a bid that only a trillion-dollar company would — or at least should — really consider. Amazon which just ingested MGM has Prime Video; Apple seems to prefer a small-scale approach; Microsoft and YouTube owner Alphabet seem unlikely to move into a very crowded streaming space that’s already ripe for consolidation. That places Roberts’ claim of Comcast interest somewhere between a threat and a shrewd negotiating tactic.

Other options? Comcast could beef up its streaming presence with key NBCUniversal competitor Paramount Global. If Comcast bought Paramount it could integrate Paramount+ (which now includes Showtime OTT) and FAST leader Pluto TV into its streaming portfolio. At this writing the Paramount Global market cap is $15 billion. Its enterprise value or the amount it would actually cost to purchase the company (value + cash + debt) is about $31 billion. Comcast shares are currently worth a combined $152 billion or about 10 Paramounts. So it’s affordable.

The fly in that particular ointment is CBS since FCC rules don’t allow one company to operate two broadcast networks — and NBCUniversal isn’t about to give up the “NBC.”

Paramount Global chief Bob Bakish believes his company will make for an attractive acquisition target at a time when subscribers and content are king.

“When I look at a company to buy — we’ve done a bunch of smaller deals particularly in Latin America and you can rest assured we look at all the deals — the single most important thing is ‘If you buy the company can you use the content?’ The answer typically is no not for a while” Bakish said a few months back during a Morgan Stanley conference keynote. “Our investment strategy is increasing optionality because we’re gaining more and more control over high-quality content.”

Peacock had 13 million paid subscribers at the end of Q2; Paramount+ had 43 million. Tempting but Comcast executive VP and Deputy CFO Jason Armstrong said it’s less likely. “The focus probably isn’t on acquiring large subscriber bases” he said at a Bank of America investor conference earlier this month. “Instead it’s specific technologies that are either we don’t have or that are better than the current evolution of what we have in the system.”

A bigger play would be one for Warner Bros. Discovery; a few years back Comcast considered disrupting the Discovery takeover with a bid of its own. THR’s Kim Masters wrote that it is “accepted wisdom at the highest levels of the industry” that another deal is coming for WBD. IndieWire confirmed that a meeting between Roberts and WBD boss David Zaslav took place at the Allen & Co. media conference in Sun Valley which presents optical (if circumstantial) evidence of camaraderie. However since discussing M&A options at this point would break a host of laws sometimes it’s just lunch.

WBD’s market cap is slightly more than double Paramount’s at this point and its massive debt ($50 billion) plus considerable cash on hand (about $2 billion) makes this option a considerably larger undertaking if a more-appealing one; you’d want HBO/Max/Discovery+ and their combined 90 million streaming subscribers over Paramount+ and the Warner Bros. studio over Paramount Pictures. Although WBD does not operate a broadcast network like Paramount Global the sheer scale of the buy would create regulatory hurdles. Anyway due to the terms of its April 2022 merger WBD is in an SEC timeout until April 2024.

Comcast declined comment for this story. One Warner Bros.

But in the meantime China has improved its waste management considerably and is probably no longer at the top of that list” says Ramola. Now Southeast Asia seems to be a hotspot. On the one hand there are large populations; on the other sound waste management is sorely lacking. “If there’s not good waste management or solid waste management along the rivers they end up carrying all the plastic or any kind of waste into the oceans” she explains. Even though India and Indonesia are the current hotspots marine litter is a global problem. Coastal areas in Africa like Lagos and Accra are also particularly badly affected by plastic pollution. “But we don’t need to go looking too far” adds Sigve Ånderå. “Even here in Norway we do beach clean-ups every year and there is a lot of plastic waste much of it from fishing gear but also all sorts of packaging plastics. So some areas are more affected than others but no areas are actually spared.”

And we must not forget that a lot of waste that gets treated (or not) in Asia comes from the West. “I don’t think any of us can point fingers at anyone else. We are all responsible. There are just some places with bigger populations where there is more poverty. But at the end of the day we are all in the same boat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbWpiaXpkYWlseS5jb20vaG93LW1hcmlqdWFuYS1jb21wYW5pZXMtY2FuLXByb3Blcmx5LWRpc3Bvc2Utb2YtcHJvZHVjdC13YXN0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How cannabis companies can properly dispose of product waste,"Marijuana regulators are concerned that trashed cannabis will fall into the wrong hands so companies are required to go to great lengths to ensure it’s unusable when thrown out.

Businesses often go as far as mixing old cannabis with sand or kitty litter.

Others spend thousands of dollars on industrial shredders.

“I’ve seen some operators lay out their waste and drive over it with a lawn mower” said Taylor Vozniak of Gaiaca Waste Revitalization based in Gonzales California.

“Followed by mixing with soil mulch sawdust or cardboard.”

Depending on the state the disposal process might need to be documented on video or operators might be required to haul their trash to a permitted solid waste-disposal facility.

“Regardless of disposal method state agencies will require the waste type batch ID and weight of waste to be recorded on paper or electronic manifest entered into their state’s track-and-trace system and be available for audit upon request” Vozniak said.

That’s why some cannabis companies will hire a third-party waste-disposal service to save them the headache.

Compliance is king

“Compliance with state cannabis regulations should be the top priority for all cannabis operators” said Michelle Bodian an attorney in the Boston office of marijuana-focused law firm Vicente Sederberg.

“Some state environmental agencies have issued guidance on how to properly dispose of cannabis waste in compliance with the state’s environmental regulations.

“Understanding which rules apply to your cannabis business is the first step toward compliance.”

To cut down on environmental impacts some companies denature their waste or compost it.

Another environmentally friendly practice is to use the cannabis byproduct for other purposes such as cosmetics or surf wax.

At New York-based Ascend Wellness Holdings Jeff Thompson executive vice president of operations said the company disposes of “green” waste and growing media by running it through a shredder rendering it unusable before it is hauled away for composting.

At Sunset Pipeline Cannabis in San Francisco Marketing Director Bam Deocampo said the easiest way for his company to handle marijuana trash disposal is to go through Recology a waste-management service that adheres to the guidelines of Florida-headquartered traceability company Metrc.

In some California locations cannabis waste is tracked and manifested per Metrc requirements by a third-party waste hauler.

Sunset Pipeline mixes in other materials with the flower so it can’t be smoked.

Deocampo said the company often throws out cannabis that’s defective – such as a vape cartridge – or past an expiration date.

Disposal costs

Cannabis companies can end up spending thousands of dollars on material to mix in the product or on expensive shredders to remain compliant.

To save money Thompson recommends that companies coordinate pickups to coincide with harvest schedules to minimize the number of trips.

Such a move will reduce fuel expenses; the industrial shredder Ascend Wellness uses keeps labor costs down as well.

At Jetty Extracts based in Oakland California Chief Production Officer Nate Ferguson said the company spends about $2000-$2500 per month on a third-party cannabis-disposal operator.

To cut costs Ferguson said “wet cannabis is actually cheaper to dispose of because the waste is measured by volume not weight.”

Jetty used to send its cannabis waste to a worm compost farm.

“The worms slowed down over time” Ferguson said. “We laughed and thought they got too stoned to keep up.”

‘Unusable unrecognizable’

Rules differ from state to state but regulations typically stipulate that waste needs to be rendered “unusable and unrecognizable.”

Some states even require that cannabis waste is blended into a 50:50 mix with “inert” material often sand or kitty litter.

To stay on the right side of regulators Ascend Wellness maintains secure disposal containers for its cannabis waste.

“Cannabis operators should study their state’s cannabis regulations regarding waste before beginning operation to properly understand the requirements around compliant waste management” Vozniak said.

Andy Marshall chief executive officer of Sterilis Solutions headquartered in Chicago offers a shredding machine for cannabis companies that is also used for regulated waste from hospitals and other medical facilities.

The machine takes the labor out of the process others use including mixing sand into cannabis products according to Marshall.

Sterilis’ machine can process gummies vape cartridges flower – all varieties of cannabis waste including the wrappers and packaging it came in.

As an Internet of Things device the machine helps track the waste to ensure it’s compliant with Metrc or other seed-to-sale tracking platforms.

It’s a $65000 autoclave that uses pressurized steam to sterilize the waste before running it through a grinder.

“God love anyone who could find any sort of value in that waste” Marshall said.

This month Oakland Public Works (OPW) which organizes the event is making some adjustments to keep lines and wait times shorter and the experience more convenient for residents.

While the event has always been for Oakland residents only some customers have used the event for commercial trash. Commercial customers will be redirected from these events – they may pay to dispose of large trash loads nearby at the Waste Management Davis Street Transfer Station located at 2615 Davis Street in San Leandro.

Additionally OPW will be limiting rental vehicles allowed at the event. Still allowed are personal vehicles and rental moving vehicles like trucks and vans – up to a length of 10’. Rental moving trucks over 10’ will be redirected to the Davis Street Transfer Station.

These updates to the Bulky Block Party service are intended to keep more Oaklanders moving through the line more swiftly.

OPW knows Oaklanders take pride in their neighborhoods and want to do what they can to keep them clean and healthy so today’s announcement is intended to support the community by promoting services that are available and free. There are several options for disposing of large items additional to the Bulky Block Party events No Oakland resident should have to pay extra to have their bulky items disposed. To dispose of items that won’t fit in your trash cart the following services are available at no charge:

Residents in upstate New York are putting a new state constitutional right to the test in two lawsuits filed this spring alleging that a landfill receiving garbage from the city is disrupting their right to clean air and a healthful environment.



The lawsuits are the first to cite the “right to clean air and water and a healthful environment” which New York voters approved to add to the state constitution at the polls last November according to the plaintiffs’ lawyer Linda Shaw.



Both cases were filed by the same plaintiffs under the organization Fresh Air for the East Side Inc. who reside in Perinton and surrounding towns about 300 miles north of New York City where a portion of the city’s garbage is delivered via rail. For nearly five years the group has been complaining about an increase in odor emanating from High Acres Landfill and Recycling Center which sits on the border of Perinton and nearby Macedon.



One complaint names New York State New York City the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the landfill’s operator Waste Management of New York as defendants; the other names the town of Perinton the town’s zoning board of appeals and Waste Management.



The plaintiffs’ “lives and properties have been and continue to be adversely impacted by persistent noxious offensive Odors and Fugitive Emissions being released from the Landfill” the complaint reads.

Many of the more than 200 residents included in the lawsuit are complaining of nausea headaches and stress says Shaw who is claiming the odors have resulted in a loss in quality of life. “It creates a significant amount of anger in these human beings because they walk outside and it’s disgusting” she told City Limits.



New York City’s garbage is transferred to various landfills and waste conversion facilities in multiple states. High Acres receives waste from The Bronx Queens and Brooklyn according to the city’s Department of Sanitation. Brooklyn waste is also sent to a landfill in Virginia while Staten Island garbage is deposited in South Carolina. The city also sends a portion of waste to facilities in the Northeast that convert it into energy.

Waste Management of New York which runs the landfill could offer only limited comment due to the pending litigation but said that the facility operates in full compliance with regulatory requirements. “The High Acres facility has been a proud partner in the region for 50 years providing numerous economic and environmental benefits” a spokesperson told City Limits.



In 2015 the landfill began accepting garbage from New York City via rail—a means of transporting waste that is intended to reduce truck traffic and associated emissions. The method has largely gotten the support of legislators seeking to reduce the environmental impact of waste transfer facilities historically situated in environmental justice communities. In 2018 the city passed the Waste Equity Law which reduces the capacity for waste transfer stations located in four overburdened community districts but which included exemptions for facilities that transport garbage using trains rather than trucks.



But as seen in Perinton and the surrounding towns the method can have a negative impact on the other end of the line. Garbage often sits in the sealed railroad cars for days on end leading to a worse odor when it’s finally emptied into the landfill explained Shaw. The DEC confirmed that it does not have oversight of how long the garbage sits in the cars.

Adi Talwar April 5 2022: Corner of East 135th Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan



“We’re not saying New York City garbage is stinkier than anybody else’s it’s just that because it cooks in these railroad cars that are sealed” she said. “So when they open those railroad cars it’s terrible.”



A spokesperson for Waste Management noted that two studies conducted by DEC the town of Perinton and Waste Management in 2019 and 2020 found no difference between rail and trailer deliveries.



In December Perinton Town Supervisor Ciaran Hanna announced a new five-year host community agreement aimed at reducing odor from the landfill. Among the measures was to limit the age of waste disposed of there to no more than seven days from transfer facility to the landfill. It also reduced the capacity of highly odorous waste—biosolids a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process—by half and stipulated that only 50 percent of all trash dropped at the landfill can be from New York City. In 2020 90 percent of the landfill’s capacity was from the five boroughs the complaint shows. That reflects an increase of 284392 tons of garbage from New York City in 2015 to 646744 tons five years later.



The issue has also not gone unnoticed by the DEC which has intervened multiple times. In September 2020 DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos wrote a letter to the district manager of Waste Management Jeffrey Richardson noting that odor complaints related to the landfill had “increased markedly” that month and that operational issues at the landfill including insufficient use of misting systems that help tamp down the smell were contributing to the problem.

“New York State’s top priority is ensuring that area residents are not exposed to any potential site-related health or safety hazards” a spokesperson for the agency told City Limits. “DEC rigorously oversees all operations at the WM facility and responds to community concerns about odors. In addition DEC works with WM to minimize odors and implement air monitoring.”

Between 2021 and 2022 the DEC authorized the facility to add a geomembrane cover over nearly 12 acres of the site to reduce odor. The company will add a cover over an additional 20 acres later this year the DEC said.



The agency has taken several other measures this year to intervene including partnering with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to monitor air quality in real time with a specialized vehicle. The screening tool found no health or safety concerns but did find methane levels to be above the reporting limit according to the agency.



Methane a common byproduct of waste facilities is more than 25 times more powerful in contributing to global warming than carbon dioxide according to the EPA.



The lawsuits allege that emissions associated with the landfill also violate the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act statewide legislation aimed at reducing emissions arguing there are practical ways for the state agency and site operator to reduce the volume of gasses escaping the facility.



“What we’re asking for not only under this new green amendment but also under the new Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act [is] that they do what they’re supposed to do” said Shaw. “It’s not being managed properly.”

Baffinland has posted on social media several times when it's noted a cruise ship going more than nine knots which is the mining company's own speed limit for its contracted vessels. On Sept. 13 the company posted about a cruise ship sailing at 13.8 knots — speeds it called ""troubling.""

""Baffinland documents and reports all marine violations our ships included. The reason for our posts is not to shame or pass blame but to raise awareness about the need for standardized regulations for all ships in northern waterways"" said Peter Akman Baffinland's head of stakeholder relations.

""Baffinland ships voluntarily adhere to restrictions such as a maximum speed of nine knots and staying within an established shipping route in order to minimize any potential impact on marine mammals and the environment as a whole.""

In early August Baffinland reported its shipping monitors had tracked a Norwegian passenger ship travelling at speeds of 11 knots and entering what the Twitter post said included several Inuit ecological ""no go zones"" and narwhal calving grounds.

Nansen Polar Expeditions replied to Baffinland's post attributing the ship's speed and location to poor weather and saying they had been in touch with the community of Pond Inlet.

Baffinland’s Shipping Monitors have tracked a Norwegian passenger ship travelling at speeds of 11 kn & entering several Inuit ecological ‘no go zones’ & narwhal calving grounds.

Located at the eastern entry of the Northwest Passage Pond Inlet has seen about 20 cruise ships this summer.

Baffinland whose port for the Mary River iron mine lies in Milne Inlet about 100 kilometres away from the community of Pond Inlet now receives alerts when any vessel in that area travels over nine knots.

Full-time Inuit shipping monitors based in Pond Inlet track and view vessels and provide daily updates Akman said.

Shipboard monitors on MV Botnica record data on marine mammal locations and behaviour other vessels ice conditions and seabird observations he said.

Baffinland works with community members hunters and trappers organizations and hamlets to ensure that all concerns related to shipping activities are considered Akman said.

Hunters in Pond Inlet have said shipping activity from Baffinland's Mary River Mine has a negative impact on narwhal numbers in the area.

While Baffinland has acknowledged the drop in narwhal numbers the company has argued there's no clear proof its shipping activities are to blame as other environmental factors such as changing sea ice conditions or new predator and prey dynamics could be at play.

In an online document about its marine wildlife monitoring Baffinland calls its current speed limit ""a strong and conservative mitigation measure.""

""To our knowledge this continues to be the lowest nautical speed limit in Canada"" said Lou Kamermans Baffinland's senior director of sustainable development in a June letter to the Nunavut Impact Review Board.

Meanwhile Baffinland awaits a recommendation from the Nunavut Impact Review Board next week on its move to keep Mary River ore production at six million tonnes.

No speed limits for cruise ships in Canadian Arctic waters

Transport Canada does not regulate specific speed restrictions in Canadian Arctic waters said Sau Sau Liu senior communications advisor with Transport Canada.

That's although there is a ""voluntary slowdown"" in marine protected areas particularly around the Anguniaqvia Niqiqyuam and the Tarium Niryutait in the western Arctic Liu said.

The Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators said its members are obligated to ""always comply with local and federal speed regulations and other legally required environmental protection measures.""

But the association does not have any additional regulations of its own regarding speed for cruise ships said Anne Øien the association's communications manager.

Pond Inlet lies in the heart of the Tallurutiup Imanga national marine conservation area.

As such Kristin Westdal science director at the conservation organization Oceans North supports the call for speed reductions by ships travelling in and around Tallurutiup Imanga.

Westdal said all operators should slow down in an area that is a ""sensitive and important narwhal habitat.""

He said this was due to the growth of marine life in Sarawak waters.

“We have received feedback that the fishermen’s catches have increased due to an increase in fish resources and this has provided an impact on their lives and income” he told a press conference after witnessing the deployment of the final reef ball for Phase 1 of the project at Pulau Satang waters near here yesterday.

A total of 16800 artificial reef balls have been deployed along the coastal waters of Sarawak from Tanjung Datu Lundu to Lawas.

Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC) which had been entrusted to carry out the RM70 million project since 2018 has managed to deploy the reef balls in 740 clusters of 20 to 30 reef balls along 720km out of 900km coastlines of Sarawak.

Abang Johari said that the Sarawak Reef Ball Project contributed significantly to the increase of fish especially in coastal areas.

“Most of the places where the reef balls have been deployed now contained a lot of fish and therefore (fishing) is no longer dependent on seasons.

“As such this has a positive effect from an economic point of view for people living in coastal areas” he said.

On another matter Abang Johari said the issue of foreign fishermen encroaching in Sarawak’s coastal waters has been taken seriously by the state government.

He pointed out that this was why the Sarawak Coast Guard was established to protect the coastal areas under the state’s jurisdiction so that they will not be encroached by foreign fishermen.

“Sometimes those (foreign fishermen) who catch fish in the deep sea also approach coastal areas.

“That is why we decided to establish the Sarawak Coast Guard to protect marine wildlife in Sarawak’s waters” he said.

Also present were Deputy Premiers Datuk Amar Awang Tengah Ali Hasan and Dato Sri Dr Sim KuiHian Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Urban Development Datu Len Talif Salleh Deputy Minister of Utility and Telecommunication (Utility) Datuk Dr Abdul Rahman Junaidi SFC chief executive officer Zolkipli Mohamad Aton and Sarawak Forest Department director Datu Hamden Mohammad.",,,,,,,,,

On the heels of an FDA go-ahead for gene therapy Zynteglo bluebird bio has won an FDA accelerated approval for Skysona or eli-cel for the rare neurological disorder cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) the company said Friday. The company is charging $3 million per treatment with Skysona higher than Zynteglo’s $2.8 million making it the priciest therapy in the world.

Unlike Zynteglo a beta thalassemia therapy bluebird won’t offer an outcomes-based payment for Skysona because the rarity and complexity of CALD makes such an arrangement “extremely challenging to implement for both bluebird and payers” bluebird CEO Andrew Obenshain told investors during a conference call Monday.

The price tag reflects “the clinical benefit [Skysona] provides as an urgently needed treatment option to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in children impacted by progressive irreversible and fatal rare disease” Obenshain added.

Skysona is bluebird’s second gene therapy after Zynteglo in the U.S. Previously the biotech had to pull both products in Europe and folded commercial activities in the region after failing to reach reimbursement agreements with local governments.

Because of their potential to treat life-threatening diseases with a one-dose treatment gene therapies are very costly. Before Zynteglo and Skysona the title of the world’s most expensive drug belonged to Novartis’ spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy Zolgensma which carries a $2.1 million list price.

CALD is marked by neurologic decline which can lead to complete loss of voluntary movement. Without treatment about half of patients—primarily boys—die within five years of symptom onset. Skysona is allowed to treat boys 4 to 17 years of age with early active CALD.

By bluebird’s estimate ALD affect about 1 in 21000 newborn males in the U.S. and 4 in 10 are expected to develop the cerebral form. This translates into altogether about 40 cases per year in the U.S.

The FDA handed out the accelerated approval based on data from two small clinical trials. The drug was found to be better than natural history data at preventing the emergence of functional disabilities or death after two years.

To confirm Skysona’s efficacy for a potential full approval bluebird has rolled over the 67 patients treated with the gene therapy in the two clinical trials into a longer follow-up trial to continue monitoring safety and efficacy data through 15 years bluebird Chief Medical Officer Rich Colvin M.D. Ph.D. said on the call. Additional data from commercially treated patients will also be counted.

Right before granting the approval the FDA also lifted a clinical hold that it previously issued in August 2021. The hold was in place after a patient who got Skysona developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) a type of blood cancer. Altogether three patients in Skysona’s clinical program showed MDS which is believed to be caused by the Lenti-D viral vector that bluebird uses to deliver a functional ABCD1 gene into the human genome. Skysona comes with a boxed warning for hematologic malignancy.

“We are confident that the risks of Skysona will be weighed carefully with the risks of other treatment approaches and the CALD itself as families and clinicians make these complex and deeply personal treatment decisions” Obenshain said.

Bluebird plans to make Skysona commercially available by the end of 2022 at designated treatment centers initially only at Boston Children’s Hospital and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Besides the previous clinical hold on Skysona the FDA also has an ongoing partial clinical hold on Zynteglo’s sister med lovo-cel in sickle cell disease. The agency put the temporary suspension in place in late 2021 following one case of persistent non-transfusion-dependent anemia. Bluebird is still “in correspondence with the FDA” and the company has no estimate on when the hold might be resolved Obenshain said.

The two back-to-back approvals give bluebird two priority review vouchers which the company plans to sell for around $100 million each to keep operations running. The European commercial setback and the multiple clinical holds led to a restructuring that bluebird launched in April.

Bluebird expects the overhaul will reduce its annual cash burn to $240 million to $245 million in 2023 Chief Strategy and Financial Officer Jason Cole said on the call. The company believes it has “sufficient resources to successfully commercialize Zynteglo as well as Skysona and to file the lovo-cell [biologics application] on time in the first quarter of 2023” Cole said.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eris Lifesciences’ CMD Amit Bakshi buys luxury apartment in Mumbai’s Worli for Rs 61 crore,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

With around 33% internet penetration the lowest of any region in the world several governments across the continent are embracing more nimble and effective means of delivering services and interacting with citizens. A considerable number of businesses are also leveraging digitally centered models to connect with the hundreds of millions of customers previously out of reach.

In West Africa Ghana and Nigeria are leading the innovation drive in the region. This progress is the result of strategic and systematic investments in developing digital infrastructure services skills and entrepreneurship.

A growing number of the youth population are even more aware that if they would become tomorrow’s innovators entrepreneurs and leaders they will need to be empowered with the digital skills alongside access to technology and markets that are essential to thrive in an increasingly digitized global economy.

Across all sectors of the economy Digital transformation is impacting innovation and enabling progress for diverse industries. For example in the energy sector digitization has become an enabler of energy transitions and transforming how energy is produced distributed and consumed.

Most states in West Africa are already embracing Modern smart grids that rely on advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks for monitoring and billing purposes. Yet there is the challenge of electricity theft to contend with. The critical concern within the region remains how to improve access to energy and provide everyone with reliable and available energy in sufficient quantities.

Leading experts across the sector believe that improving access to energy within the region requires attracting key local and international investors to dialogue with other stakeholders for the purpose of discovering viable mechanisms to solve the challenges in the energy sector. In Nigeria the Nigeria Energy Exhibition and Conference has maintained a long commitment to achieving this.

Making a long-awaited in-person return to Lagos Nigeria from September 20 to 22 2022. The Nigeria Energy Exhibition and Conference now in its 9th edition is expected to bring together many energy equipment manufacturers distributors procurement professionals dealers and regulators to lead the discourse on accelerating West Africa’s sustainable energy supply.

More than 3000 stakeholders are also expected to attend with over 100 exhibitors representing over 21 countries. Organizers of the conference believe that creating an enabling environment that allows technology to thrive in the sector will help build investor’s confidence.

Themed “Affordable reliable and sustainable energy through collaboration” the event provides a viable platform for the public and private sector in Nigeria to engage with international energy leaders and investors towards proffering solutions to Nigeria’s energy challenges. Among key discussions Nigeria Energy will address digitalisation of Nigeria’s power sector – boosting efficiency and reducing costs of power generation and transmission and distribution.

Other key discussions will focus on meeting electricity demand and improving the reliability of Nigeria’s power sector regulatory and policy requirements to attract local and international investment securing financing for gas-power generation and renewable energy plants exploring the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) investment in transmission infrastructure opportunities and challenges of decentralising power generation developing renewable energy in Nigeria and security of power equipment and infrastructure.

The Honourable Minister of Power – Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu represented by Mr. Temitope Fashedemi FNIM Permanent Secretary Federal Ministry of Power Director of Investment – Engr. Faruk Yusuf Yabo and Ag. Director of Renewables – Engr. Abubakar Ali both at the Federal Ministry of Power and MD Transmission Company of Nigeria – Engr. (Dr.) S.A. Abdulaziz MD of Rural Electrification Agency – Ahmad Salihijo are part of over 35 speakers that will speak during various sessions at the event.

A recent analysis of the global power sector by the International Energy Agency shows that digitalisation has the potential to save around $80 billion per year or about 5% of total annual power generation costs.

From remote monitoring solutions to interconnection financing payment solutions modelling and system design the place of technology and digitization in advancing Nigeria’s energy sector cannot be overemphasized.

While the Nigerian power market is driven by favourable government policies and a growing inclination toward privatization the sector is still challenged by a lack of skilled local labour power theft and infrastructure vandalization among others.

To this end it is imperative to leverage digital technology in the electricity industry towards ensuring greater transparency in operations while increasing efficiency and reliability.

Therefore relevant stakeholders in the industry GenCos DisCos and the government will be looking forward to exploring the massive opportunities for advancement within the energy sector while embracing the array of cutting-edge products and services that will be showcased at this year’s Nigeria Energy Exhibition and Conference.

Join Nigeria Energy this year from 20 – 22 September at Landmark Centre Lagos as it evolves for a digitalised decentralised and decarbonised future.

WRK,WestRock,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzcndpcmUuY29tL3ByZXNzX3JlbGVhc2VzLzc1NDg3Ni1kb21pbm9zci1uZXctcGFja2FnaW5nLWRlc2lnbi1lbmNvdXJhZ2VzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1kby10aGVpci1zbGljZS1pbmNyZWFzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSRWire - Domino's® New Packaging Design Encourages Customers to “Do Their Slice” to Increase Recycling Efforts,"Published 09-19-22 Submitted by WestRock

September 19 2022 /CSRwire/ - Nearly everything that leaves a Domino’s® store leaves in the same type of packaging: a corrugated box made of more than 70 percent recycled content. To continue meeting the demands for recycled content in corrugated packaging it is key that pizza boxes are consistently diverted from landfills. Domino’s® knows that to do this it must continue delivering the facts about pizza box recycling to its customers.

And what better way to do that than through the box itself?

WestRock and Domino’s® partnered to print recycling messaging on their pizza boxes in August reaching hundreds of thousands of consumers every day. The expanded messaging encourages customers to “Do Their Slice” and is accompanied by a guide featuring additional steps on how to properly recycle their boxes. Domino’s® new boxes also have a QR code sending users to recycling.dominos.com where a look-up tool provides access to a nationwide database of recycling guidelines.

By reinforcing the facts and directing consumers to recycling.dominos.com these new boxes are a key step in reaching the vision of pizza box acceptance in all recycling programs.

“We applaud and support Domino’s® for taking this positive and creative next step to further educate on the recyclability of pizza boxes” said Patrick Kivits president of Corrugated Packaging at WestRock. “Recycled pizza boxes contribute to a circular economy and that makes our planet better.”

Despite high demand for sustainable packaging many consumers still don’t recycle or do not know enough about how to properly recycle. Additionally many centers across the country do not “explicitly accept” pizza boxes for recycling. When an industry study conducted in 2020 by WestRock Domino’s® primary box supplier proved that grease and cheese residue does not impact the recyclability of the box the two industry leaders partnered to launch recycling.dominos.com as a way to combat misinformation and increase pizza box recycling efforts.

The website includes facts intended to change consumer perceptions influence behaviors and increase pizza box recycling. The website also shares educational content including instructions on how to recycle pizza boxes as well as a guide on what to do if a customer's community does not accept pizza boxes for recycling.

WestRock has been at the forefront of proving how easy recycling can be with tools like its Scan. Learn. Recycle. portal to educate and encourage local pizza box recycling guidelines. They are committed to partnering with customers like Domino’s® to spread awareness and enhance messaging across its channels to improve recycling rates.

Since 2020 Domino’s® has continued to advocate for pizza box recycling beyond recycling.dominos.com through customer emails social media and presentations to the American Pizza Community (APC) during which they asked peers to also promote the recyclability of pizza boxes.

Domino’s® is dedicated to diverting waste and increasing sustainable impact through the use of responsible and recyclable packaging with partners like WestRock.

The brand joined with SCAD's multidisciplinary team of professors graduate and undergraduate students from the university's top-ranked degree programs furniture design industrial design and illustration to research and design concept collections that balance the functional and holistic requirements of working from home. The result: design-forward silhouettes in elegant finishes grounded by ergonomics and comfort at every touchpoint. The overall purpose of the project was to target the shift toward remote working focusing on how for many home has become as much about work life and the shifting meaning and use of home as the center of family community life and engagement.

Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams President and CEO Allison O'Connor notes ""Two pillars of our company attest to how our purpose is to be Artisans of Comfort for All and how we aspire to be a Modern Maverick home brand. In speaking to our customers through products that must align with a world in which the very nature of work has changed and how homes will continue to adapt to our new environment we embraced an exciting and important opportunity. We collaborated with the famed and prestigious furniture design program at Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia close to our own factories in North Carolina on a project to define furniture for the new meaning of work at home. Focusing on how to unfold the meaning of comfort this work-from-home collection melds emotion function aesthetic and efficiency into new timeless pieces that continue the MG+BW journey as a courageous brand that chooses to speak bravely to every homeowner seeking to make home that place to honor who what and how they love.""

In addition the collaboration affirms Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams' commitment to the future of American design and to the next generation of designers.

To truly understand how integrating the workplace and the home affects the consumer the SCADpro team began with the principles of human-centered research analyzing over 82 survey responses. The feedback revealed the four key insights that the team then targeted throughout the design process – emotion comfort aesthetic and efficiency. This detailed research confirmed that the future of work is a hybrid environment with consumers in need of a dedicated home workspace to suit a dual lifestyle.

With this collection the brand is offering products designed with that user feedback in mind. Integrating everything from work habits and ergonomics like ideal desk height and healthy sitting posture to smart storage solutions for office essentials like printers and files it gives flexible workspace when needed then transitions back into beautiful pieces for daily living.

The pieces are crafted from natural and sustainably sourced materials. The timeless modern Alba Collection combines a dark oak finish and brushed stainless steel hardware with vegan leather accents. The elegantly curved fashion-forward Ella Collection features oak in a brushed white finish with champagne brass details. And a third desk chair option the executive-style Eva Chair features rich Italian leather and a distinctive openwork metal base.

""We are delighted to learn that this partnership has resulted in two of the collections designed Alba and Ella as well as the Eva Chair being introduced to the market. Thank you to the students for going the extra mile. Thank you to Bob Williams for working with the class to understand Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams' dedication to comfort the importance of detail craftsmanship and sustainability. And thank you to Allison O'Connor and the Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams team for being an inspiration and giving our students this incredible opportunity"" says Frederick Spector Associate Chair of Furniture Design at SCAD.

I recently came across the QOD from June 11 2013 which discussed hauntings at some of the casino/hotels. As we approach the Halloween season can you tell me if there have been any recent sightings at these hotels and have there been any new sightings in places not previously listed? I know the Apache Hotel at Binion's has been using this as a selling point to get people to stay there.

A:

That QoD from nearly 10 years ago described sightings at primarily Luxor but also Bally's Bellagio Circus Circus Flamingo Planet Hollywood Plaza and Whiskey Pete's. You can read them here.

This was a challenging update (in more ways than one); PR departments aren't normally too enthusiastic to promote ghosts on their properties. But we did unearth so to speak a few new stories.

Here are a couple courtesy of the Haunted Vegas Tour & Ghost Hunt.

The tour visits Fox Ridge Park in Henderson where the ghost of a young boy is sometimes seen riding the swing set. Tourists who have visited it recently have taken photos of the swing set that when developed showed either a shadow on the swing or orbs in its immediate vicinity.

Another venue popular with the paranormal is Bally’s Las Vegas presently being converted to a Horseshoe. It's most famous as being the second of three MGM Grand hotels the one that was the tragic site of the 1980 fire that took more than 80 lives. A veteran Bally’s/MGM dealer recently shared with the tour that she'd been dealing blackjack when a nearby table erupted as though somebody had hit a big win. She looked up and recognized “Robert” a dealer who'd died in the fire still wearing the same uniform. Shaken she looked down at her cards for a moment and — when she looked up again — the table was empty.

If you want to do some DIY ghost-hunting you can rub elbows with spirits at the Mob Museum. Staffers there believe the former courthouse is haunted perhaps because it's now filled with the bric-a-brac of murder and mayhem.

At MGM Grand according to Vegas.com “The most chilling ghostly encounter is an elderly woman who is said to occupy a bank of slot machines on the casino floor. She calmly plays two games at once as her dress engulfs her in flames. If approached she disappears.”

We also heard that the Westgate is ""filled with the spiritual presence of Elvis Presley"" its most famous headliner when it opened as the International. If true Elvis might not have left the building after all.

Finally one venue that could be expected to host apparitions or otherworldly sightings has been noticeably lacking in reports of such. The Ghostbar on the 55th floor of the Palms is from all indications mercifully free of its spectral namesakes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvY29uY2VydHMvMjAyMi1saWZlLWlzLWJlYXV0aWZ1bC1kYXktMy1jYWx2aW4taGFycmlzLWphY2staGFybG93LTEyMzUxNDE0MDQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlsbGJvYXJkLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9jb25jZXJ0cy8yMDIyLWxpZmUtaXMtYmVhdXRpZnVsLWRheS0zLWNhbHZpbi1oYXJyaXMtamFjay1oYXJsb3ctMTIzNTE0MTQwNC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack Harlow Calvin Harris & More of the Best Moments From Life Is Beautiful 2022 Day 3,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvY29uY2VydHMvMjAyMi1saWZlLWlzLWJlYXV0aWZ1bC1kYXktMy1jYWx2aW4taGFycmlzLWphY2staGFybG93LTEyMzUxNDE0MDQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlsbGJvYXJkLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9jb25jZXJ0cy8yMDIyLWxpZmUtaXMtYmVhdXRpZnVsLWRheS0zLWNhbHZpbi1oYXJyaXMtamFjay1oYXJsb3ctMTIzNTE0MTQwNC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394F758E80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Early in September the 16-year-old announced that she would be staying close to home to play Division I college hockey for the Minnesota Golden Gophers.

""I chose Minnesota because it's close to home and it has a great coaching staff and team culture. They have a winning mindset which is something I want to be a part of"" said Puppe on her decision.

The Northfield native grew up watching the maroon and gold as her youth hockey association would travel up to the Twin Cities to watch the Gophers from time to time.

Growing up in the Northfield area Puppe was surrounded by a neighborhood of hockey players and her two older sisters Brynn and Nora  played the sport as well.

This past season with the Raiders Puppe posted 39 goals and 31 assists in only 29 games. Northfield also made a Class AA state tournament appearance in 2021-22.

""We had a really good team we bonded well so I'm really excited for this year ... We have all played with each other since U8 so it's cool to grow up with them (her teammates) and play with them"" she said.

The Minnesota native's skills caught the eyes of Team USA this summer as Puppe participated in the Women's National Festival in Buffalo New York where the top 32 players in the nation competed for a spot on the U18 team roster.

""I'm fast intense and get everyone on the ice involved in the play ... I'm always trying to improve every area of my game"" says the forward on her playing style.

The Northfield native has been on the varsity roster since her seventh grade season and still has two more years left of high school hockey. You can expect her to hit the ice for Minnesota in 2024-25.

When she's not out on the ice Puppe enjoys hanging out with friends and family and going to the lake.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmV2ZXJibHVlc2hpcnRzLmNvbS9uZXcteW9yay1yYW5nZXJzLW1hdHQtYmFydGtvd3NraS10by1wdG8v0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yZXZlcmJsdWVzaGlydHMuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLXJhbmdlcnMtbWF0dC1iYXJ0a293c2tpLXRvLXB0by9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Rangers sign defenseman Matt Bartkowski to PTO - Forever Blueshirts,"New York Rangers sign defenseman Matt Bartkowski to PTO

On Sunday evening the New York Rangers signed defenseman Matt Bartkowski to a Professional Tryout (PTO) contract per CapFriendly.

Bartkowski 34 is a left-handed blue-liner that played for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the AHL last season. In 72 games he registered 16 points 29 penalty minutes and a +7 rating.

The 6-1′ 203 pound defender did not play in the NHL for the 2021-22 campaign. Since the 2018-19 season he’s played only 3 games in the big leagues all with the Minnesota Wild.

In his career Bartkowski has amassed 48 points in 256 games with 157 penalty minutes. He was drafted in the 7th round by the Florida Panthers in 2007 but was traded to the Boston Bruins in 2010 before ever suiting up for them.

New York Rangers sign Matt Bartkowski to PTO

Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports

The Rangers now have two players on PTO for training camp which opens on Wednesday September 21. Forward Jimmy Vesey was signed to a Professional Tryout earlier this month and he will battle for a spot on the team’s fourth line.

Vesey 29 registered 8 goals and 15 points in 68 games for the New Jersey Devils last season. According to GM Chris Drury it was watching him up close that made them interested.

“The things he was able to do really well for Jersey last year excited us” Drury relayed per USA Today’s Vince Mercogliano. “Bottom six big guy physical player had a really good year on the PK. He’ll get a chance here to show us what he can do.”

As for Bartkowski this seems a little more surprising of a move based on comments Drury made last week.

“We’re still actively looking at some PTOs for defensemen” Drury said. “I think we’re pretty comfortable right now with who we have back there.”

Well maybe not that comfortable.

Perhaps Drury and the rest of the coaches were not pleased with what they say in the Rangers rookies back-to-back losses against the Flyers rookies.

We know both Zac Jones and Matthew Robertson will be competing with Libor Hajek for the third pair left defense job at camp. Maybe the organization wanted to stiffen that competition simply by having another veteran competing for the spot.

Should Bartkowski earn a standard contract expect it to be for the league minimum.

Even if Bartkowski doesn’t pan out Drury told reporters that they would be open to using the waiver wire for a defender during the season.

“Astronauts could use rHEALTH to perform a full self-diagnosis without technical training” said Eugene Chan inventor of the unit. “They only need a drop of blood saliva or urine to put into the reader and within minutes they have the results of a range of crucial health indicators.”

Rupaul Thanawala

That attitude goes far beyond Trident – a professional service provider specializing in business strategy and digital transformation for supply chain and global financial compliance which has 50 employees and a fast-growing footprint that covers more than 30 countries – to her civic work in central Indiana.

Thanawala’s efforts have led the Indiana Chamber of Commerce to name her its 2022 NextEra Energy Resources Dynamic Leader of the Year.

Kevin Brinegar

“When you think about leadership you think about someone with initiative and drive to make things better for others” offers Indiana Chamber President and CEO Kevin Brinegar. “Whether working on behalf of her clients serving as a mentor for her employees or countless other groups – particularly those that are under-represented or jumping in with both feet on any number of volunteer efforts Rupal exhibits those traits.”

There are many adjectives that describe Thanawala he continues including eager energetic intelligent and innovative. But the best word to describe the Mumbai native who moved to the U.S. three decades ago might be “fixer.”

For instance last year she jumped head-first into an effort to outfit Camp Atterbury with a commercial-grade computer lab for people uprooted from their Afghan homes and transplanted here due to the upheaval in that country. The digital literacy project was instrumental in helping young Afghans not only with educational opportunities but entertainment. The adults used the lab for resume building and job searches as well as a vital connection to family in far-flung locations. The program initiated by Thanawala was quickly expanded to nine military bases turned into refugee camps throughout the U.S. and impacted 94000 guests.

Thanawala has championed numerous under-represented groups over the years including serving as president of the Asian American Alliance; board member of BDPA formerly the Black Data Processing Associates; and technology editor for the Indianapolis Recorder a volunteer position she says helps bring technology news and information to Black and urban audiences. She is also on the supervisory committee for Financial Center Credit Union.

If you ask Thanawala to describe herself she doesn’t hesitate: “I’m truly a servant leader.”

“It’s my personal calling” she shares. “As a business leader we owe it to give back to our community. It’s imperative that we give back in terms of tech education working on issues regarding diversity and inclusion and preparing leaders of various backgrounds for tomorrow.”

The Dynamic Leader of the Year Award will be presented at the Indiana Chamber’s 33rd Annual Awards Dinner presented by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield on November 16 at the Indiana Convention Center.

But perhaps most importantly they rely on you for healthcare—and that includes regular vet visits. ""One year in a dog's life can be equivalent to five to seven years of a human's life"" says Heather Berst DVM veterinarian and medical lead with Zoetis. ""So a lot can change in that year."" But if your dog seems otherwise healthy it can be easy to think that a checkup isn't necessary. According to veterinarians though you should never skip your dog's annual appointment. Read on to learn the most important reasons why this once-a-year vet visit is so important. Don't have one in the books? Schedule it ASAP to ensure your pup lives its happiest healthiest and longest life.

READ THIS NEXT: The 7 Best Dogs for Beginners Vets Say.

1 Your dog needs to stay up-to-date on vaccines.

Vaccines are equally as important for dogs as they are for humans. ""Dogs need to attend their annual vet visit because annual vaccines protect against harmful and potentially fatal diseases which all dogs are at risk for"" says Berst. ""Some diseases such as leptospirosis and rabies can even be transmitted to people."" And with many folks traveling and socializing with their dogs more than ever Berst notes it's especially important to vaccinate your dog against diseases like bordetella or kennel cough and canine influenza. ""Your veterinarian will be able to talk to you about which vaccines make the most sense to protect your dog and keep them healthy"" Berst adds.

2 Your dog needs a stool screening.

While veterinarians vary in how often they recommend specific screenings a stool screening is common at many annual appointments. ""It looks for any parasites abnormal bacteria or cells including blood cells in the fecal sample"" says Sarah Wooten DVM veterinary expert at Pumpkin Pet Insurance. ""This is important because dogs can often carry occult meaning hidden infestations with intestinal parasites including hookworms roundworms coccidia and giardia."" Because some of those parasites are infectious to people you'll want to ensure your dog is worm-free on a regular basis. ""In addition if there are any problems with the intestines then a fecal screening can pick up problems early before they become bigger problems"" says Wooten.

3 Your dog needs its heart checked.

An annual listen with the trusty stethoscope can help your pup stay in top health. ""Your veterinarian will listen to your dog's heart and can hear things like heart murmurs or irregular heartbeats"" says Berst. ""These can be fairly common as dogs age and getting them on medication can help keep them healthy longer."" See it's all about preventative care.

4 Your dog needs a urine check.

This is a test that may not occur at every annual wellness screening but should happen regularly. For older dogs it's suggested each year. ""This test will screen for infection and the possibility of bladder stones"" says Jamie Whittenburg DVM lead veterinarian at Senior Tail Waggers. ""It also will test for glucose in the urine which can signal that the dog has diabetes mellitus and the urinalysis will give an indication of the dog's kidney function.""

5 Your dog needs a blood test.

Many vets will do blood work annually on dogs over the age of six. ""These tests will screen the red and white blood cells looking for anemia infections blood cancers and other illnesses"" says Whittenburg. ""Additionally organ function tests will evaluate the functioning of the dog's thyroid liver kidneys and pancreas as well as blood sugar proteins cholesterol and electrolytes.""

6 Your dog can be assessed for discomfort.

In particular for osteoarthritis the early signs of which ""can be subtle but can still cause your dog pain"" says Berst. ""Your veterinarian can examine your dog for signs of it and talk to you about what to look for at home."" There are medications and other methods of managing this pain for dogs so you'll want to ensure you're aware of the issue. That way you can make your pup as comfortable as possible.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

7 Your dog needs its teeth assessed.

Since there's no such thing as a doggie dentist this task falls under your veterinarian's domain. ""Dogs can live longer and feel better with good dental health"" says Berst. ""At the exam your veterinarian will check for gingivitis plaque and tarter."" They may recommend a dental cleaning if they believe it will benefit your pup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvaW5kaWEtcy1maXJzdC1vZmYtdGhlLXNoZWxmLWNlbGwtdGhlcmFweS10cmVhdG1lbnQtZm9yLWtuZWUtb3N0ZW9hcnRocml0aXMtMTIyMDkxODAwNTk1XzEuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvY29tcGFuaWVzL2luZGlhLXMtZmlyc3Qtb2ZmLXRoZS1zaGVsZi1jZWxsLXRoZXJhcHktdHJlYXRtZW50LWZvci1rbmVlLW9zdGVvYXJ0aHJpdGlzLTEyMjA5MTgwMDU5NV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's first off-the-shelf cell therapy treatment for knee osteoarthritis,"Around 35 million people suffer from knee osteoarthritis in India and current treatment options include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Hyaluronic Acid injections steroid injections etc
