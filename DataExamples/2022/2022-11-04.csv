Thousands more line the streets to cheer them on.

Whether it's 26.2 miles or 42.195 kilometers depends on where you are in the world. About a million runners every year clamor at the start line to become a marathoner. Less than 1% of the world's population has ever completed a marathon.

A joke in the running community after completing a marathon is to say ""Never again"" -- and then sign up for another one. For some the goal is to run each of the six Abbott World Marathon Majors: Berlin Boston Chicago London New York City and Tokyo earning a star for each one finished. There are 8066 six-star finishers following the 2022 Chicago Marathon representing 103 countries around the world.

On Sunday the New York City Marathon will be the final major of the year and 73 runners at the start line will be aiming to join the list of six-star finishers. Who are these athletes? It's not just elite runners.

Here are five who've done it -- and one who's looking to earn his sixth star in New York on Sunday.

Ron Romano age 61

Ron Romano logs onto the Zoom interview decked out in Abbott World Marathon Majors gear. He has his hat and his gaiter around his neck. Behind him is his medal rack and other running paraphilia.

It's very clear even before he speaks that running is his passion. Romano is full of life and lots of energy. He has an active Instagram and Podcast called ""RunChats with Ron Runs NYC"" where he talks to runners from all walks of life. He always loves to talk about running.

At 58 Romano decided to tackle the world majors. He had run the NYC Marathon but he wasn't trying to be competitive. He didn't start running until he was in his 30s. Once he realized that long distances suited him better he hired a coach and started to really work on his training.

Romano's motto is ""You gotta stay in the fight"" based on his 90-year-old mother. She has gone through so many challenges in her life and yet she just keeps going. This is a big motivator for him. In 2019 Romano ran all six marathon majors in one calendar year at an average time of 3 hours and 15 minutes. He was one of only 19 people to do it that year -- and only 82 people have ever completed their six-star journey in one calendar year.

Romano ran Berlin in September this year and will run New York on Sunday with a goal of finishing sub 3:30.

Edna Kiplagat age 42

""Let's go Mom!"" This is what Edna Kiplagat hears throughout her long training runs in Longmont Colorado as her husband drives alongside her with her kids in the back cheering.

No matter the race they're supporting her during her running journey. Kiplagat grew up in Iten Kenya and started out playing soccer before switching to track. Kiplagat was already running faster than her peers and this was obvious in middle school. She started qualifying for international races at a young age.

""Running doesn't come without lots of training and working hard"" Kiplagat says though she adds that the best athletes find happiness joy and excitement from their sport. Kiplagat feels this way about running.

She won her first major marathon in New York City in 2010 and since then has won two of the other majors -- London in 2014 and Boston in 2017. She is also a two-time gold medalist in the marathon at the world athletics championships and will be returning to New York to race on Sunday.

Gilbert Koech is her husband as well as her coach. They work together and plan for months to make sure she's ready for race day.

""Eating a healthy diet staying hydrated getting enough sleep and seeing the big picture are all important components to being marathon ready"" she says ""To have a good experience you need to be prepared.""

Manuela Schär won three consecutive NYC Marathon titles from 2017-2019. Eric Canha-USA TODAY Sports

Manuela Schär age 37

An accident at 8 years old forced Manuela Schär to look for a sport that would replace running. She started wheelchair racing when she was 11 years old -- and hasn't looked back.

Switzerland has a long and storied history in wheelchair racing and Schär is a part of it. She won seven marathon majors in a row in 2018 and 2019 and has a PR of 1:28:17 for the distance. In Tokyo last year she won the gold medal for the 400 and 800 meters in the Paralympic Games.

Schär loves traveling and the marathon distance and she appreciates all of the challenges that the different majors throw at her. ""To be the total athlete"" she says ""You have to be good at both the flats and the downhill sections of the course.""

The Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division in 1975 and now it has become a standard event at every major marathon.

""It's really special that wheelchair racing is included in the Abbott World Marathon Majors"" Schär says. ""This gives these athletes a world stage and more possibilities from sponsorships to the ability to be a role model. Including wheelchair racing in these events helps support the future of the sport.""

Schär will aim to win her fourth NYC Marathon on Sunday -- she won three in a row from 2017-2019.

The van Hunsel family completed their sixth marathon in Boston in April. Lorna Campbell

Rene Dirk and Gijs van Hunsel ages 65 37 and 33 respectively

One marathon turned into six for Rene and his sons Dirk and Gijs. Rene has been running for 50 years through five small villages in the Netherlands. In 2007 he ran his first marathon. In 2012 all three of the van Hunsels signed up to run the New York City Marathon together but Hurricane Sandy hit and the event was canceled.

A year later they finally were able to run in New York. They joke that they still don't know why they sign up year after year to wake up at 6 a.m. then wait three hours in cold weather to run with thousands of people.

""Training for a marathon is healthy but running the marathon isn't"" Rene says. ""I enjoy the distance because it's just a little too far for me so I feel accomplished when I finish.""

The van Hunsels like to motivate each other during training. They don't live close to each other in the Netherlands so they can't run together as much as they would like to. But they make it work.

""When I found out my dad ran more kilometers than me [one] week Gijs and I felt we needed to catch up"" Dirk jokes.

When they heard about the marathon majors they decided to run all six races. But it was a challenge getting all three of them into every race. They would enter the lottery or use a tour operator to get in while Rene typically qualified into his age group based on his times.

In April they completed their sixth marathon in Boston to receive their six-star medals. As a family running together the van Hunsels stood out -- and they said the cheers they received made them feel like celebrities.

Ciaran Diviney age 50

After taking a 20-year break from running Ciaran Diviney decided to start again. In 2011 he opted to run the Berlin Marathon with a few friends. He completed it in 3:09. ""I caught the running bug"" he says.

When he started training it was more of a solo mission but that quickly changed when he started to run into others on his runs. The following year he met with others who were also training for the Dublin Marathon and they suggested that he join their local athletics running club.

This changed his life. He met the love of his life Ciara at the running club and they now have a family with two young boys. Diviney self-trains and does about 70-80 miles a week with a marathon PR of 2:35:30.

He didn't start out to complete all of the marathon majors but the more he learned about it the more he wanted to. ""[They] have that element of prestige about them. Then I realized that this is something I could complete and it became a milestone that I was looking forward to.""

He has now run 15 marathons -- and even ran the Dublin Marathon last Saturday before flying across the ocean and lacing up for New York this Sunday. If he completes NYC he'll earn his sixth star finisher medal.

Jennifer Solomon has completed the six major marathons then took it one step further: She ran a marathon on seven continents in seven days. Jannelle Cioffi

Jennifer Solomon age 49

Jennifer Solomon was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day until 2008. ""I smoked for about 15 years"" she says. At the age of 40 she decided she needed to change to a healthier lifestyle. She quit smoking and when she began to gain weight she started running.

She had never considered herself to be an athlete. As a single mom with three children she didn't have much time for herself but she had just enough time for running.

Solomon started with 5K races before opting to run the Manchester City Marathon in New Hampshire in 2014 and the Boston Marathon in 2018 as a charity runner for Boston Children's Hospital.

""As a grown-up I feel like we have such few things that we do that we can be proud of ourselves for"" Solomon says. ""Every training cycle and race came with that rush of finishing. I just loved that feeling.""

Solomon completed all six marathon majors in 12 months in 2019. She ran with charity bibs for five of the majors and raised $60000 for children's charities. It became something she did just for herself -- and she didn't mind that her kids would brag about her marathons to their friends.

""Don't stop until you're proud"" she would think to herself.

After each race Solomon was always on a flight home the next day to see her children. Then after she finished all the world marathon majors she kept going: In February of 2020 she ran the World Marathon Challenge -- running a marathon on seven continents in seven days.

""Truth be told it was hard and in hindsight I'm not sure how I pulled it all together. I think if I thought of everything in totality I would've been scared off so I just planned for the week ahead.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA0L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXN0YXItc2hlcnlsLWxlZS1yYWxwaC1zYXlzLWJleW9uY2Utc2VudC1oZXItZmxvd2Vycy1hZnRlci1lbW15LXdpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Abbott Elementary' star Sheryl Lee Ralph says Beyoncé sent her flowers after Emmy win,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA0L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXN0YXItc2hlcnlsLWxlZS1yYWxwaC1zYXlzLWJleW9uY2Utc2VudC1oZXItZmxvd2Vycy1hZnRlci1lbW15LXdpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1672560>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzA0L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXN0YXItc2hlcnlsLWxlZS1yYWxwaC1zYXlzLWJleW9uY2Utc2VudC1oZXItZmxvd2Vycy1hZnRlci1lbW15LXdpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tLzEwLWxpZmUtbGVzc29ucy1hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS10YXVnaHQtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Life Lessons 'Abbott Elementary' Taught Us,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tLzEwLWxpZmUtbGVzc29ucy1hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS10YXVnaHQtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1412710>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tLzEwLWxpZmUtbGVzc29ucy1hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS10YXVnaHQtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The planning and zoning commission is to meet at 7 p.m. at the Hilliard Municipal Building 3800 Municipal Way.

To be known as TruePointe Equity is proposing a final development plan consisting of 11 building lots 359 multifamily dwelling units in five buildings a 6-story parking garage with 616 spaces and a second 6-story parking garage with 708 spaces on 28 acres.

“(TruePointe) will change the face of Hilliard” Steve Wathen CEO of Equity told ThisWeek News July 19.

The Hilliard Planning and Zoning Commission on July 14 unanimously recommended approval of modification to the existing planned unit development zoning to allow for a mixed-use development that includes restaurants hotels and residential uses.

Hilliard City Council on Aug. 22 approved the commission’s recommendation.

“We expect to start going vertical (with beginning the foundations of buildings) sometime in May (2023)” Wathen said.

The $100 million-plus mixed-use development encompassing more than 300000 square feet of office space and hotels and more than 45000 square feet of retail is to be complete in about two years from the start of construction according to Wathen.

The original PUD was approved in 1998 and called only for office space owing to its frontage along I-270 but that is no longer tenable in today’s market according to John Talentino a city planner. The PUD modification adds residential restaurants and hotels as permitted uses.

TruePointe is also to include medical offices.

The scheme is being run by the Dog's Trust and there are several pooches who would love to find a for-now-family this winter while the charity faces a busy period.

Dog's Trust Home from Home connects dogs with foster carers who would love to have a dog in their life but who can’t commit to owning a dog of their own. The trust in Basildon is searching for people who fit the bill and has a number of gorgeous dogs who are in need of a temporary home.

The fostering scheme finds temporary homes for dogs that need a little extra TLC and time out from the hustle and bustle of the rehoming centre including young puppies older dogs and those with medical conditions. The foster homes need to be one where someone is around for most of the day with no young children.

The foster home should be no more than an hour away from the centre in Wickford. Volunteer foster carers are provided with everything they need such as dog food bedding and toys and the charity will cover the cost of any necessary vet bills. They are also supported by the Dogs Trust team for guidance and advice.

Mr Blue Sky

This five-year-old lurcher is a sweet and affectionate boy who is looking for a quiet and understanding home as he can be fearful of meeting new people but once he knows you he is a very cuddly boy. Mr Blue Sky must have an adult only home and his new family will need to commit to multiple visits to Dogs Trust Basildon to get to know his quirky personality before going home.

Mr Blue can be left for short periods once he has settled into his new home. Due to his high chase drive he needs to wear his muzzle and kept on lead when out and about on adventures. As he loves to zoom around with his favourite toys Mr Blue must have access to a private and secure garden in his new home.

One of Mr Blue's carer's Alice says ""he is such a sweet boy who loves a fuss and a snuggle once he gets to know you! He will even try to squeeze himself on your lap"". Find out more about how to foster Mr Blue Sky here.

Text description provided by the architects. dongqi Design has managed to interpret the brand spirit of Estée Lauder Companies by using architectural language in the ELC pavilion II at the China International Import Expo (CIIE).

The pavilion was a cube from the outside being divided into separate areas inside to display ELC’s corporate culture and the 19 brands. The overall layout which was developed from a grid system turned out to be a dynamic one with rounded corners after deliberate discussions. The size and position of each area met the needs of each brand. The exhibit route was carefully designed to connect each band area and to make sure a rich experience for the visitors.

The whole partition system which was the essential part of the spatial form was cut into two parts vertically with the translucent acrylic part on the top and the transparent part on the bottom. The partition system was composed of vertical acrylic fins which were arranged with a gradient change of angles generated by a certain algorithm. The sections of the translucent acrylic fins get larger from bottom to top. When people move through the pavilion they would experience the change of the lights and shadows of the bottom part of the acrylic walls while the variety of shapes and sizes of the upper part at the same time. The atmosphere was changing all the time. One can feel open and shining as if he was in a crystal garden in one moment and feel narrow and serene as if he was in a deep forest when turns a corner.

The architects were deeply collaborating with steel structure engineers during the whole design period. The idea was to make the structural system visually invisible to the full extent on the premise of structural security. The steel columns were designed long and flat to approach the shape and size of the acrylic fins. They were also arranged with certain angles on the plan in order to be integrated into the acrylic partition system. Meanwhile the structural performance was enhanced. The steel beams and columns were coated with a mirror finish to conceal the volume and to be light and graceful like the acrylic walls.

The design language of the acrylic wall system was also applied to each brand area especially the display fixtures. After a close discussion with the team of ELC materials were chosen respectively to build the display fixture according to the tonality of each brand. For instance black mirror-finished stainless steel and mirror-finished stainless steel were used as a pair to echo the temperament of one of the brands. The lighting design was not only considered functionally to meet the needs of visual merchandising designers but narratively as well to highlight the atmosphere.

When observed from a distance the pavilion was just like a pure crystal with thousands of facets each of which reflected back its own tone and color fusing the whole environment and family members together. The delicacy of transparent acrylic together with the softness of translucent acrylic demonstrated the definition of beauty given by ELC which is: to be tender and wise delicate and graceful. The pureness of the acrylic cube tolerated and included everything. It also went well with the theme of the ELC CIIE II: Made of prestige.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RvbS1mb3JkLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWtlcmluZy1wdWxscy1haGVhZC1vZi1lc3QtZS1sYXVkZXItMjA0Njc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Ford acquisition: Kering pulls ahead of Estée Lauder,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RvbS1mb3JkLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWtlcmluZy1wdWxscy1haGVhZC1vZi1lc3QtZS1sYXVkZXItMjA0Njc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1D90400>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RvbS1mb3JkLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWtlcmluZy1wdWxscy1haGVhZC1vZi1lc3QtZS1sYXVkZXItMjA0Njc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC1jb25zdW1lci9rZXJpbmctc2hhcmVzLXVwLXJlcG9ydC1jb21wYW55LXNlZWtzLWJ1eS10b20tZm9yZC0yMDIyLTExLTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kering shares up on report company seeks to buy Tom Ford,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/kering-shares-up-report-company-seeks-buy-tom-ford-2022-11-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC1jb25zdW1lci9rZXJpbmctc2hhcmVzLXVwLXJlcG9ydC1jb21wYW55LXNlZWtzLWJ1eS10b20tZm9yZC0yMDIyLTExLTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9jb3VsZC10b20tZm9yZC1raWNrc3RhcnQta2VyaW5ncy1pbi1ob3VzZS1iZWF1dHktYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Tom Ford kickstart Kering's in-house beauty business?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9jb3VsZC10b20tZm9yZC1raWNrc3RhcnQta2VyaW5ncy1pbi1ob3VzZS1iZWF1dHktYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1D93250>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9jb3VsZC10b20tZm9yZC1raWNrc3RhcnQta2VyaW5ncy1pbi1ob3VzZS1iZWF1dHktYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbmlzdGEuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvc2VyZ2lvLWh1ZHNvbi1idXNpbmVzcy1pbnRlcnZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Must Read: Sergio Hudson's Path to an American Fashion Empire Kering Reportedly in Talks to Aquire Tom Ford,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='fashionista.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/11/sergio-hudson-business-interview (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1D910F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbmlzdGEuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvc2VyZ2lvLWh1ZHNvbi1idXNpbmVzcy1pbnRlcnZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Up until now the only way to search on Etsy was through keywords. Now users on iOS can tap the new camera icon in the search bar and upload or take a photo after which Etsy will surface items that are visually similar to the image the user shared. Etsy says it plans to expand image search to Android app users soon.

The company says the new feature aims to help users discover items when they have trouble finding the right words to define a specific product. For example say you’re looking for a mug in your favorite color but don’t know how to describe the exact shade you want. Or you see a unique piece of furniture and want to find a small business that can hand-make something similar for you. The new image search feature should help you find what you’re looking for in instances like these.

“With more than 100 million items in our marketplace odds are that if you can dream it — or snap a photo of it — you’ll find something you love on Etsy” the company said in a blog post. “We’re always investing in our marketplace to make it easier for sellers to grow their businesses. We’re excited for this new innovative feature to make it easier for sellers to get discovered and connect with our built-in base of nearly 90 million buyers around the world.”

Etsy says the new feature was developed as part of CodeMosaic which is an annual Etsy Hackathon that gives engineers opportunities to try out new skills while building creative solutions.

The launch of Etsy’s new feature comes as platforms like Google and Pinterest have had image search capabilities for quite some time now. Google recently added updates to its multisearch feature that lets users combine a photo and text to craft custom searches initially around shopping. The search giant also added its Lens image search right into its home page this week letting users access the advanced image recognition tool directly from the search box.

Etsy released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday and reported a revenue bump of 11.7% over the same quarter of 2021 to $594.5 million. The bump was likely partially due to the platform’s increased transaction fee from 5% to 6.5%. The change saw sellers go on strike earlier this year after the fee increase was announced. Etsy had noted on its website that the increased fee supported its plans to make “significant investments in marketing seller tools and creating a world-class customer experience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tLzEwLW1vdmllcy1hbmQtYm9va3MtYnktaW5kaWdlbm91cy1jcmVhdG9ycy02ODI1NDYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Movies and Books by Indigenous Creators to Add to Your List,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.realsimple.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /10-movies-and-books-by-indigenous-creators-6825460 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF12A4310>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tLzEwLW1vdmllcy1hbmQtYm9va3MtYnktaW5kaWdlbm91cy1jcmVhdG9ycy02ODI1NDYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvZXRzeS1nYWlucy13aGlsZS1yb2t1LXF1YWxjb21tLTE4MzQzMTU0Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Etsy gains while Roku and Qualcomm sink - Our lukewarm takes on their earnings,"(“What’s a lukewarm take?” you ask – well it’s definitely not a hot take – we would like to think it’s a more considered insightful and useful take on the news.)

This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News

Key Takeaways from This Analysis:

Roku’s increase in streaming hours will eventually lead to increased revenue.

Etsy is performing well given the pressure on consumer discretionary budgets.

Qualcomm’s dividend seems to be safe for now.

Roku has now given up 775% of gains since 2019

Roku’s ( Nasdaq: ROKU ) share price fell to a new 52-week low after the company warned that revenue will be sharply lower than previously expected during the current quarter. The share price has now given up all its gains since February 2019 which at one point amounted to 775%

Revenue for the third quarter was $761 mln up 12% from a year ago and well ahead of consensus estimates - although those estimates have been lowered significantly over the last few months. On a GAAP basis the company lost $0.88 a share which was also much better than expected but compared to positive $0.52 a year ago.

Total net revenue for the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $800 mln versus estimates of $884 mln (that were closer to $1.2 bln a few months ago).

Our take: There wasn’t much to like about these results and the immediate future looks bleak. However there was one metric that is encouraging and worth keeping an eye on going forward.

During the last quarter

Active users increased 16% YoY to 65.4 million

Total hours streamed increased 21% YoY to 21.9 billion

The average revenue per user increased 10% YoY to $44.25

The increase in active users isn't very exciting and the increase in ARPU was disappointing. But the total hours streamed continues to rise and it's been rising all year despite the end of lockdown restrictions.

Ad spending is under pressure at the moment so Roku has obviously struggled to monetize the increase in viewing hours. But the total number of streaming hours will be important when ad spend does begin to increase again. As consumers switch from cable TV to streaming services advertisers have limited options - and Roku is one of those options.

Our full analysis of ROKU provides a more comprehensive picture of the company’s financials and several risks to be aware of.

Etsy is doing well given the current environment

Shares of Etsy ( Nasdaq: ETSY ) traded as much as 16% higher on Thursday after the e-commerce platform announced better-than-expected sales and raised guidance. Gross merchandise value of $3 billion was down 3.3% YoY while revenue of $594 mln was 11.7% higher than a year ago. The net loss widened to $963 mln due to an impairment charge.

The good news came in the form of guidance for the fourth quarter as the company expects GMV to increase to between $3.6 and $4 bln.

Revenue rose while gross merchandise sales were flat. This was partly a result of raising the commission Esty charges on transactions but also due to additional services it provides to customers.

Our take: Etsy’s GMV revenue and net income have been relatively flat over the last two years. The jump in the share price was a response to the company beating very low expectations.

But Etsy did provide some encouraging data which shows that the company is building a loyal customer base.

Nasdaq: ETSY KPIs - Company presentation

These numbers suggest that customers are more engaged but are now spending less on each transaction. This makes sense when we consider the effect of inflation on discretionary budgets.

Etsy is a unique platform with a loyal customer base. It's probably going to struggle to grow in the current economic environment but will be a company to watch when conditions change.

Have a look at the full analysis of Etsy for more details.

Qualcomm sinks on falling smartphone demand

Qualcomm ( Nasdaq: QCOM ) reported mixed results but also lowered guidance for the current quarter. The share price fell 7.45% in response and it's now down 25% over the last 12 months and 43% year to date.

Quarterly sales of $11.4 bln were up 22.1% from a year ago and ahead of consensus estimates. Non-GAAP EPS were also up 22% to $ 3.13 which is what analysts expected. GAAP EPS were lower than expected and only 3.8% higher than a year ago.

The company now expects first-quarter revenue of $9.2 to $10 bln compared to the previous estimate of 12.05 bln. The company also said that smartphone demand was falling and that customers are drawing down on inventory as supply chain restraints have eased.

Our take: Qualcomm stands out amongst its peers due to its strong cash flows and 2.9% dividend yield. The company has managed to increase its dividend every year for the last decade - but you may be wondering how sustainable it is if the company experiences an ongoing slowdown.

The payout ratio is currently 24% of earnings and 49% of cash flow. Free cash flow has already fallen quite a lot over the last year - but the dividend coverage still appears to be sustainable. It would take a very dramatic drop in cash flow to put the current yield at risk.

Etsy has launched a new feature on the iOS app enabling users to search for unique items by an image on the marketplace.

With the new image search feature shoppers can better describe what they’re looking for with images rather than keywords which until now has been the fastest way to find items on Etsy.

The new image search feature is simple to use. Users tap the new camera icon in the search bar in the Etsy app upload or take a photo and the app will find items that are visually similar to the image provided.

“We know that buyers often seek shopping inspiration outside of the marketplace then turn to Etsy to discover items and make purchases. But sometimes they have trouble finding the right words to find the perfect items” said Han Cho product lead responsible for Etsy’s buyer-facing iOS and Android apps.

The new image search feature was developed as part of CodeMosaic Etsy’s annual Hackathon which enables engineers to showcase creative ideas and solutions to benefit the Etsy platform and community.

Cho said the new feature showed encouraging results in early testing enabling the company to launch it to all iOS users as a beta now.

Etsy will continue to develop the image search as more shoppers use it to explore the more than 90 million items on the marketplace further improving the experience.

Also the company “hope[s] to expand image search to Android app user soon” but didn’t provide details if developers are actively working on the Android version or when users could expect to see it.

Etsy Image Search Could Help Sellers Improve Sales

Image search is a great function and has worked well on other platforms such as eBay and Google if sellers create images to help the technology narrow results.

While the holy grail of image search would be for the technology to automatically identify the focused object (item) it’s advisable to make the product stand out to achieve the best results.

In other words sellers should ensure that their primary product image is clutter free and identifiable against a near-solid background.

Even before the new image search feature Etsy’s product photography guide recommended using a “seamless background.” With the new image search this best practice for product images is even more important.

While the Etsy guide also discusses placing products into a contextual setting primary product images are always best when they clearly highlight the item.

Following Etsy’s product photo guidelines should improve image search results for shoppers and hopefully increase sales for sellers putting in the effort to display their products visually.

Secondary Benefit for Sellers

Another benefit for sellers of the new image search feature could be the ability to identify infringing listings and report them to Etsy for action.

By searching for items visually on the app sellers can more easily find sellers including resellers offering their products or designs without authorization.

For sellers not familiar with the process Etsy explains how to handle and report potentially infringing items in its help section here.

So while the image search is designed to help buyers find products on Etsy a side benefit is that sellers may just got a new tool to identify and report infringing sellers more easily.

According to the announcement this move is another step forward in Everest’s ambitions and execution of its long-term strategic plan outlined last year to the investment community.

It is the product of exhaustive research to develop a brand positioning that speaks directly to Everest’s values and stakeholders as well as the company’s long-standing commitment to giving back through philanthropic efforts and volunteerism on both a global and local scale the reinsurer added.

Juan C. Andrade President and Chief Executive Officer of Everest commented: “There has never been a more exciting time to be part of the Everest community and today that pride is palpable among our global colleagues who inspired our brand and shape our company’s future.

“From the reimagined mountain to the digitally optimised logo and design system our refreshed brand honours Everest’s core values growth and strong performance in a contemporary reflection of who we are where we are headed and our mission to provide protection and opportunity in an increasingly complex risk environment.”

According to the announcement the colours and typography in Everest’s new visual identity were purposefully designed to mirror the diversity of its stakeholders and the digital-first world.

The modernised “E” in the new logo is a nod to the company’s legacy mountain imagery which is symbolic of its more than 50-year history of strength stability and endurance. Everest’s new “signature blue” is described as a vibrant shade designed to optimise screen-based digital communications.

Additionally the brand’s future-forward typeface Avenir Next is recognized globally for its humanist features and was chosen to reflect the company’s reputation for transparency and trust resulting in long-standing customer and partner relationships.

Andrade concluded: “Never before has the work we do been more consequential making this the perfect moment to unveil our brand evolution. It comes at a pivotal time for our company and stakeholders as Everest continues to diversify and progress as a top performing investor and customer platform in the P&C market.

“We are expanding our primary insurance business to benefit more people and places worldwide while simultaneously building on our position as a preeminent global reinsurance leader and preferred partner. Our ability to consistently deliver outstanding service and unmatched risk solutions coupled with our strong inclusive culture sets Everest apart. While modelling risk is the core of our business humanity is the spirit that drives it. We are proud of how our refreshed brand brings this powerful value proposition to life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjMtZm9yZC1ldmVyZXN0LW5vdC1jb21pbmctdG8tdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 2023 Ford Everest Is A Ranger-Based SUV Not On Sale In The US,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjMtZm9yZC1ldmVyZXN0LW5vdC1jb21pbmctdG8tdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF228DBA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjMtZm9yZC1ldmVyZXN0LW5vdC1jb21pbmctdG8tdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8va2F0aG1hbmR1cG9zdC5jb20vMzkvMjAyMi8xMS8wNS9wYW5kaHJhdW4tY2h1bGktYS1maXJzdGhhbmQtYWNjb3VudC1vZi1hLW5lcGFsaS1zdXJ2ZXlvci1zLWV2ZXJlc3Qtc3VtbWl0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A firsthand account of a Nepali surveyor's Everest summits,Dahal is the founding president of the Himalayan Institute of Tourism Education and Development and also the co-author of ‘Tourism in Nepal’.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWd5b25saW5lLmNhLzIwMjIvMTEvMDQvMjAyMi1zbWFsbC1hZ2VuY3ktYW95LWdvbGQtYWxsLXN0YXItc3RyYXRlZ2ljLWxlZC10YWxlbnQta2VlcHMtYnJva2VuLWhlYXJ0LWxvdmUtYWZmYWlyLXB1bmNoaW5nLWFib3ZlLWl0cy13ZWlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Small Agency AOY Gold: All-star strategic-led talent keeps Broken Heart Love Affair punching above its weight,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://strategyonline.ca/2022/11/04/2022-small-agency-aoy-gold-all-star-strategic-led-talent-keeps-broken-heart-love-affair-punching-above-its-weight/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWd5b25saW5lLmNhLzIwMjIvMTEvMDQvMjAyMi1zbWFsbC1hZ2VuY3ktYW95LWdvbGQtYWxsLXN0YXItc3RyYXRlZ2ljLWxlZC10YWxlbnQta2VlcHMtYnJva2VuLWhlYXJ0LWxvdmUtYWZmYWlyLXB1bmNoaW5nLWFib3ZlLWl0cy13ZWlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

It was first announced in 2019 and now on Friday Rhode Island and East Providence officials and Live Nation New England kick off one of the biggest economic investments ever along the Seekonk River.

The move by East Providence is the latest in the transformation of the waterfront.

The development comes after a series of projects that are leveraging the city’s location and miles of undeveloped waterfront.

The entertainment venue is planned to include an outdoor amphitheater parking and new amenities for warm-weather events. The venue will be booked by Live Nation.

In addition the City of East Providence has placed a strong emphasis on the positive economic impact of the waterfront concerts at Bold Point Park and will begin new improvements at the park including a kayak launch walking paths and new lighting.

Concerts and Wind Development

The prospective site is a new mixed-use development with plans to also serve as a deepwater port for Rhode Island’s growing offshore wind industry.

RI Waterfront Enterprises LLC the new parcel owner has planned a unique mixed-use model to meet two objectives: helping connect the people of East Providence to the waterfront and serving the port needs of the offshore wind industry. The entertainment venue will reportedly be for warm-weather events from May to September.

GoLocal's architecture critic Will Morgan wrote about East Providence's development  ""Rhode Island's fifth-largest city East Providence stretches from Rumford to Riverside from piedmont to bay with remarkably varied topography and several ""village"" centers. While historic and affordable (all the access and half the taxes) it is terra incognita to most East Siders. When the wealthy come to Providence in search of a home can you imagine a broker from one of the prestige real estate firms saying Have you thought of East Providence? Perception and prejudice aside East Providence may be the best remedy for the East Side pricing paradigm.""

""Live music among other benefits helps to attract tourists to cities and contributes to a thriving cultural environment. In East Providence a strong emphasis has been placed on the positive economic impact of the waterfront concerts at Bold Point Park. The City is enjoying renewed interest in key areas of economic development including job growth consumer spending and real estate development"" said the announcement of the new project.

The City of East Providence and the East Providence Waterfront Commission partnered with RI Waterfront Enterprises to bring this 45-acre mixed-use development project to fruition. Mayor Bob DaSilva said “It was important for the City to champion this project because it adds to our City’s commercial tax base as well as solidifies the State of Rhode Island’s commitment to green energy and its position at the forefront of offshore wind energy.”

The East Providence Waterfront Commission charged with facilitating the transformation of the East Providence waterfront will be instrumental in streamlining the approval process. The parcel known as the South Quay was previously owned by Providence and Worcester Railroad and sat unoccupied and was mostly unused for the past 40 years. William Fazioli chairman of the Commission said at the time of the announcement “We are encouraged by the expansion of the successful Bold Point concert series within our Waterfront District. This proposal advances our goals for a vibrant mixed-use development that will grow jobs and increase public access to our City’s waterfront.”

Dropbox Google Drive and OneDrive dominate the mainstream market so we took a look at this top three and a deep dive into their special features. Which one will work for your workflow?

Dropbox

Dropbox has been around for a while. In the end it brought cloud storage to the mainstream in the first place. Let’s look at some of its top features when it comes to storage.



Office 365 and Workspace. Dropbox offers a different set of tools depending on its purpose. These tools are specifically designed either for personal use or for businesses looking to migrate their platform in to Dropbox. Office 365 and Google Workspace are great examples of these tools. You can easily share documents and work collaboratively with your colleagues in real-time. The only hurdle here is that you need to have a matching Google account (Gmail account) and Dropbox username. Otherwise you can’t integrate these applications together.



Dropbox Rewind. We have all accidentally deleted something that we shouldn’t have. This tool allows you to recover accidentally deleted or edited files up to 30 days after or even 180 days with a paid subscription. You only need to know the date and time of the deleted file and Rewind can restore it for you.



Smart Sync. With the integrated third-party office tool you can keep your hard drive storage in check and block-level transfers. You can choose which files are stored both locally and in the cloud or just in one or the other. This becomes handy when you have devices with limited storage space. This is a pretty rare feature to have.



Mobile version. Very easy to use. You can easily upload files create photos and scan documents with your phone. You can also access Microsoft Office to use Word Excel and PowerPoint to create documents.



Speed. Remarkably fast upload and download speeds. Dropbox claims that no compression has been made during the process which leaves us thinking - how?



Privacy. Dropbox keeps its encryption keys on its servers for third-party access.

This means Dropbox staff hackers or someone else might potentially have access to your files. This is the trade-off between integrated tools and security.



Pricing. Not the cheapest but not too expensive. It offers five different subscriptions: Free (up to 2GB) Plus ($11.99/month) Family ($19.99) Business Standard ($18.00) and Business Advanced ($30).

Google Drive

Google needs no introduction. Being the biggest cloud storage provider it offers the best solutions when it comes to productivity.



Google Workspace and other third parties. It works seamlessly with Google Workspace (Google Docs Sheets and Slides). Other apps such as Forms Drawings and Maps can be easily integrated by just right-clicking the menu. You can preview different media files from images and videos to music. It lets you change the playback speed of the video or even add closed captions in the video. Documents in different formats are also easily accessible through the different Workspaces.



Google Keep. This is an easy note-taking app that can be integrated together with Google Calendar and Google Tasks. You can find this in the right-hand taskbar and integrate it with other apps for easy access.



Google Photos. Since Google Drive doesn't automatically back up your photos and videos you need Google Photos for the job. This allows you to store them with the “high quality” setting Google will work its AI magic to compress those files and upload an HD version to Drive to save space from your storage.



Mobile version. Drive works for both Android and iOS offering a lot of the same functionality as the browser version. Downloading the Workspace apps you can preview and edit files in the app with your mobile phone. However you can’t connect third-party apps to it.



Speed. Being one of the biggest storage providers you find their servers pretty much everywhere you go. This doesn’t guarantee the ultimate download speed however. In addition to its average speed Google Drive does not currently offer block-level sync which means the entire file will be re-uploaded even when you are making slight changes. This takes up more time when uploading files.



Privacy. Being a large company has its perks and one of them is security. All files on Drive are encrypted and Google holds all the encryption keys. Same as Dropbox Google has access to these files when needed.



Pricing. Google Drive offers the best free plan out of everyone. All in all it offers seven different subscription options according to the storage space: 15GB (free) 100GB ($1.99/month) 200GB ($2.99/month) 2TB ($9.99/month) 10TB ($49.99/month) 20TB ($99.99/month) and 30TB ($149.99/month).

OneDrive

OneDrive provides great tools for Microsoft users. Its level of integration with services like Office Skype OneNote and Outlook is all in the OneDrive platform. This allows you to create documents and have team calls without having to leave OneDrive.

Personal Vault. To offers something distinctive Onedrive has a ‘personal vault’ where you can store files and access them only with a unique code or fingerprint. It’s an extra feature of security when needed. There is a space limit depending on your subscription model.

File Restore and Files on Demand. Previously limited to OneDrive for Business users Onedrive offers now file restoration to all users with a paid OneDrive or Microsoft 365 subscription. To make the most out of your subscription account Files on Demand makes sure to keep files in the cloud to free up space on their hard drive. This gives you the option to download and access files only when you need them.

Built-In Image Scanner. Some businesses are keen on using QR codes and having a built-in scanner makes working very efficient. With this feature you can scan documents business cards and photos quickly and easily by just tapping the screen.

Mobile version. OneDrive for mobile is available for both Android and iOS. It comes with most of the same features as desktop applications. The mobile apps for OneDrive give you the option to automatically upload the photos and videos that you take which is great for backup.

Speed. OneDrive is fairly impressive when it comes to uploading and downloading. Despite not being as fast as Dropbox it supports block-level file copying for quick editing without extra delays when fully uploading them again.

Privacy. OneDrive just like the others is not a zero-knowledge provider meaning it can access users’ encryption keys. OneDrive offers an automated notification service that notifies you if someone has accessed your files. You can use any connected device to restore compromised files change your password and activate additional OneDrive security features.

Pricing. Let’s put it simply: the more you pay the more you get. OneDrive has the most subscriptions plans: OneDrive Basic 5GB (free) OneDrive 100GB ($1.99/month) Microsoft 365 Personal ($6.99/month) Microsoft 365 Business Basic ($7.20/month) Microsoft 365 Family ($9.99/month) OneDrive for Business Plan 1 ($5.00/month) OneDrive for Business Plan 2 ($10.00/month) and Microsoft 365 Business Standard($15.00/month).

Final verdict?

All of these cloud storage providers are great but choose the one best for your needs. If you are looking for a free plan go for Google Drive. It offers the largest storage space without extra cost. If you are looking for extra privacy when it comes to your data none of these are fully safe but OneDrive does offer more features for privacy. If you are collaborating with others and you are looking to download files quickly in no time probably choose Dropbox for the extra speed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1raW5kbGUtMjAyMi1yZXZpZXctMzIyNDYyOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Kindle (2022) review: The e-reader that belongs in your pocket,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.androidauthority.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /amazon-kindle-2022-review-3224628/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1D051E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1raW5kbGUtMjAyMi1yZXZpZXctMzIyNDYyOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In October 2022 prices for battery grade lithium carbonate in China hit an all-time high of $74475 per tonne eclipsing the record set just a month prior.1 Lithium pricing trends are deeply rooted in the transportation segment’s ongoing shift toward electrification. In recent years accommodative government policy declining costs consumer preference and technological improvement have supported rapidly increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). So far lithium supply upgrades have not kept pace with this surge in demand. As a result we expect the lithium market balance to tilt toward a supply deficit for several years presenting opportunities for the mining companies that dictate supply.

Key Takeaways

Surging demand for EVs and the inelastic nature of lithium supply are the primary drivers behind the increase in lithium prices in 2022.

Supply is unlikely to grow in lockstep with demand through the first half of the decade likely generating deficits that could support elevated lithium pricing.

Elevated lithium pricing has generally translated into strong results for lithium miners in recent quarters including Albemarle SQM and Ganfeng.

EV Sales and Inelastic Supply Likely to Support Lithium Prices

Lithium prices have surged 123% year-to-date and are up as much as 10x versus historical levels according to the Benchmark Minerals Intelligence lithium price index.2 As momentum accelerated toward EVs in recent years so too did aggregate demand for lithium. On average the lithium-ion battery packs found in EVs contain about 9kg of lithium thousands of times more than most consumer electronics.3 Global EV sales doubled from 3.3 million units to 6.6 million units between 2020 and 2021 and are expected to increase by another 52% in 2022.4

Meanwhile lithium miners have been unable to scale supply as rapidly. Depending on the method of extraction bringing new capacity online can take 3–5 years or more.5 This time is needed to conduct studies secure permitting raise capital and deploy capital before any lithium is produced. As such it is challenging for miners to react quickly to rising demand without considerable preemptive efforts.

Historically miners have also been hesitant to boost production fearing what flooding the market with supply could do to lithium prices. This scenario occurred between 2015 and 2018 when miners hiked lithium production in anticipation of rapid EV sales growth in the immediate term. This speculation turned out to be premature leading to lithium price volatility during that period. We believe the current favorable lithium pricing environment and now well-established EV adoption trends have made miners more inclined to commit to ramp future capacity.

Market Balance Forecasts: Lithium Demand to Outpace Supply Through 2025

Annual lithium demand is projected to reach roughly 1.5 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2025 and over 3 million tons by 2030.6 This 2025 forecast calls for triple the demand seen in 2021.7 EVs could account for about 84% of total lithium demand in 2030 up from about 55% in 2021.8 Consumer electronics energy storage and other industrial applications are likely to account for the balance of demand. Over the longer run demand for lithium is forecast to far exceed the scale of the industry’s capacity today. More lithium could be needed on a monthly basis in 2040 than all of the lithium mined in 2021.9

Lithium supply is likely to lag lithium demand through the first half of the decade. In the short term notable lithium mining capacity is set to come online in late 2023 and early 2024.10 These new projects could cut into the deficit in 2023 but surging EV sales are expected to result in sizeable shortages again in 2024 and 2025.11 By 2025 EVs could account for more than 20% of global light duty vehicles sales up from 9% in 2021.12 This degree of EV adoption is expected to hold lithium prices in ranges comparable to 2022 levels until the market stabilizes around 2026 according to miner Sigma Lithium and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.13 Likewise even after more projects bring resources to market later in the decade lithium prices could remain above historical averages.14

Solid Earnings and Guidance Encouraging Miners to Boost Future Supplies

Elevated lithium prices have boosted the top and bottom lines for relevant miners. Albemarle one of the top suppliers of lithium issued guidance in Q2 2022 that recognized lithium prices could increase 225–250% for fiscal year (FY) 2022 which could correspond to 5x year-over-year (YoY) earnings per share (EPS) growth.15 Similarly Chilean lithium producer Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile (SQM) reported that Q2 2022 revenue more than doubled year over year.16

Along with strong earnings outcomes several prominent lithium miners recently announced capacity expansion ambitions:

Albemarle: During a Q3 2022 U.S. processing plant announcement Albemarle unveiled a goal to increase overall lithium capacity fivefold to 500000 tonnes by 2030. 17

During a Q3 2022 U.S. processing plant announcement Albemarle unveiled a goal to increase overall lithium capacity fivefold to 500000 tonnes by 2030. SQM: In Q2 2022 SQM announced a lithium carbonate production goal of 210000 tonnes by early 2023 more than double 2021 levels. 1819

In Q2 2022 SQM announced a lithium carbonate production goal of 210000 tonnes by early 2023 more than double 2021 levels. Ganfeng: In Q3 2021 Ganfeng announced a plan to boost lithium carbonate capacity fivefold to 600000 tonnes on an undefined timeframe.20

Governments trying to build out lithium and EV supply chains are also incentivizing lithium producers to increase capacity. For example Albemarle will receive $149.7 million and Piedmont Lithium $141.7 million in federal grants from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to develop lithium facilities in the United States.21

We view this increased willingness to expand future lithium supplies as a positive development for the EV space with the commitments made now potentially promoting healthier market dynamics in the coming decades. However even with these recent commitments growth in demand for lithium is expected to outpace supply for some time.

Conclusion

The lithium market remains red hot even as broader commodity markets have moderated in the latter stages of 2022. Used in most of the world’s batteries this specialty chemical’s importance to the global economy is likely to continue. The electrification of transportation highlighted by the mass adoption of EVs is the major reason why. For lithium miners we expect strong demand coupled with lithium’s long supply lead times to sustain a favorable pricing environment for a prolonged period.

Top economic experts in the United States have warned of the US economy slipping into a recession in 2023 despite recent numbers from the government that indicate the economy might be on a rebound path following two consecutive quarters of contraction. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have both recently outlined fears of a sharp slowdown in the economy as the central bank continues with an aggressive rate hike policy intended to curb inflation by raising borrowing costs.

Solomon recently said that economic conditions would tighten meaningfully noting that “until you get to that point where you see a change in labor or demand you are going to see central banks continue to move on that trajectory”. Meanwhile Dimon has also echoed these comments noting that excess money was running out for American consumers. Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (NYSE:FIS) and Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD).

“We took advantage of the selloff in the financials sector to add a new position in Redwood Trust Inc. (NYSE:RWT). The company operates as a speciality finance company within the residential mortgage banking and business purpose mortgage banking industries and capitalized as large investment banks shed their mortgage securitization businesses after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Redwood has since expanded to become the industry leader in the distribution of loans through whole loan sales. Additionally its investment portfolio has been very strong historically even in the GFC and its expansion into banking has made it better. We believe that the company’s long-term value creation is substantially underrepresented in its current market price and look forward to it being a high-quality long-term compounder within the portfolio.”

In its Q2 2022 investor letter Polen Capital an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Cushman & Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“U.S.-domiciled Cushman & Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) is one of the largest companies in the commercial real estate brokerage industry a sector that is consolidating as scale has differentiated large competitors from their smaller peers. This has enabled large industry participants such as Cushman & Wakefield to gain significant market share in transactional business lines like leasing brokerage and capital markets while simultaneously building significant outsourcing businesses with contractual revenue streams. We expect the company to continue growing its market share over time as economies of scale also drive gradual improvement in profit margins. Despite this strong outlook Cushman & Wakefield is trading at a mid-single-digit multiple of current-year earnings—a material discount to the broad market and its large brokerage peers. We see this as an opportunity to own a high-quality well-managed company at a bargain price.”

“I purchased shares of AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) prior to its spin-off of Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD). Most people are probably familiar with AT&T. They are a major cellular service provider and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets which include HBO CNN TNT TBS Cartoon Network DC Comics and the Batman content brands and more. At the time of my purchase I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD which now has HBO Max has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings. As a result shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present but we may add to it over time.”

“We added just one new position to the portfolio during the third quarter: PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR). We believe Paccar is a well-managed high-quality global commercial vehicle manufacturer that trades at a low multiple of normalized earnings. Paccar has consistently grown its earnings power via market share gains improved margins and above-average growth of its highly profitable parts and services business. Despite operating in a cyclical industry the company has been profitable for 82 consecutive years while steadily generating higher peak and trough EPS through each successive cycle. We had the opportunity to purchase Paccar at what we believe is an attractive price due to transitory concerns related to Covid-19-induced supply chain pressures elevated cyclical uncertainty and the longer-term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. We believe our long-time horizon provides a significant advantage as we can look through the short-term headwinds and focus more on what Paccar should earn on a mid-cycle basis. Furthermore while we do expect increased commercial vehicle electrification over time we believe the company is well positioned to integrate new propulsion systems to meet customer demands.”

CEO wants to be community leader | Jax Daily Record,"Expect CEO Joe Hinrichs to increase Jacksonville-based CSX Corp.’s profile in its headquarters city.

“We’ve talked about as a leadership team my expectation is that CSX should be very visible and should be very supportive of this community” Hinrichs 55 said Oct. 21 almost a month after he became CEO on Sept. 26.

“It’s where we’re based it’s where our headquarters is. And I look forward to us being able to show that to the community” he said.

“When you had the honor and privilege to hold a leadership position like this it’s part of your responsibility to be a leader in the community and to give back and to show and to help that community. So I feel very strongly about that” Hinrichs said.

He follows CSX CEOs Hunter Harrison and Jim Foote to lead CSX a company known as a strong corporate community contributor.

Harrison backed by the Mantle Ridge hedge fund was brought into the leadership in March 2017 but died in December 2017 succeeded by Foote. Harrison had bought in Foote as COO and likely successor.

Foote supported business and civic efforts including serving on the Jacksonville Civic Council. However his leadership coincided with the coronavirus pandemic which created business and workforce challenges for the railroad industry as well as public and community events.

Foote who retired at 67 also was following through with Harrison’s Precision Scheduled Railroading system that was a major overhaul of CSX’s operations.

Before Harrison the previous CEO was high-profile Michael Ward.

Ward who retired in 2017 remains active in Jacksonville’s civic leadership.

He and his wife Jennifer Glock set up the Michael Ward and Jennifer Glock Foundation.

They have historically supported area organizations and efforts including United Way of Northeast Florida the Jacksonville Symphony the Jacksonville Public Education Fund the University of North Florida and the Hubbard House domestic violence shelter among more.

Hinrichs said he has not had time to focus on community leadership but intends to do so.

“Part of this is I have a lot of learning to do about CSX and the industry” he said.

“I’ve got to spend more time learning the business and getting to know our people upfront early.”

His LinkedIn profile shows Hinrichs with an MBA from Harvard Business School spent 19 years with Dearborn Michigan-based Ford Motor Co. leaving in 2020 as automotive president. He also was with General Motors for nine years from 1989 to 1998.

He said he was actively involved in Southeast Michigan including leadership in United Way March of Dimes Arthritis Foundation Boy Scouts of America and more.

For example he led the 2018-20 United Way for Southeastern Michigan Community Giving Campaign.

“I did one a year because you space them out but it also gave me a chance to learn about that organization” he said.

“I would chair the campaign because you had influence and you had the ability to pull people together.”

Hinrichs said he also served on a CEO “kitchen cabinet” for Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

“I was honored to be a part of that. It was a small group of people like Roger Penske and Mary Barra from GM. I was actually a part of a small group that also helped advise Governor (Gretchen) Whitmer.”

Penske is chairman and founder of Penske Corp. Barra is chair and CEO of General Motors.

CSX is one of four Jacksonville-based companies on the Fortune 500 list of the country’s largest companies based on revenue.

It ranks No. 298 with 2021 revenue of $12.52 billion after No. 238 Fidelity National Financial Inc. and No. 268 Fidelity National Information Services Inc. Landstar System is No. 491.

Hinrichs said CSX board member Steve Halverson retired CEO of The Haskell Co. based in Jacksonville has been a strong proponent of civic leadership.

“He’s been great and very supportive and so I’m looking forward to it” Hinrichs said.

“It’s so gratifying and just so satisfying to be able to give back and to help” he said.",,,,,,,,,

LIME CITY — The Perrysburg Township Trustees approved a tax incentive enterprise zone agreement with First Solar for a 100% tax abatement for 10 years on a new plant to be created in the township.

The income expected to be generated by the project is $11.1 million in new full-time annual employee payroll by May of 2027. It is expected to generate an additional 100 full-time employees in the township.

Wood County Economic Development Development Commission Director Wade Gottschalk made a presentation on the tax abatement at the regular township trustees meeting on Wednesday.

“I have good news from a long time good corporate citizen First Solar. While they have done their last two recent projects in Lake Township they are looking to do their next project in Perrysburg Township” Gottschalk said. “The 1.5 million-square-foot facility is going to be predominantly research and development with a little bit of warehousing and production space.

“It will be the largest solar manufacturing campus outside mainland China” Gottschalk said.

The tax abatement was approved because of the contribution to the general economic welfare improvement for the township Wood County and the State of Ohio and tax exemption is expected to begin in 2025.

Construction cost for the new research and development center is budgeted at $210 million with a total project investment of $371 million. The project was previously announced on Oct. 27.

For 10 years the company will be giving annual sums of $1.3 million to Rossford school district and $93000 to Penta Career Center.

Located near the First Solar Perrysburg facility groundbreaking for the new campus to be based on Oregon and Tracy roads is expected to take place later this month with completion by May 2024.

The six parcels of agricultural land which is 78 acres were purchased by First Solar on Oct. 25 for a total of $3.3 million.

The trustees approved the abatement unanimously.

“It’s great what they have done in Lake Township. It always seemed a little unfair that everything landed in our township and there was such a dividing line in terms of capital investment but to see what they have done there and to have this one land in our township is great for everybody” Trustee Bob Mack said.

Intended to replace the M113 armored personnel carriers as well as to counter the new Soviet BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles that entered service in 1966 the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle was one of the pillars of the BIG 5 super program launched in the early 70s by the US Army to modernize its capabilities and take into account the lessons of the Vietnam War but also of the two Arab-Israeli wars.

The new armored vehicle from FMC Corporation already at the origin of the M113 and the amphibious assault vehicle LVPT-7 broke deeply with the armored vehicles in service in Western armies with in particular a turret armed with a 25 mm M242 cannon. and a dual TOW anti-tank missile launcher allowing it to engage heavy armor including tanks at ranges of up to 4 km.

The long career of M2 Bradley in the US Army

With the appearance of the BMP-2 in 1984 the Bradley began a long series of modifications and improvements to increase survivability with reactive armor plates new communication and navigation systems and an additional engine. more powerful to compensate for the weight gain the tank having gone from 23 tons in its initial version to almost 35 tons in its latest versions.

The Bradley had its heyday during the Gulf War in 1991 the US Army having deployed 2200 of these armored vehicles against Iraq or approximately half of the fleet. While 20 Bradleys were destroyed during the ground campaign and 8 damaged mostly from friendly fire these destroyed a large number of Iraqi armor including T-72 tanks using its TOW missiles and T-55 tanks with its 25mm cannon armed with depleted uranium penetrator shells.

However during the second American intervention in Iraq the M2 showed certain weaknesses in particular as regards urban engagement and vis-a-vis the IED of the Iraqi insurgents. It became clear that its replacement envisaged since the beginning of the 2000s had to be accelerated.

This is how the Ground Combat Vehicle program was born officially launched in February 2010 but which quickly proved to be an impasse due to the requirements of the US Army which led to the design of an armored vehicle that was both very expensive and excessively heavy beyond 70 tonnes. The program was finally abandoned in 2014 not without costing American taxpayers nearly $20 billion.

The M2 Bradley has seen an increase in mass of almost 50% over the years hampering its mobility and impacting its consumption

The OMFV program

No sooner had the GCV program been canceled than it was replaced by a new program intended again to replace the M2 Bradley. This one designated by the acronym OMFV for Optionally Manned Fighting vehicle was officially launched in August 2014 using the remaining unspent budget of the GCV program within the Next Generation Combat Vehicle super program.

If the specifications of the US Army had evolved significantly vis-à-vis CGV in particular with regard to certain imperatives of dimensions and mass to allow the new armored vehicle to be transported by air C-17 that -this very quickly proved to be disconnected from the technological reality of the moment with certain contradictory requirements from each other in particular with regard to mass limitations in the face of protection requirements.

PARIS Nov. 04 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Constellium SE (NYSE: CSTM) announced today that it is joining the First Movers Coalition (FMC) a global initiative to accelerate zero-carbon technologies and reduce carbon emissions.



The First Movers Coalition is a global initiative led by the World Economic Forum and the U.S. Government to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors by leveraging companies’ combined purchasing power. More than 50 companies have joined the coalition to drive more green demand and low-carbon technologies and to help advance the world’s climate goals.

“We are proud to join the First Movers Coalition and to contribute to a faster decarbonization journey for the industry. Aluminium is fully and easily recyclable and nearly 75% of all aluminium ever produced is still in use today. The aluminium industry has a great role to play to promote the circular economy of tomorrow and we are excited to further leverage our sustainability actions with this global program” said Jean-Marc Germain CEO of Constellium. “We are committed to do our part in the fight against climate change and to collaborate across the value-chain to help drive the low-carbon transition.”

“Constellium’s impact across the value chain makes the company a tremendous addition to the First Movers Coalition. We look forward to partnering with Constellium to encourage clean energy innovation and move the aluminium industry toward a zero-carbon future” said Nancy Gillis Programme Head of the First Movers Coalition World Economic Forum.

By joining the FMC Constellium pledges that by 2030 10 percent of its primary aluminium purchases will be near-zero emissions emitting less than 3 tons of CO 2 per ton. The FMC pledge also includes a commitment that by 2030 at least 50 percent of all aluminium Constellium uses will be from recycled sources.

Constellium’s commitments to the FMC complement its targets to accomplish a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions intensity by 2030 (scope 1 2 and 3) and to increase its recycled input. They also further its engagement to build a sustainable supply chain. Constellium is a founding member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative and has certified several of its facilities. The company has recently joined the Mission Possible Partnership an alliance of climate leaders focused on boosting decarbonization across the entire value chain of the world’s highest-emitting industries in the next 10 years.

Palo Alto Fortinet Check Point Top Firewall Forrester Wave

Fortinet Check Point Enter Leaders Segment While Cisco Falls in Latest Rankings

A surging Fortinet and Check Point have joined perennial stalwart Palo Alto Networks atop the Forrester Wave Enterprise Firewalls 2022 report while Cisco slipped to the strong performers category.

""The COVID-19 pandemic turned security pros’ attention from securing the network to securing the remote workforce"" Forrester Senior Analysts David Holmes and Carlos Rivera wrote. ""Enterprise firewall vendors reported significant growth in the past year even though the employees who left the perimeter en masse two years ago have yet to return.""

Forrester's enterprise firewall leaderboard now belongs solely to pure-play cybersecurity vendors with all three leaders having at least 15 years of experience in developing and deploying firewalls. The focus Palo Alto Networks Fortinet and Check Point bring to cybersecurity stands in contrast to Cisco where security accounted for just 7.2% of the networking giant's $51.6 billion in sales for the fiscal year ended July 31.

Palo Alto Networks Check Point Software and Fortinet took the gold silver and bronze respectively for the strength of their current enterprise firewall offering. That's a dramatic change from August 2020 when Cisco Check Point and Palo Alto took the gold silver and bronze respectively.

The strategy category also saw ranking shifts with Fortinet catapulting from sixth in 2020 to second this year Sophos jumping from fifth to third despite the weakness of Sophos' current offering which kept the company in the strong performers category. Palo Alto Networks retained the top spot for enterprise firewall strategy while Check Point slipped from second in 2020 to fourth this year.

Forrester's rankings are generally reflected in their market share with Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet and Check Point controlling 19% 16% 14% and 9% respectively of the security appliance market as of spring 2021 according to Statista.

""Firewall vendors retooled their portfolios to apply artificial intelligence vendor-delivered services and partner service for network security"" Forrester wrote. ""The vendors built platforms friendly to MSPs and MSSPs that with the help of the vendors' services can use human brains to close the loop after attackers get past the firewalls.""

Forrester urged firewall vendors to demonstrate efficacy beyond signature matching deliver required capabilities within customer budgets and address the skills gap through managed services. Several enterprise firewall vendors are fielding data science teams to deploy deep learning or expert-generated analytics to proactively detect malicious content rather than taking a reactive posture Forrester says (see: Fortinet VMware Cisco Drive SD-WAN Gartner Magic Quadrant).

""The need to have the right security solution is crucial to security architecture and to overall network health and performance"" Forrester wrote. ""Organizations looking to deploy new appliances in their enterprise or data centers need solutions that can support varying architectural needs conditions and requirements.""

Outside of the leaders here's how Forrester sees the enterprise firewall market:

Strong Performers: Sophos Cisco Juniper Networks SonicWall;

Sophos Cisco Juniper Networks SonicWall; Contenders: Barracuda Networks WatchGuard Forcepoint.

Forrester classified Huawei as a strong enterprise firewall performer in the August 2020 wave but the controversial Chinese company wasn't even considered as part of the wave this time around.

Palo Alto Leverages AI ML to Stop Attacks in Real Time

Palo Alto Networks has extended advanced URL filtering across its threat prevention portfolio and security services to stop phishing and web-based threats and protect against zero-day attacks says Anand Oswal senior vice president of network security products. The company wants to harness artificial intelligence and machine learning to stop attacks in line and in real time according to Oswal.

Oswal says the company introduced its first machine learning-powered firewalls two years ago which pushed ML coding into the network security stack to stop variations of existing malware and then eight months ago started infusing deep learning into its network security technology. Meanwhile AI can validate the health of network security tools by ensuring there's sufficient bandwidth and memory (see: Nikesh Arora on the Palo Alto Networks Growth Strategy).

""Customers are looking to consolidate their infrastructure on best-of-breed platforms"" Oswal tells Information Security Media Group. ""So we have to be best of breed.""

Forrester said Palo Alto Networks customers complain about the company's subscription costs and licensing practices and say it is the only firewall vendor that still charges for basic SD-WAN capabilities. Oswal says customers have the choice of procuring the company's technology through enterprise agreements as part of a service bundle or on an a la carte basis with Palo Alto taking pride in the service it provides.

""The traditional way of doing services with signatures and databases has lower costs but they're not as effective"" Oswal says. ""When you have something that is more advanced that has some additional costs.""

Fortinet Extends Firewall Protection to SASE Container Environments

Fortinet has expanded its zero trust network access application gateway so that users can verify their device posture without having to purchase an additional tool says Vice President of Products Nirav Shah. The company has doubled down on its AL and ML-powered services to accelerate analysis and ensure customers are getting the full device and security posture benefits from FortiGate firewalls.

Shah says Fortinet has worked to make its FortiOS operating system available in a container or as part of a SASE architecture to ensure users and apps have the same level of protection no matter where they reside. The company has long offered its firewall as either a hardware appliance or a virtual machine in the public cloud and he says the investment in SASE will help secure remote- and container-based users (see: Ken Xie on Why Fortinet Is Leaning Into SD-WAN OT Security).

""It's always been about solving customers' problems and making operations simple for them while providing best-in-class security"" Shah tells Information Security Media Group. ""Bringing networking and security together means Fortinet customers get a return on investment way faster than people working with any other vendor.""

Forrester says Fortinet customers found the company's usability and policy creation to be merely average. Shah says the company tends to get very positive feedback around usability since it hasn't stitched acquisitions together and strives to have both usability and workflow by intuitive regardless of form factor. The company will address use cases where customers want to see improvement Shah says.

""We have cutting-edge technology and we will continue to expand our security services to make sure we are stopping threats by both preventing and detecting within seconds"" Shah says.

Check Point Brings Deep Learning to DNS and Phishing Prevention

Check Point Software has leveraged deep learning to more effectively prevent advanced DNS phishing and IoT-based attacks says Vice President of Product Management Eyal Manor. Deep learning has allowed Check Point to analyze in real time the domains users are visiting while minimizing false positives and incorporating a large number of parameters without any training needed Manor says.

A huge range of phishing attacks are targeted at specific people and triggered at a particular time with Check Point's Quantum security gateways inserting JavaScript that runs on the webpage in real time he says. And even though clients have gotten better at finding IoT devices he says autonomous zero trust access profiles should be built for each device to determine which protocols are allowed or blocked (see: Check Point CEO Gil Shwed on Why Prevention Beats Detection).

""We spent the past two years since the previous Forrester report assessing the gaps to understand what we can do better to improve ourselves"" Manor tells Information Security Media Group. ""We want to catch gaps on one hand and become more innovative on the other hand.""

Forrester criticized Check Point for being the last of the firewall vendors to offer integrated SD-WAN to customers and found the company might have turned a corner on customer support issues. Check Point will soon announce SD-WAN capabilities that are embedded and integrated into the firm's Quantum Spark gateways which will autonomously clean up security policies and route traffic to the best places.

""We're behind in SD-WAN"" Manor says. ""But we're not here to close the gaps. We're here to do it better.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pdHdlYi5jby56YS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZvcnRpbmV0cy1sYXRlc3QtbmV4dC1nZW4tZmlyZXdhbGwtaGVscHMtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWFjaGlldmUtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktZ29hbHMtYnktY29uc3VtaW5nLTgwLWxlc3MtcG93ZXItdGhhbi1yaXZhbHMva1liZTlNWGJiUDN2QVdwR9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fortinet's latest next-gen firewall helps customers achieve sustainability goals by consuming 80% less power than rivals,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pdHdlYi5jby56YS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZvcnRpbmV0cy1sYXRlc3QtbmV4dC1nZW4tZmlyZXdhbGwtaGVscHMtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWFjaGlldmUtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktZ29hbHMtYnktY29uc3VtaW5nLTgwLWxlc3MtcG93ZXItdGhhbi1yaXZhbHMva1liZTlNWGJiUDN2QVdwR9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF23A47C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pdHdlYi5jby56YS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZvcnRpbmV0cy1sYXRlc3QtbmV4dC1nZW4tZmlyZXdhbGwtaGVscHMtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWFjaGlldmUtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktZ29hbHMtYnktY29uc3VtaW5nLTgwLWxlc3MtcG93ZXItdGhhbi1yaXZhbHMva1liZTlNWGJiUDN2QVdwR9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Should Fox exercise its option to take the stake it would be at a price of at least $3.72 billion.

The decision ends the more-than-yearlong lawsuit between the two companies over the valuation of FanDuel which has emerged as one of the leading U.S. sports betting platforms alongside services from DraftKings  Caesars and MGM .

The price that Fox would have to pay is based on a FanDuel valuation of $20 billion according to the ruling. Flutter which owns nearly 95% of FanDuel acquired a 37.2% stake in the company in December 2021 at an implied valuation of $11.2 billion. Fox had argued the price should be based on that threshold.

Still Fox could have been ordered to pay much more. A March 2021 estimate by Jeffries analysts said FanDuel could worth up to $35 billion which would value a nearly one-fifth stake at closer to $6 billion.

""Fox is pleased with the fair and favorable outcome of the Flutter arbitration"" the company said in a statement following the ruling. ""Fox has no obligation to commit capital towards this opportunity unless and until it exercises the option. This optionality over a meaningful equity stake in the market leading U.S. online sports betting operation confirms the tremendous value Fox has created as a first mover media partner in the U.S. sports betting landscape.""

Fox has a 10-year option to acquire the stake which runs through December 2030. The arbitrator ruled that there would be a 5% annual escalator on its purchase price meaning the current price of a deal would be $4.1 billion.

""Today's ruling vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certainty on what it would cost Fox to buy into this business should they wish to do so"" said Flutter CEO Peter Jackson in a statement.

Fox said as part of the arbitration ruling Flutter cannot pursue an IPO for FanDuel without Fox's consent or approval from the arbitrator. However Flutter disputed that claim and later told CNBC in a statement that Fox does not have a block on any potential IPO of FanDuel should one occur.

Flutter had previously considered taking FanDuel public taking advantage of the booming sports betting market.

Sports betting has continued to grow in the U.S. as more states bring legal sports betting online — as of Nov. 1 33 states allow some form of sports betting with California having two measures on its ballot to legalize it.

That has pushed up revenues as well. Commercial sports betting revenue nationally through August was $3.97 billion up nearly 70% year over year according to data from the American Gaming Association.

As we enter the final week of the midterm election voters are expressing deep concern about the state of the economy and inflation. They should.

Today we live in an economy in which the billionaires are getting much richer while working families fall further behind. Unbelievably while 60 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck we now have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had in the history of our country – with three multi-billionaires owning more wealth than the bottom half of Americans. While employers squeeze workers and their unions for cuts to health care and other benefits the CEOs of major corporations now make nearly 400 times more than their average employees – the largest employer-worker gap in our history.

During this campaign my Republican colleagues talk a lot about inflation and they are right to do so. Over the last year Americans have become sick and tired of paying outrageously high prices for food gas health care prescription drugs housing and other necessities.

CNN’S KING PRAISES BIDEN SPEECH SAYS DEMOCRATIC CRITICS ARE HAVING 'SILLY WASHINGTON CONVERSATIONS'

Unfortunately most Republicans completely ignore the underlying causes of inflation and the few ""solutions"" they do offer would make a bad situation even worse.

Yes. During this political season it is easy to blame President Joe Biden and Democrats for inflation. But that’s just not accurate.

Let’s be clear. Inflation is not unique to America. It is an international crisis. In the European Union inflation is nearly 11%. In Germany it is 11.6%. In the United Kingdom it is 10.1%. In Ireland it’s 9.6%. In America it’s 8.2% much too high but lower than it is throughout much of Europe.

The truth is that inflation is to a significant extent caused by the ongoing global pandemic the break in international supply chains and the horrific war in Ukraine. But there is another major reason for inflation that too few people talk about. And that is the unprecedented level of corporate greed that we are now seeing.

According to a recent study nearly 54% of the rise in inflation is directly attributable to the astronomical increase in corporate profit margins. In America today while the working class struggles to put food on the table fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes corporate profits are at a 70-year-high.

If you want to know why you are paying $4 $5 $6 for a gallon of gas you should know that the profits of ExxonMobil Chevron BP and Shell skyrocketed by 169% so far this year to $125 billion. These four huge oil companies are spending over $73 billion not to reduce gas prices at the pump but to buy back their own stock and increase dividends to their wealthy stockholders.

If you are wondering why you are paying 43% more for an airline ticket this year you should know that profits are up 186% at American Airlines and 99% at United Airlines in the third quarter to nearly $1.5 billion. Yes. These are the same companies that received taxpayer assistance of more than $20 billion during the pandemic while cutting 6400 jobs.

If you are wondering why global food prices skyrocketed by over 33% last year and are expected to go up another 23% this year you should know that billionaires in the global food and agri-business industry became $382 billion richer during the pandemic.

If you are wondering why we continue to pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs you should know that Pfizer has increased its profits by 42% so far this year to $26.4 billion.

I apologize to no one that we expanded the Child Tax Credit that provided $300 a month per child to working families so that parents could raise their kids with a modicum of security.

Even though inflation is an international problem my Republican colleagues want to blame rising prices on Democratic spending – especially the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in March 2021. Well before you accept that argument I urge you to remember where we were at that terrible and painful moment in American history.

As the worst pandemic in modern history raged across the country over 3000 Americans were dying from COVID-19 every single day and millions including many with inadequate health insurance were getting sick. Doctors and nurses lacked adequate personal protective equipment and many hospitals flooded with COVID-19 patients were on the verge of collapse.

Further as a result of the pandemic in early 2021 the United States was suffering its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Twenty-four million Americans were unemployed under-employed or had given up looking for work. Hunger in America was at its highest level in decades. Millions of Americans were in danger of being evicted from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses all over the country were on the verge of going bankrupt.

As the chairman of the Budget Committee I apologize to no one for helping to pass this bill in the Senate – without one Republican vote. At a time of an unprecedented health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic the American Rescue Plan did exactly what a democratic government in a civilized society is supposed to do: respond to the needs of people living in fear and desperation.

I apologize to no one that we provided every working class American and their children with a $1400 direct payment to get them through the economic crisis they were experiencing.

I apologize to no one that we extended unemployment benefits and provided an extra $300 a week to Americans who had lost their jobs.

I apologize to no one that we expanded the Child Tax Credit that provided $300 a month per child to working families so that parents could raise their kids with a modicum of security.

I apologize to no one that we prevented hospitals from closing their doors during the pandemic fed the hungry prevented evictions and foreclosures and made sure every American could receive a COVID-19 vaccine for free.

While Republicans continue to criticize the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that helped struggling working class families in a time of economic desperation it is fair to ask what they are proposing to do if they gain control over the House and the Senate? And here’s the answer.

Almost all of them from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on down want to provide billionaires a tax break worth up to $1.75 trillion by completely repealing the estate tax.

The estate tax only applies to the wealthiest of the wealthy the top one-tenth of one percent of American families who inherit over $25 million. In other words 99.9% of Americans would not benefit at all from the repeal of the estate tax.

If the estate tax was repealed Elon Musk’s family would receive a tax break of up to $80 billion alone. Now I don’t know who Musk’s kids are and I have nothing against them. I wish them well. But they don’t deserve a tax break of up to $80 billion.

How would Republicans pay for this $1.75 trillion tax break to billionaires? They would pay for it by making massive cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. This year the 158-member Republican Study Committee in the House proposed cutting Medicare by $2.8 trillion and Social Security by $729 billion. An increasing number of Republicans have even threatened to default on our nation’s debt unless they are able to enact cuts to Social Security and Medicare. How absurd is that?

No. You don’t reduce inflation by giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting benefits for the elderly the sick the children and the poor.

You combat inflation by taking on corporate greed and passing a windfall profits tax. You combat inflation by taking on the power of the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the giant food companies and lowering the outrageously high costs of healthcare prescription drugs gas and groceries.

As the longest serving Independent in congressional history I’m not going to tell you that Democrats are perfect. Far from it. In a Senate evenly divided 50-50 there are at least two Democrats who have made it clear that they are more interested in protecting corporate interests than the needs of working-class families. That has got to change.

Right now more than any time in modern history we need a Congress that has the courage to take on the wealthy campaign contributors super-PACs and lobbyists who work overtime in protecting the interests of billionaires and corporate interests. And that is precisely what Democrats must do if they expand their majority in the House and the Senate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zcG9ydHMtYmV0dGluZy8yMDIyL2ZveC1mYW5kdWVsLWZsdXR0ZXItc3Rha2UtcnVsaW5nLTEyMzQ2OTM0NDIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Nwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLzIwMjIvZm94LWZhbmR1ZWwtZmx1dHRlci1zdGFrZS1ydWxpbmctMTIzNDY5MzQ0Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox Flutter Both Claim Victory After FanDuel Arbitration Battle,"An arbitrator has reached a ruling in the long-running legal battle between Fox Corp. and Flutter a decision that could have significant ramifications for the future of U.S. sportsbooks FanDuel and Fox Bet.

The disagreement centered around complexities that arose after Flutter (LSE: FLTR) purchased The Stars Group in early 2020. The move expanded Flutter’s portfolio to include Fox Bet a competitor to Flutter-owned FanDuel raising questions about how the gaming giant would allocate U.S. resources to both brands. Fox also held a ten-year option to purchase a large chunk of The Stars Group’s U.S. business a right that the media company (Nasdaq: FOX) believed translated to an option to buy 18.6% of FanDuel at a later date.

A New York arbitrator issued a decision Friday according to a Fox statement. The ruling affirms Fox’s ten-year right to buy into FanDuel starting at a $20 billion valuation the statement said a number higher than Fox’s original proposal and lower than Flutter’s. The arbitrator also ruled that FanDuel cannot IPO without an agreement with Fox and that Flutter does not have to dedicate equal resources to the two brands which it currently isn’t doing.

“Fox is pleased with the fair and favorable outcome of the Flutter arbitration” the statement said. “This optionality over a meaningful equity stake in the market leading U.S. online sports betting operation confirms the tremendous value Fox has created as a first mover media partner in the U.S. sports betting landscape.”

FanDuel declined to comment. Flutter said in a statement that it was also happy with the arbitrator’s ruling. It cited Fox’s strike price higher than the media company initially wanted. It also pushed back on Fox’s interpretation of the IPO portion of the ruling saying I will not attempt a FanDuel IPO until either an agreement is made with Fox or a more definitive ruling comes from the arbitrator. It says it expects that in “early 2023.”



“Today’s ruling vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certainty on what it would cost Fox to buy into this business should they wish to do so” Flutter CEO Peter Jackson said in the statement.

The decision should pave the way for both companies to assess the future of both FanDuel and Fox Bet. FanDuel has emerged at the early leader in online sports betting in the U.S. and Flutter has been mulling a FanDuel IPO for years. That could certainly still happen following this ruling though it would need to include input from Fox.

Fox Bet on the other hand has struggled to gain traction—FanDuel had 36% of the U.S. market in 2021 according to numbers from Eilers & Krejcik followed by DraftKings (24%) and BetMGM (15%). Fox Bet by contrast is at most in the low single digits. Fox Bet could eventually be folded a decision that might suit both Fox and Flutter.

When Fox Bet launched in 2019 within The Stars Group Fox was given a ten-year option to buy 50% of The Stars Group’s U.S. business. When Flutter bought The Stars Group Fox believed the option would translate to a ten-year option to buy 18.6% of FanDuel. Not only were the two sides in disagreement about the option they also disagreed on the price. Fox believed it should be able to buy in at an $11.2 billion valuation which was the valuation on the company when Flutter bought a large chunk in late 2020. Flutter believed Fox should have to pay fair market value as of July 2021 as determined by outside banks. It’s unclear how big Flutter wanted the valuation to be; the arbitrator’s ruling said Fox’s option is currently worth $3.72 billion which translates to a valuation of about $20 billion. That option increases by 5% each year regardless of how FanDuel’s actual valuation changes.

That’s particularly noteworthy given that FanDuel’s success in the U.S. has come alongside a global market shift for many sports betting companies. Flutter was trading at an all-time high of $234 (£168.9) in March 2021 around the time the petition was originally filed. It closed Friday at roughly $131 (£115.1) meaning the market value for the company has shifted dramatically over the course of the legal fight.

Another way to view that metric: DraftKings one of FanDuel’s primary competitors had a market cap of $28 billion in March 2021 and is currently worth $5.07 billion.



Flutter’s statement also provided some clarity on the future of Fox Bet. It said that Fox could still exercise its options with The Stars Group’s U.S. business and if it does not do so by August 2023 both parties have the right to terminate the Fox Bet business. Should that happen the Fox Bet branding would return to Fox.

Fox petitioned New York’s Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) last year a process that allowed both parties to debate the matter in a confidential forum and avoid litigation where filings would be made in public and allegations or revelations could potentially impact the reputations of these publicly traded companies. The arbitration began earlier this year after settlement talks failed to produce an agreement.

While the ruling is binding either side could technically challenge the ruling by asking a judge to vacate the ruling. That’s a high bar however under federal law judges are required to review arbitration decisions with high deference. The appealing company would have to show the decision was far outside the boundary of basic legal principles which would be hard to establish.

Should Fox exercise its option to take the stake it would be at a price of at least $3.72 billion.

The decision ends the more-than-yearlong lawsuit between the two companies over the valuation of FanDuel which has emerged as one of the leading U.S. sports betting platforms alongside services from DraftKings  Caesars and MGM .

The price that Fox would have to pay is based on a FanDuel valuation of $20 billion according to the ruling. Flutter which owns nearly 95% of FanDuel acquired a 37.2% stake in the company in December 2021 at an implied valuation of $11.2 billion. Fox had argued the price should be based on that threshold.

Still Fox could have been ordered to pay much more. A March 2021 estimate by Jeffries analysts said FanDuel could worth up to $35 billion which would value a nearly one-fifth stake at closer to $6 billion.

""Fox is pleased with the fair and favorable outcome of the Flutter arbitration"" the company said in a statement following the ruling. ""Fox has no obligation to commit capital towards this opportunity unless and until it exercises the option. This optionality over a meaningful equity stake in the market leading U.S. online sports betting operation confirms the tremendous value Fox has created as a first mover media partner in the U.S. sports betting landscape.""

Fox has a 10-year option to acquire the stake which runs through December 2030. The arbitrator ruled that there would be a 5% annual escalator on its purchase price meaning the current price of a deal would be $4.1 billion.

""Today's ruling vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certainty on what it would cost Fox to buy into this business should they wish to do so"" said Flutter CEO Peter Jackson in a statement.

Fox said as part of the arbitration ruling Flutter cannot pursue an IPO for FanDuel without Fox's consent or approval from the arbitrator. However Flutter disputed that claim and later told CNBC in a statement that Fox does not have a block on any potential IPO of FanDuel should one occur.

Flutter had previously considered taking FanDuel public taking advantage of the booming sports betting market.

Sports betting has continued to grow in the U.S. as more states bring legal sports betting online — as of Nov. 1 33 states allow some form of sports betting with California having two measures on its ballot to legalize it.

That has pushed up revenues as well. Commercial sports betting revenue nationally through August was $3.97 billion up nearly 70% year over year according to data from the American Gaming Association.

But that continued growth hasn't benefitted all public sports betting companies. DraftKings stock posted its worst-ever decline on Friday after the company reported monthly customer growth that fell short of estimates even as it revised its revenue forecast upwards.

If the estate tax was repealed Elon Musk’s family would receive a tax break of up to $80 billion alone. Now I don’t know who Musk’s kids are and I have nothing against them. I wish them well. But they don’t deserve a tax break of up to $80 billion.

‘Let’s be clear. Inflation is not unique to America. It is an international crisis. In the European Union inflation is nearly 11%. In Germany it is 11.6%. In the United Kingdom it is 10.1%. In Ireland it’s 9.6%. In America it’s 8.2% much too high but lower than it is throughout much of Europe.’

How would Republicans pay for this $1.75 trillion tax break to billionaires? They would pay for it by making massive cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. This year the 158-member Republican Study Committee in the House proposed cutting Medicare by $2.8 trillion and Social Security by $729 billion. An increasing number of Republicans have even threatened to default on our nation’s debt unless they are able to enact cuts to Social Security and Medicare. How absurd is that?

No. You don’t reduce inflation by giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting benefits for the elderly the sick the children and the poor.

You combat inflation by taking on corporate greed and passing a windfall profits tax. You combat inflation by taking on the power of the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the giant food companies and lowering the outrageously high costs of healthcare prescription drugs gas and groceries.

As the longest serving Independent in congressional history I’m not going to tell you that Democrats are perfect. Far from it. In a Senate evenly divided 50-50 there are at least two Democrats who have made it clear that they are more interested in protecting corporate interests than the needs of working-class families. That has got to change.

Right now more than any time in modern history we need a Congress that has the courage to take on the wealthy campaign contributors super-PACs and lobbyists who work overtime in protecting the interests of billionaires and corporate interests. And that is precisely what Democrats must do if they expand their majority in the House and the Senate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zcG9ydHMtYmV0dGluZy8yMDIyL2ZveC1mYW5kdWVsLWZsdXR0ZXItc3Rha2UtcnVsaW5nLTEyMzQ2OTM0NDIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Nwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLzIwMjIvZm94LWZhbmR1ZWwtZmx1dHRlci1zdGFrZS1ydWxpbmctMTIzNDY5MzQ0Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox Flutter Both Claim Victory After FanDuel Arbitration Battle,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zcG9ydHMtYmV0dGluZy8yMDIyL2ZveC1mYW5kdWVsLWZsdXR0ZXItc3Rha2UtcnVsaW5nLTEyMzQ2OTM0NDIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Nwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLzIwMjIvZm94LWZhbmR1ZWwtZmx1dHRlci1zdGFrZS1ydWxpbmctMTIzNDY5MzQ0Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF25FA050>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zcG9ydHMtYmV0dGluZy8yMDIyL2ZveC1mYW5kdWVsLWZsdXR0ZXItc3Rha2UtcnVsaW5nLTEyMzQ2OTM0NDIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Nwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLzIwMjIvZm94LWZhbmR1ZWwtZmx1dHRlci1zdGFrZS1ydWxpbmctMTIzNDY5MzQ0Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzljMWQ1N2ZkLWIxYjYtNGZiYS05NDg2LTIwZTU4MzU5ZmZiNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York legal ruling ends Fox's battle with Flutter over FanDuel price,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ft.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /content/9c1d57fd-b1b6-4fba-9486-20e58359ffb5 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF25FB400>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzljMWQ1N2ZkLWIxYjYtNGZiYS05NDg2LTIwZTU4MzU5ZmZiNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The analyst firm’s study of 3500 workers found that 58% are stressed and 48% are worried about work. 41% are also working nine extra unpaid hours of overtime a week.

Piers Hudson research leader at Gartner’s HR practice tells UNLEASH: “Many business leaders are convinced that employee stress has reduced from the traumatic days of the pandemic – they are entirely mistaken.

“The fact is employees have never truly recovered from the pandemic and continue to suffer from ongoing fatigue. At the same time there has been an economic crisis political uncertainty and meanwhile employees have had to adapt to the challenges of working in a hybrid environment.”

Not only is this an issue for productivity – stressed burnt out and distracted workers are unlikely to be able to perform at this best – it is feeding into sky-high quit rates dubbed the ‘Great Resignation’. As a result of burnout 68% of employees told Gartner they are less likely to stay at their organizations.

How to tackle employee burnout

While employers are more concerned about burnout than ever before they are still stuck in a traditional mindset. 72% of 250 HR leaders surveyed by Gartner said that they believed higher performing employees work longer hours.

In fact the opposite is true. Brent Cassell vice-president of advisory in Gartner’s HR practice shared: “Simply put: More hours worked does not equal more results. Instead organizations must rethink how they approach rest – rest should be embedded into the workflow to prevent burnout rather than being used to recover from it.”

Gartner recommends that employers embrace ‘proactive rest’ – this is where employees are given the tools and the space to rest and recharge with the ultimate aim of avoiding burnout in the future.

Hudson shares with UNLEASH: “Progressive organizations are looking at limiting virtual work time whether that be by timeboxing where employees are expected to be available for synchronous work only during a limited period in the day or implementing meeting-free days – some even going as far as meeting-free weeks.”

Gartner’s data shows that proactive rest leads to a 26% increase in performance as well as a significant reduction in burnout – 22% of employees without proactive rest are burnt out compared to 2% for those implementing these changes.

Hudson concludes: “It’s important that organizations begin to normalize activities for rest and recovery with leaders becoming role models of this behavior. They also need to take steps to incentivize it.

“Progressive organizations are communicating the importance of rest and taking active steps to disassociate time spent working in relation to performance which involves measuring performance based on outcomes achieved rather than hours logged”.

Employees want to learn and grow

Gartner’s research further found that the pandemic did not just impact employee stress and wellbeing but it fundamentally changed workers’ priorities. Of the 3500 workers surveyed 65% said COVID-19 had made them re-consider the role of work in their lives.

One change has been a focus on development both personally and professionally. Workers expect organizations to provide them with these development opportunities otherwise they will seek it elsewhere.

75% of workers looking for development opportunities will do so outside of their current organization and just 25% are confident about their career at their current organization.

Vitorio Bretas director in Gartner’s HR practice commented: “Employees are leaving their current employers for better professional development opportunities (45%) at similar rates as they leave for higher compensation (48%).

“35% of employees surveyed said they left their employer for better career trajectories.”

Therefore if employees want to thrive in the ‘Great Resignation’ and beyond they don’t just need to prioritize rest but also think about their learning and development offerings.

According to Gartner 94% of workers want to develop skills outside their roles and one in three don’t know how to progress in the next three years. So employers need to empower managers to have conversations with their direct reports on their learning and development priorities.

The time for business to act is now “if they are to prevent employee departures and talent gaps opening up in what is a difficult economic climate. They need to make the workplace a secure and fulfilling place for staff” concluded Benjamin Loring senior principal in Gartner’s HR practice.

However poor data quality is a barrier faced by organizations in their quest to become more data-driven. So it is imperative to have a clear data quality strategy that relies on proactive data quality management as data moves from producers to consumers.

Unlock quality data with IBM

We are excited to share that Gartner recently named IBM a Leader in the 2022 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Data Quality Solutions.

Access the full report here.

We believe this is a testament to IBM’s vision to empower data professionals with trusted information through data quality capabilities including data cleansing data lineage data observability and master data management.

IBM recently expanded its data quality capabilities with the acquisition of Databand.ai and its leading data observability offerings. This complements IBM’s partnership with MANTA to integrate automated data lineage capabilities from MANTA with IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog on Cloud Pak for Data.

Why does data quality matter across the data lifecycle?

Data quality issues can have far-reaching consequences across the lifecycle of data:

1. Analytics and AI

When a sophisticated AI/ML model confronts bad-quality data it is the latter that usually wins. As organizations increasingly rely on AI/ML for critical business decisions the role of a trusted data foundation that delivers high-quality data is paramount. So it is important to provide data consumers with a curated set of high-quality data and allow them to search for relevant data through a well-defined data catalog.

2. Data Engineering

Data engineers spend a disproportionate amount of their time firefighting bad data. This could be because a lot of the current data quality approaches are reactive triggered only when data consumers complain about data quality. Once poor-quality data moves from data sources into downstream processes it gets challenging to remediate quality issues. A smarter approach would be to plug data quality issues upstream through active monitoring and automated data cleansing at the source. Data observability capability makes data quality checks upstream possible.

3. Data Governance

Ensuring data quality is critical for data governance initiatives. Increasingly enterprise data is spread across multiple environments which contributes to inconsistent data silos that complicate data governance initiatives and create data integrity issues that could impact Business Intelligence and analytics applications. It is critical to promote a common business language across the enterprise to break down these silos. One effective way to identify bad-quality data before it flows into downstream processes is with the use of active metadata to foster greater understanding and trust in data and ensure that only high-quality data makes its way to data consumers. Equally important is the ability to understand data lineage by tracking the flow of data back to its source which can prove handy when remediating data quality issues.

IBM’s holistic approach to Data Quality

With a strong end-to-end data management experience combined with innovation in metadata and AI-driven automation IBM differentiates itself by offering integrated quality and governance capabilities.

IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog QualityStage and Match360 services on Cloud Pak for Data offer a composable data quality solution with an easy way to start small and expand your data quality program across the full enterprise data ecosystem. Watson Knowledge Catalog serves as an automated metadata-driven foundation that assigns data quality scores to assets and improves curation through automated data quality rules. The solution offers out-of-the-box automation rules to simplify the addressing of data quality issues.

With the recent acquisition of Databand.ai a leading provider of data observability solutions IBM can elevate traditional DataOps by using historical trends to compute statistics about data workloads and data pipelines directly at the source determining if they are working and pinpointing where any problems may exist. IBM’s partnership with Manta for automated data lineage capabilities further strengthens its ability to help clients find track and prevent issues closer to the source and for a more streamlined operational approach to managing data.

IBM offers a wide range of capabilities necessary for end-to-end data quality management including data profiling (both at rest and in-flight) data cleansing data monitoring data matching (discovering duplicated records or linking master records) and data enrichment to ensure data consumers have access to high-quality data.

Reliability and security of data and speed of data transmission are critical in healthcare. Wires ensure that. But now 5G comes with a level of reliability speed and security far superior to 4G and will allow many of those wires to be dispensed with. That opens up a range of possibilities.It’s the reason why the $18-billion GE Healthcare recently established its first global 5G innovation lab at its R&D centre in Bengaluru.Jan Makela  CEO of the imaging business says it is a big investment and accelerates all their product teams into 5G. “The idea is to try out ideas and think about the products to be launched using 5G” he says.The company’s engineers in India have already done great work with AI/ ML. Now they will lead the company’s 5G innovations.Today the machine that scans your body for instance is also the one that crunches the data and gives you a picture on the machine. 5G Makela says will allow you to send the data to the cloud where the picture would be instantly created and sent back. “So you could make the scanning machine much simpler and cheaper” he says. Which means MRI and CT machines could be available in more hospitals and remote locations.Data on the cloud in combination with 5G Makela says will also enable doctors to easily access patient data from anywhere making patient care easier and cheaper.Girish Raghavan  VP of engineering at GE Healthcare says 5G will allow all information about say a stroke patient being brought in an ambulance to be available to doctors by the time the patient reaches the hospital allowing them to take the critical decision on the care path well in advance. He says video consultations and remote patient monitoring will become enormously more effective. “In India patients travel with family and come to big cities which is a costly affair. With 5G they can remain in their hometown and yet get the same care they would get in big cities” he says. In a few years he says 5G may even enable complex robotic surgeries by highly skilled doctors sitting remotely.The India tech centre Raghavan says is the epicentre of GE Healthcare’s digital transformation innovation. “We are really good in five areas. One we have the best AI technologies being developed here. Two we have the best data science team here. Three we are the epicentre of cloud development. Four we do a lot of work on additive technologies. In fact the first additive part ever to get into a healthcare product was done here. And now we have 5G. We have very core technologies that we expect will transform healthcare in the next decade” he says.Makela says since GE has many different kinds of machines that pick up data about the same patient the company is now using technology to bring together all of this data and use AI/ ML to provide insights that make doctor decisions better and faster.This is becoming particularly important as the industry moves towards precision healthcare. Previously Makela says cancers involved standard treatments – surgery chemo and/or radiotherapy. Today a variety of different drugs and protocols have emerged to treat different kinds of cancer cell mutations. So GE is working to bring together the lab test results the DNA analysis of the cancer the genomic data the imaging data the medical notes and that would enable a doctor to build a better picture of the patient and predict the best treatment.A cardiology patient Makela says often goes through a variety of hardware – ECG ultrasound CT interventional ultrasound patient monitoring devices. “For years we have sold all those bits of hardware. But a cardiologist will say help me understand if this is a person who is a candidate for valve replacement help me fuse the images from the CT machine and the ultrasound machine so I can plan better how I do the surgery. Once you start to join these things together the doctor can do more personalised procedures at lower cost and better patient outcomes” he says.Inside this whole system is a lot of software and AI. And a lot of that work Makela says is driven by the technology centre in India “because our biggest software centre is here. ”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaGl0aW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUuY29tL25ld3MvbnV2YW5jZS1oZWFsdGgtcGlsb3RzLWF0LWhvbWUtcmVtb3RlLXBhdGllbnQtbW9uaXRvcmluZy1wcm9ncmFt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nuvance Health Pilots At-Home Remote Patient Monitoring Program,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaGl0aW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUuY29tL25ld3MvbnV2YW5jZS1oZWFsdGgtcGlsb3RzLWF0LWhvbWUtcmVtb3RlLXBhdGllbnQtbW9uaXRvcmluZy1wcm9ncmFt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1847D90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaGl0aW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUuY29tL25ld3MvbnV2YW5jZS1oZWFsdGgtcGlsb3RzLWF0LWhvbWUtcmVtb3RlLXBhdGllbnQtbW9uaXRvcmluZy1wcm9ncmFt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0bm9ubGluZS5jb20vY29udGVudC9jb25zaWRlci1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtbXJpLWd1aWRlZC1icmVhc3QtYmlvcHN5LWdyaWQtcGxhdGVzLWR1ZS1zaG9ydGFnZS1sZXR0ZXItaGVhbHRoLWNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Consider Alternatives for MRI-Guided Breast Biopsy Grid Plates Due to Shortage - A Letter to Health Care Providers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0bm9ubGluZS5jb20vY29udGVudC9jb25zaWRlci1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtbXJpLWd1aWRlZC1icmVhc3QtYmlvcHN5LWdyaWQtcGxhdGVzLWR1ZS1zaG9ydGFnZS1sZXR0ZXItaGVhbHRoLWNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF18453F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0bm9ubGluZS5jb20vY29udGVudC9jb25zaWRlci1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtbXJpLWd1aWRlZC1icmVhc3QtYmlvcHN5LWdyaWQtcGxhdGVzLWR1ZS1zaG9ydGFnZS1sZXR0ZXItaGVhbHRoLWNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsYWNrZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY29saW4tcGFycmlzLW5hbWVkLTIwMjMtYmxhY2stZW5naW5lZXItb2YtdGhlLXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colin Parris Named 2023 Black Engineer of the Year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.blackengineer.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/colin-parris-named-2023-black-engineer-of-the-year/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FCF1847B80>, 'Connection to www.blackengineer.com timed out.
