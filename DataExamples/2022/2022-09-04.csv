""Whether that is sort of your modern-day farmer or your traditional even Mennonite farmer they have cellphones and smartphones in their pocket"" Lennon the general manager of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) said in a phone interview from her office in Guelph Ont.

She said there's an increasing amount of technology and data on farms and in the agricultural sector. But as farm equipment becomes more advanced and connected to the internet there also are concerns they'll become targets for cyberattacks something that could also put Canada's food security at risk.

Ali Dehghantanha is a computer scientist at the University of Guelph and the Canada Research Chair in cybersecurity and threat intelligence.

His Cyber Science Lab focuses on cybersecurity digital forensics threat hunting and threat intelligence. In the past year it has been called to investigate 11 cases of cyberattacks involving the farm industry. Dehghantanha said that a significant number.

He said the most common attacks involve ransomware where the attacker gains access to a computer system and data then asks for payment to release it back to the individual.

Ali Dehghantanha is a computer scientist at the University of Guelph and Canada Research Chair in cybersecurity and threat intelligence. He says anyone can be an easy target for hackers if devices aren't kept up to date. (University of Guelph)

""We have seen quite a few cases of the data leaks … and we normally find these data leakage as they are becoming available in the dark web for selling"" Dehghantanha said.

In some cases it's individuals doing the hacking. In other cases it can be state-sponsored hacking he said.

He said the majority of cyberattacks reported to his lab are conducted by criminal groups in Eastern Europe that are specifically attacking North American targets.

LISTEN | Expert says the agriculture industry needs to do more to protect tech and data.

Unsecure devices 'easy targets'

Hackers may not always be looking at the targets but people — farmers or otherwise — who don't keep their devices up to date or have security measures in place are ""weak targets"" Dehghantanha said.

""Unfortunately due to lack of any security standard or security guideline in [the agriculture] field we are seeing so many unpatched devices … they are easy targets for the hackers.""

Janos Botschner is the lead investigator for the Cyber Security Capacity in Canadian Agriculture project through the Community Safety Knowledge Alliance a non-profit that looks at ways to improve community safety and well-being.

The project is looking to help the sector prevent cyberattacks but also develop tools to help build cybersecurity in Canadian agriculture. Over the last two years the first-of-its-kind project has surveyed Canadian producers about cybersecurity.

""Digital ag cybersecurity is still in its infancy globally. So it's both a weakness and an opportunity for accelerated capacity building within the sector"" Botschner said.

He said for many the level of awareness around cybersecurity is ""not a priority among most producers"" at this point but it needs to be.

He pointed to recent cyber threats to the sector including a warning from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in April this year that included the United Kingdom and Australia. It warned agriculture co-operatives to be on high alert for ransomware attacks.

The threat of a cyberattack also hit home for farmers in Quebec last month when L'Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) a farmers' union announced it was the victim of a ransomware attack on Aug. 7.

A statement on the union's website said it's still reviewing the scale of the attack and possible ways to restore its computer systems. The UPA noted ""day-to-day activities"" of agricultural businesses were not compromised and it was doing all it could to protect people's personal information.

Farm family networks often connected

For many people a ransomware attack impacts them on an individual level. But the attack can be a bigger problem for farmers Botschner said.

""Farm businesses are not like other businesses.""

An attack ""could have an impact on their farm business as well as on their farm family because … many networks are not segregated between the home and the agricultural operation.""

Lennon said she's also heard from farmers who reported a company they do business with had been attacked.

""People have had their names addresses and credit cards hacked when a local business was attacked and that certainly caused concern and awareness on the farm level about making sure that you are protecting that information.""

An attack could also 'sow mistrust'

But Botschner said cyberattacks can be more than ransomware or phishing for information. There could be attacks where information rather than physical computer systems is disrupted he said.

""You could see information being contaminated to either mask an event like an emerging biosecurity threat like a virus"" Bortschner said.

""Or you could see information being contaminated to suggest that something's happening that has contaminated a commodity in order to sow mistrust in a critical part of our ag food system. You could also see disinformation campaigns being rolled out to undermine trust in Canada's food system.""

Those kinds of attacks may not happen quickly — it could take years as part of a strategic campaign.

He said people should think of food security as national security.

""If farmers are under threat then so are the rest of us.""

Tips for farmers

Lennon said the OFA offers tech safety tips to members including:

Use strong passwords and a password manager.

Be careful about sharing personal information on social media.

Keep devices up to date.

The federation is planning an in-person annual general meeting in November when it will hold a workshop on protecting farmers from cyberattacks.

Cathy Lennon of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture says the OFA is working to teach farmers about how to protect themselves from cyberattacks. (Ontario Chamber of Commerce/occ.ca)

She said a key message to all farmers is that any device can be compromised.

""There's folks that have highly technical equipment in the barn or in their computers at home. GPS technology. It's the full range but if you are connected to the internet then the risk exists.""

Government tech companies can do more

Dehghantanha said while farmers themselves need to ensure they're protecting their data and devices regulators also have a role to play.

There's a need for a standard cybersecurity guideline for the agriculture industry ""so different people farmers technology providers service providers are at least aware of what [is the] security standard what security activities they should do and they should follow.""

Botschner agrees.

""Canadian producers are very adaptable. They're very good risk managers. They're good at noticing things that might involve risks and threats"" he said.

""But there are other things that need to be done to support farmers because they shouldn't be in it alone.""

He said governments and major tech companies can work together to help farmers improve their safety online while focusing on ensuring critical infrastructure is safeguarded from threats.

It's a sort of ""cyber barn raising"" he said ""to help one another tackle this important challenge in ways that make sense for producers and that really help the sector as a whole to be more resilient.""",,,

Because our voices and visibility matter Delta Airlines is a company committed to showing the diversity among travelers worldwide with its ‘Faces of Travel’ initiative.

This past Wednesday the airline announced a partnership with computer software company Adobe releasing a series of stock images to combat the lack of diversity in travel advertising. The digital library “Faces of Travel” includes 100 stock images that represents a more “inclusive and accurate view” of travelers of color worldwide.

‍Studies show that when marginalized groups aren’t able to see themselves in the media it has a drastic and negative impact on their ideas of self-worth.

“Faces of Travel was designed to better reflect the diverse customers we see on our planes every day and ensure they feel seen and heard in broader travel culture” says Shannon Womack Delta’s Director of Lifecycle Marketing.

“The importance of this initiative goes beyond Delta and we want to encourage others to take part in this movement because we know that it will take all of us to truly reflect the faces of travel.”

Delta and Adobe worked with Black-owned creative agency Kin and photographer Seo Ju Park to create 100 dynamic images which are reflective of a more inclusive view of what travelers look like.

Adobe amplified the collection to its 3 million users making this diverse and inclusive imagery widely accessible to content creators journalists and others in the industry.

Context: New ‘Strive and Rise Programme’ to fight cross-generational poverty

Start-up sum of HK$5000 will be handed out to 2000 students who will also be paired with life-planning mentors

Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki is leading a pilot “Strive and Rise Programme” aimed to help underprivileged pupils expand their social networks build communication skills and plan their finances and careers. The scheme is set to launch in October and expected to last a year.

The subsidy scheme is part of the new government’s efforts to alleviate poverty. According to Chan under the first phase of the subsidy scheme a start-up sum of HK$5000 will be given to 2000 Form One to Three students who live in subdivided flats. If more than 2000 applications are received preference will be given to Form Three students.

“Some may ask why only 2000 students will benefit. This is a trial programme. We will expand it to cover more students after an ongoing review” Chan said.

Hong Kong’s new scheme to mentor pupils living in subdivided flats

Authorities will invite commercial organisations and professional bodies to nominate mentors. Students in the programme will be recruited through community groups and schools. Mentors will help pupils with planning their lives and making the best use of the subsidies donated by the business sector.

“We hope to recruit more younger mentors because they can communicate better with the mentees. They should have a job and can arrange job shadowing” Chan said. “We hope the mentors can also be able to share with their mentees how they faced difficulties in order to help mentees develop a positive attitude.”

Upon completion of the programme another HK$5000 will be awarded to students to fund their personal pursuits.

Activities for pupils would include group visits to public utilities government departments and museums. There are also plans for them to take a short flight. Participants will also undergo compulsory training in areas such as communication skills and financial planning. Mentors and parents will also be given training. Pupils can choose to take classes in Chinese or English language sports and music as well as social etiquette.

News: Hong Kong Olympic medal winners to act as tutors under new scheme

Hong Kong Olympic medallists among mentors in “Strive and Rise” scheme

Scheme serves as “short- to medium-term subsidy” rather than long-term support Form Three pupil says

Four Hong Kong Olympic medallists have been invited to act as tutors to junior secondary school pupils living in subdivided flats under a new scheme to tackle cross-generational poverty.

They are fencing gold medallist Edgar Cheung Ka-long and women’s table tennis team members Doo Hoi-kam Minnie Soo Wai-yam and Lee Ho-ching who took home a bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games.

“These star tutors will increase the attractiveness of the scheme so that grass-roots students will no longer feel that their development will be restricted by their network” he said.

Others who have agreed to join the scheme as tutors are Dr Lo Yuen-yi the University of Hong Kong’s associate dean of faculty of education Hong Kong Harmonica Association founder Ho Pak-cheong renowned conductor Yip Wing-sze and violinist Yao Jue.

Form Three pupil Kelly Lee said she was interested in joining the scheme but its quota was too small the duration too short and the HK$10000 subsidy too little.

“This is not a form of long-term support it is more of a short- to medium-term subsidy” said the 14-year-old who lives in a subdivided flat.

Using her violin lessons as an example she said a new instrument would cost at least HK$10000 and the average fee for a class was around HK$300 to HK$400.

She said she hoped the scheme would help her to plan her future career path and to visit events and places she had rarely been to such as concerts or theme parks.

Separately Sze Lai-shan deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation said the scheme was a move in the right direction but the one-year period was not long enough for mentors and mentees to develop a relationship. Sze added that the subsidy should be increased to HK$20000 per student and more pupils should be allowed to join.

Issue: Scheme for disadvantaged Hong Kong youth does not go far enough experts say

Academics warn “Strive and Rise” scheme will not tackle problems of intergenerational poverty on its own

More long-term commitment needed to ensure underprivileged children are lifted out of poverty cycle

The “Strive and Rise Programme” designed to help lift struggling Hong Kong secondary school pupils out of poverty is “half-baked” experts have said.

Academics and social workers insisted that the government-organised scheme was not enough on its own and other major problems such as the housing crisis and low incomes had to be tackled as well.

“There must be elements of continuity in the scheme” said Amy Chan Kung Wai-ying the chairwoman of the Child Development Matching Fund a charity that has worked with the government to deliver similar programmes since 2009. “The government should provide a ladder for them and also keep helping them move up along the way.”

According to Chan the scheme was too career-focused for such young children and the programme would not achieve its aims without follow-up measures. She appealed to authorities to allocate resources for continued support to the secondary pupils involved who would need guidance for several years.

Experts have also blamed worsening intergenerational poverty on the city’s growing income gap soaring cost of living and limited help programmes.

Lee Chun-wing a social sciences lecturer at Polytechnic University accused the government of a lack of new ideas and follow-up measures. “It’s a half-baked plan as the government delivered no new ideas and no solid plans on tracking the progress of students” he said.

Why low-income Hongkongers are being pushed from one temporary flat to another

Lee said authorities tended to attribute intergenerational poverty to youngsters’ lack of social skills and limited opportunities but the problem’s causes were more complex. He explained there was a critical need to review the city’s employment structure to close the poverty gap and boost the incomes of low-paid workers.

Lee also appealed for more immediate measures to be taken to improve living conditions for poorer schoolchildren so they had a suitable home environment to concentrate on their studies.

Sample answers

Context:

Why is the “Strive and Rise Programme” only applicable to students who live in subdivided flats? Use Glossary and your own knowledge to explain. (It is because this group of people are living in poverty and are likely to have the least financial means and access to the activities provided in the scheme. They are also more likely to face financial or other sorts of difficulties in their lives and they will benefit from the mentors’ advice.

Which of the activities mentioned in Context do you think would benefit recipients of the scheme and why? (Training in terms of communication skills and financial planning because they will most likely be unable to afford such classes otherwise. These skills are also crucial for future success.)

News:

Do you think recruiting the four Hong Kong Olympians as mentors increases the attractiveness of the scheme? Explain. (Yes these athletes are inspirational figures for the city’s youth and they have each excelled in their respective sports. All of them are also under 30 and they will be able to better relate to the mentees.)

Why does Kelly Lee say the programme is “more of a short- to medium-term subsidy” than long-term support? Use Context News and Glossary to explain. (Having only 2000 spots is not enough to help the city’s 275000 youth living in poverty. HK$10000 is also too little to fund worthwhile pursuits such as enrolling in enrichment classes or starting their own business ventures. At the end of the day none of this addresses the root causes of their struggles.)

Issue:

What does Amy Chan mean when she says there must be “elements of continuity in the scheme”? Explain your answer using News and Issue. (She means that the “Strive and Rise Programme” should not simply be a one-year subsidy scheme and its duration should be extended to that of a long-term programme. This way students’ progress can be tracked to ensure that they truly benefit from it. As mentioned by Kelly Lee in News even though she is interested in the scheme the duration is barely enough for her to explore the possibility of a future career in music.)

Using your own knowledge and Glossary explain how widening income gap soaring cost of living and lack of help programmes cause intergenerational poverty. (Intergenerational poverty is passed on from one generation to the next. A widening income gap combined with soaring cost of living means that low-wage workers are not paid enough to maintain basic needs. If a parent does not make enough money to pay for rent for example then their children may struggle to focus on their studies when their home environment is unstable. These individuals may rely on the government to provide financial assistance but when there are not enough help programmes they have no choice but to fend for themselves.)

Cartoon:

Which group of people could the cat represent? (The task force in charge of the scheme / Wealthy people with a lot of power in the city)

What is the cat asking the kid to do and why is this tough for the kid? (The cat is asking the kid to get up while sitting on him making it hard for him to follow the instructions.)

What is the cartoon’s attitude towards the “Strive and Rise Programme” and why? Explain using News and Issue. (It expresses scepticism towards the scheme as shown by the cat sitting on the student while asking him to “strive and rise”. This reflects the lack of thought in the “half-baked” scheme as mentioned by the experts in News and Issue.

Heavy smoke could be seen from our Norfolk tower cameras as seen in the below Facebook Live.

Neighbors off Church Street are saddened to see their local Family Dollar store up in smoke. But employees tell our News 3 reporter Kelsey Jones that if they didn't act quickly the situation could've been much worse.

""It was like a blast like a bomb"" said a customer who was inside Family Dollar.

The customer said ""It was a big explosion inside the building. That's when I start moving behind the door of the employees and when I come out the store the windows just explode out and a bunch of black smoke just came everywhere.""

This all happening at the shopping center in the 700 block of Church Street Monday afternoon. Crews were dispatched at 5:25 p.m. and a second alarm was called by 5:33 p.m.

""You have so much stuff in there that's easy to catch a fire"" said the customer.

Norfolk Fire and Rescue has not released details on what sparked the fire. Our reporter Kelsey Jones caught up with the assistant manager at Family Dollar. He would not comment on how the fire started but says within seconds he called 9-1-1.

""I started yelling fire and made sure all staff and customers were exiting the building. I attempted with a fire extinguisher to put it out but it was out of control"" said Jay Family Dollar assistant manager.

Kelsey Jones asked residents ""Is this a big loss for the community?""

""Yes it is! Because basically this is the only store that they can come shop at to get some milk cereal different stuff like that"" said a concerned resident.

There is still an open investigation looking into the cause of the fire that forced the Family Dollar location to close according to a spokesperson for Norfolk Fire-Rescue. The spokesperson told News 3 ""The fire appears to be an intentionally set fire on a display shelf near the front of the store.""

Florence Pugh is a shining star in Venice.

The “Don’t Worry Darling” actress wowed in an off-the-shoulder black tulle gown by Valentino Haute Couture for the movie’s premiere at the Venice Film Festival Monday night — looking unbothered amid the drama involving her and director Olivia Wilde.

Miss Flo 26 posed confidently in the shimmery creation which featured voluminous balloon-style sleeves and a stunning split front.

The sheer overlay which was scattered with both round and star-shaped silver sequins finished in a sweeping train as she walked the red carpet.

Underneath the “Little Women” actress sported a black bandeau bra top and high-waisted boy shorts also covered in the same sequin pattern — a departure from the controversial nipple-baring dress she rocked at the Valentino Haute Couture show in July.

She wore her hair in a simple slicked-back wave and accessorized her glam gown with black heels featuring a bow at the ankle and dramatic feather trim going up her legs.

Pugh — who recently slammed fans who only seem to care about her sex scenes with Harry Styles in the movie — added some serious sparkle with plenty of Tiffany & Co. gems. She wore a platinum-and-diamond collar necklace diamond cluster earrings and two Schlumberger rings including one with an over-9-carat blue spinel and the other with an over-4-carat aquamarine.

Earlier Monday the actress rocked another Valentino look for her highly anticipated arrival in Venice. The all-purple ensemble featured shorts a bandeau top and a matching unbuttoned shirt over top.

TEEN MOM fans have expressed being divided over Chelsea Houska's new HGTV bio which labels the ex-MTV star as an ""actress"" and ""global inspiration.""

HGTV recently posted Chelsea's biography in preparation for the Teen Mom 2 alum's home renovation series Farmhouse Fabulous.

Set to premiere in the spring of 2023 each hour-long episode will feature Chelsea 31 and her husband Cole Deboer 34 assisting another family through the construction and ""design process.""

Per the Home and Garden Television network the former MTV star is described as an ""actress"" ""Instagram sensation"" and a ""global inspiration for women and young moms everywhere.""

Chelsea's show bio was reposted on a popular Teen Mom Reddit board where fans were quick to take exception to the labels afforded to the mother-of-four.

One fan commented: ""Actress? Global inspiration?! What the heck.""

A second person wrote: ""This is like when you fluff up your resume.""

""Such a strange type-up about them. It's the content I would expect Jenelle [Evans] to write about herself"" added a third.

Another commenter chimed: ""I didn't read on after they called her an actress because I knew it was all a lie.""

Chelsea's title of ""actress"" was a topic of constant confusion throughout the post's comment thread too.

One fan questioned ""Actress?"" while another laughingly stated ""Actress lmao...""

'GLOBAL INSPIRATION'

Other fans chose to focus on the reality star being described as a ""global inspiration"" as one Redditor questioned: ""Fan favorite and global inspiration... Did Cole write this?

""'Instagram sensation' is a bit much... she has a lot of followers because of the show"" added another fan.

One Redditor provided a possible explanation for the ""generous description"" writing: ""I can’t speak for HGTV or even TV in general but I do work in a similar industry. Usually blurbs like this are written by the individual.""

Another defended: ""It seems people here disagree but I'll check it out....""

""I actually dig Chelsea and her story I’m here for it...."" one added.

FREE FURNITURE

Chelsea's manager has admitted the TV personality received furniture decor and other home items for free while building her South Dakota farmhouse.

Chelsea and Cole bought land and built their South Dakota farmhouse as the family moved into the dream home in early 2021.

The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed that the couple received many free items during the building process including paint furniture decor and more.

The social media deals were mentioned in Chelsea and Cole’s $3million lawsuit.

The duo was sued by consulting company Envy for $3million for allegedly withholding money made from social media promotions.

The information was revealed in Chelsea and Cole's manager William Dzombak’s deposition taken on August 18 2022.

In the court papers obtained by The U.S. Sun William was asked: “So what materials did they receive as part of promotions branding licensing et cetera? Beyond just rugs the actual building materials that they received?”

William responded: “The only thing they would have received is [Sherwin-Williams] paint and railings.”

He added that Chelsea and Cole also received paint primer in exchange for “some sort of social media post” according to the manager.

He was then asked: “What was the arrangement between Down Home DeBoers and Montgomery's Interiors?”

William answered: “They probably provided some home furnishings. I'm not sure exactly what.”

William added that the couple also received bedding from company Beddy’s.

In addition to the sheets and comforter William “assumed” during the deposition that the couple also received “payment” for certain posts.

Chelsea and Cole’s Instagram Down Home Deboers promoted various items and companies to their over 700000 followers.

DREAM HOUSE

Chelsea and Cole bought a plot of land in Vermillion South Dakota and began building on it in early 2020.

They updated fans on the building and decor process.

The farmhouse has hardwood floors throughout.

The kitchen has white cabinets with a black island for contrast stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.

The living room has a black brick fireplace and ceiling-length windows while the home has modern farmhouse vibes throughout.

FARMHOUSE FABULOUS

As previously mentioned Chelsea and Cole snagged a new HGTV show called Farmhouse Fabulous after building the home.

The series which is set to debut in 2023 will follow the couple as they help families renovate their homes.

Chelsea and Cole have filmed for the series as they shared photos and videos of their renovations with fans.

The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority said it would consider making a digital hub like the Dubai virtual free zone Bloomberg reported Sunday (Sept. 4). The government made regulations this year for trade in digital assets while Nigeria Exchange will start a blockchain-enabled platform to boost trade.

Nigerians have had a greater interest in crypto than any other country since the digital assets started to decline in April CoinGecko reported. The country is one of the most prosperous nations on the continent and has been looking into ways to diversify its economy from its reliance on crude oil.

The younger more connected populace seems to be a way for the country to do that as FinTechs like Interswitch and Flutterwave have emerged there and gotten billion-dollar-plus valuations.

Nigeria also rolled out a new digital currency last year with the country pushing to get 8 million users to adopt the eNaira up from a yearlong total of 840000.

The country’s central bank wants to reach this goal by attracting those without bank accounts. Many Nigerians have been turning to crypto as the naira loses value even in spite of a warning by the central bank that commercial lenders have had to stop crypto transactions.

“Just like the naira the eNaira is expected to be available to all Nigerians and will provide more possibilities to bring the unbanked into the digital economy” Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Godwin Emefiele said.

The eNaira had around 270000 active uses as of the report which was compared to the 33.4 million Nigerians who have either owned or traded in crypto. Nigerians had traded around $400 million as of June this year according to PYMNTS.

To estimate the size of the market Technavio has tracked the recent trends and developments in the dog food market. The analysts at Technavio have considered various aspects such as the consumer base adoption rate average selling price revenue generated by vendors and various other factors to estimate the market size. Download Sample PDF Report Here to get an idea of the overall scope of the full report.

Technavio has announced its latest market research report titled Global Dog Food Market 2022-2026

The report on the dog food market by Technavio expects the market size to increase at a CAGR of 4.27% and register an incremental growth of USD 12.84 billion between 2021 and 2026. However the growth forecast could be missed with the market growing slower than expected if the following factors come into play: changing lifestyle patterns and busy work lives of the urban populace and limited choice of frozen foods.

According to Technavio the growth of the market is primarily driven by increasing pet health awareness.

With rising disposable incomes people are more inclined to provide a better lifestyle for their pets. They are learning about how to better take care and feed an animal. This has increased the awareness of pet health among consumers which is driving the demand for pet food that is free from grains dyes sugar preservatives and other chemical additives. All these factors are expected to foster the growth of the market during the forecast period.

""Rise in product visibility and accessibility through online retailing and increasing focus on manufacturing clean-label pet foods will further accelerate the growth of the market"" says an analyst at Technavio.

The market structure is fragmented. The market has the presence of several global regional and local vendors. Additionally factors such as the low cost of switching products for buyers high product perishability high exit barriers and high fixed cost requirements intensify the threat of rivalry in the market. As a result the threat of rivalry was moderate in 2021 and it is expected to remain the same during the forecast period.

The report breaks down the market into the following segments:

Product: dry dog food dog treats and wet dog food

Geography: North America  Europe  APAC MEA and South America

Based on the product the dry dog food segment is expected to create more revenue in the market. The segment is driven by the increasing focus of vendors on offering dog food products in attractive packaging and other packaging innovations. In addition vendors operating in the segment are adopting strategies such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and product innovations to expand their consumer base. This will further drive the growth of the segment.

In terms of region North America will emerge as the dominant region occupying 33% of the global market share. The regional market is mainly driven by the increasing production of clean-label pet food products and the move toward innovative and sustainable packaging materials by manufacturers.

Steve Irwin's daughter Bindi has paid an emotional to the Crocodile Hunter star on the 16th anniversary of his death.

The 24-year-old has followed in her dad's footsteps with his love for wild animals and took to Instagram on Sunday to share how his love for animals also lives through her daughter.

Bindi opened up to her 4.9 million followers to share her heartfelt words alongside a snap of her and her dad on a late-night adventure as she proudly held a baby alligator. She also shared the sweet nickname she refers him to to her daughter 17-month-old Grace who she shares with husband Chandler Powell.

She wrote: ""Grandpa Crocodile I know you would’ve been the most incredible grandfather because you were such an extraordinary dad. Thank you for being an amazing guardian angel for Grace.""

Fans were quick to share their appreciation for the family in the comments section of the post. One user wrote: ""You carry all his love with you now.""

Another penned: ""He gave this world such a gift by sharing his life with us. I'm sure Grace will think of him as a superhero as she grows and she'll be right. He was extraordinary and so are you.""

And a third said: ""Your father will be proud of who you are right now.""

Steve died in 2006 at the age of 44 after a stingray barb stabbed him in the chest while he was filming for a wildlife documentary. Bindi was aged eight at the time.

Her brother Robert was just two-years-old. He too posted on social media on Sunday saying: ""It's Father's Day today in Australia and I am sending my love to those who are missing their dad today. I cherish all the good times with my dad and feel grateful to be able to keep his memory and legacy alive.""

Their posts come a week after Bindi had uploaded another sweet video of her daughter. The clip showed Grace walking up to a mural of Steve his wife and a koala bear.

She captioned the post: ""Tears in my eyes as I share this video. We call my mum and dad Bunny and Grandpa Crocodile with Grace. She loves them (and koalas) dearly.

Chris and Matt Shown of Brigadoon Wine Co. in front of the vineyard the family began planting near Junction City in 1993. (Photo by Michael Alberty/Photo by Michael Alberty)

When people ask me to suggest a quality “under the radar” Oregon winery the first word from my mouth is always “Brigadoon.” The Junction City winery is where Chris and Sheree Shown along with their winemaker son Matt work their magic.

Thankfully unlike the mythical Scottish village of the same name Brigadoon’s tasting room opens more frequently than once every 100 years.

Brigadoon Wine Co. is known for: “My dad” Matt Shown said. “The first five years that the tasting room was open he was behind the counter for 99% of the shifts.”

Shown said that because of the presence of his dad and his mother’s fantastic parmesan cheese crackers in the tasting room few people realized he had been making the family’s wines from the beginning. “I was an afterthought. ‘When did you start making the wines?’ was a question I’d get all the time Shown said.

HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok

I can’t blame those people for their oversight because his dad is quite a storyteller and his mom’s crackers will cast a spell on you.

I should also add that Brigadoon produces some of the best rieslings in all of Oregon.

A “must try” current release: 2021 Brigadoon Wine Co. “Lylee” Pinot Noir ($26).

The last vintage of this wine was a superb pinot noir value. Citing its “generous fruit” Shown thinks his 2021 “Lylee” is even better.

Innovation: The Shown family has a rootstock and scion wood nursery on their property not something you typically see at a winery.

Rootstock is the below-ground portion of the grapevine that works to keep the scion wood productive. The scion wood is the above-ground part of the vine that produces the fruit.

For various reasons vineyard owners began steadily moving away from “own-rooted” grapevines to grafting scion wood onto rootstock. The Showns capitalized on that trend by growing and selling rootstock/scion to nursery customers across the country. At the peak of their business in 2005 the Showns were selling 200000 cuttings a year.

History: The Shown family wine history does not begin in Oregon. Richard Shown Chris’ dad and Matt’s grandfather first started dabbling with winemaking in a bomb shelter he built in his backyard in Santa Clara California.

In the late 1960s the bomb shelter was vacated when the family went commercial and set up shop near Rutherford as Shown & Sons Vineyards. The Shown’s Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon frequently earned high praise from the critics.

When Shown & Sons closed the winery and vineyard were sold to Joe Heitz who changed the name to Heitz Cellar Trailside Vineyard.

In 1990 with a good deal of viticultural experience under his belt Chris Shown moved his family to Oregon. In 1991 Chris and Sheree Shown purchased a timber property where they built Brigadoon’s winery and tasting room.

Early on Chris Shown’s day job was managing another vineyard in the Junction City area. Taking what his son called a “weekend warrior” approach it took Shown 15 years to plant 15 acres of grapevines. In fact Brigadon’s vineyard wasn’t completed until one year after the winery was finished in 2008.

What we don’t know: Chris Shown was an enthusiastic rugby hooker in college.

Key insight: Matt Shown said that many Willamette Valley winery owners talked about “surveying the valley for the best possible place to grow pinot noir.” His dad took a different approach.

“He looked for a piece of land that he could afford where he could raise a family and live a happy life. His vision wasn’t necessarily grand but it was pure” Shown said.

Biggest success so far: Matt Shown said that while it wasn’t always easy early on he thinks his biggest success is getting to work all day with his dad and now that she’s retired from teaching his mom. “Most people say they could never work with their parents and I get that. But we’ve made it work” Shown said.

A “must visit” spot near Brigadoon: After the wine and crackers Matt Shown recommends driving 20 minutes north of Brigadoon to visit the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge.

The wildlife refuge features beautiful scenery wetlands trails elk migrating birds and what Shown said is “an opportunity to glimpse what the Willamette Valley looked like 20 years ago.”

Where to buy: In addition to purchasing from the winery Brigadoon’s wines are available at The Broadway Wine Merchants in Eugene The Good Drop Wine Shoppe in Bend Vino Veritas in Portland and Made in Oregon stores.

Noon-5 p.m. Wednesday-Monday Brigadoon Wine Co. 25167 Ferguson Road Junction City brigadoonwineco.com or 541-998-2600.

You've just allowed a fellow passenger to send you a nude photo.

Now you wonder which one of the passengers it could be.

But you weren't the only one to get the pic.

""So here's the deal: if this continues while we're on the ground I'm going to have to pull back to the gate"" the pilot said.

""Everybody's gonna have to get off we're gonna have to get security involved and vacation is gonna be ruined""

""So you folks whatever that 'AirDrop' thing is quit sending naked pictures and let's get yourselves to Cabo.""

Yes this really did happen.

And no he didn't have to turn around the plane.

That passenger did give his ""Airdrop thing"" a rest for the remainder of the flight.

Southwest Airlines has since released the following statement:

""The safety security and well-being of customers and employees is the southwest team's highest priority at all times

""When made aware of a potential problem our employees address issues to support the comfort of those traveling with us.""

Luckily for that passenger - whether an accident or on purpose the situation was handled on the plane.

Southwest diverted a flight with an unaccompanied eight-year-old but didn't tell her family.

Ara Zoser said her niece was ""scared and hungry"" when she finally managed to get her on the phone.

The airline offered a $150 voucher but Zoser said it didn't take responsibility for the diversion.

Southwest diverted a flight that had an unaccompanied minor aged eight on board – but failed to let her family know.

On August 22 Ara Zoser's niece boarded a direct flight from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta bound for LaGuardia New York. The flight was due to land at 5:40 p.m.

An hour after that time her mother Regine called Zoser in a panic after the flight had been diverted to Baltimore-Washington airport in Maryland.

She told Insider that Regine received no notice of this flight change and another family member had been waiting for the child's arrival at the airport. ""Regine could not get in contact with Southwest as they were receiving an unusually high call volume causing long than normal wait times.""

""I then called Southwest as well as tweeting them while I was on hold. There was still no word of my niece's status of wellbeing nor any reason why the flight was diverted"" Zoser said.

Zoser waited and after about an hour she was able to get in touch with a ""very helpful customer service representative."" Zoser waited on the line until the child came on the phone.

""My niece was scared and hungry in an unfamiliar place with no reasoning. She is only eight years old"" Zoser said.

There were four other unaccompanied minors on the flight along with her. They were given food vouchers at some point but Zoser said her niece did not reach LaGuardia until well after midnight.

Southwest offered a $150 flight voucher to Zoser's sister but ""refused to take responsibility for not contacting Regine about the whereabouts of her only child and not be forthcoming with information as her mother had to venture through many loopholes to finally speak to her daughter"" she said.

Southwest did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Pilot threatens to pull flight after passenger airdrops nude photos to other fliers,"The pilot of a Southwest Airlines flight from Houston Texas to Cabo San Lucas Mexico threatened to deplane after a passenger airdropped a naked picture to other passengers.

In a video posted on TikTok the pilot can be heard threatening to call security and force passengers to leave the aircraft.

So here’s the deal if this continues while we’re on the ground I’m going to have to pull back to the gate everybody’s going to have to get off we’re going to have to get security involved and … vacation is going to be ruined. Southwest Airlines pilot

The TikTok video has more than 2.7 million views.

The video was shot by passenger Teighlor Marsalis who told CNN that she received the unsolicited nude photos via AirDrop immediately after she and boarded the plane. She added that she declined the file but that two other passengers seated in front of her accepted the transfer and showed her the photo of a nude man.

It was a nude man that had AirDropped himself to everyone. Passenger Teighlor Marsalis

Some passengers reported what had happened to a flight attendant who immediately notified the pilot.

At that point Marsalis started filming the scene. According to the passenger the Southwest Airlines pilot handled the situation in a very professional way. In her video caption Marsalis said the pilot “takes AirDropping nudes very seriously.”

After the cabin crew went through some safety procedures the plane finally took off. No more file transfers were reported during the flightSee the TikTok video here."

The goal: “Buy small and tip large.”

“The service industry can be an exploitive business practice” said Connor Alguire a 23-year-old barista. “We aren’t getting paid enough with the amount of work that we’re doing especially when you’re trying to pay bills like student debt.”

Alguire works at the Starbucks at 22nd and South streets and is a member of Starbucks Workers United. He’s also worked as a union organizer for a month and says that the efforts Starbucks corporation has made to raise wages and protect workers’ rights have not been enough.

“We need to come together and make sure that we’re advocating for ourselves and advocating for our rights” he said.

“Sip-ins” are a nationwide coordinated effort by Starbucks Workers United to draw customer support for considering the employees first. The tactic encourages customers who walk in the store to skip the coffee grab a free cup of water but still tip the workers — large.

But even customers who do buy coffee tip generously to support baristas and servers.

“It’s really wonderful having customers come in and say ‘It’s really wonderful that you’re starting a union’” Alguire said. “It’s very validating as a service industry worker and I think this can speak to people even outside of the Starbucks corporation. I think it’s a really strong message that the community stands for workers’ rights.”

Two customers Brian Rosario 19 and David Diaz Garcia 19 are both Swarthmore College sophomores who came to show their support for Starbucks employees at 22nd and South streets — they only bought water and juice and still tipped.

“I’ve been trying to be more active in my community” Rosario said. “I feel like unionizing is a right that we all should have. I’m originally from New York and one of the first Starbucks to get unionized was in Buffalo. So that was a pretty big thing.”

Starbucks workers formed their first union in Buffalo in December. A Starbucks in the Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh became the first store in Pennsylvania to unionize in April. More than 200 Starbucks stores across the country have formed unions.

The “sip-ins” come after a summer of several Center City Starbucks stores fighting to unionize. Employees city-wide have cited refusal to allow union representation and reduced hours as reasons for going on strike and expanding union support. Many Center City Starbucks employees are receiving broad community support including from Democratic Socialists of America who have been among Starbucks Workers United’s strongest allies.

Sam Layding 25 is a graduate hospital resident pursuing a doctorate in chemical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. He’s also a member of Philly Democratic Socialists of America and has worked alongside members of Starbucks Workers United for months.

“It’s an important fight because it’s a job that somebody’s gotta do” he said. “The person who does that job deserves to be treated with dignity and respect by not only the people that they’re serving but the people that are employing them.”

Layding said that most Starbucks employees he’s organized with are concerned about their future job security. He also said that while the Starbucks organization has often presented itself as “progressive” its actions are anything but and there’s a disconnect.

“The wages and the job security is not really commensurate with the economic situation that we’re facing as a country right now” he said.” I think that they [Starbucks] have demonstrated that they’re not really able to respond to the needs of their workers as far as fair wages and living wages without the pressure of facing unionization.”

Philly Democratic Socialists of America board chair Shawn Hogan 27 said that their chapter will continue to support Starbucks Workers United in Philly to expand its impact.

“They’ve said jump in and we’ve said ‘How high?’” she said. “We know what we’re good at and what we can help out with. Whatever reasons that workers want and need to organize we’re going to be here to support them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL2xhdy1qdXN0aWNlL2xhd3N1aXQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWdpZnQtY2FyZC1wb2xpY3ktZGVjZXB0aXZlLWRpc2NvdXJhZ2VzLWNhc2gtcmVkZW1wdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks gift card policy ‘deceptive’ federal lawsuit claims,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

It was nurtured by activists like Jaz Brisack – who took a break between the successful effort to organize Spot workers in 2019 and starting a job at Starbucks for a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford University.

Starbucks unionization effort grows since its start by the 'brave baristas in Buffalo' Starbucks union organizers from Buffalo met virtually Wednesday with their friends in Congress: the House Labor Caucus. And afterward they spoke of the growing unionization effort now as every bit of a challenge as it has been from the beginning.

And it took root during the pandemic which emboldened front-line workers especially in low-paying positions who stayed on the job while office workers toiled from home.

Now nine months after the first Buffalo Starbucks stores voted to unionize the local organizing effort has turned into a nationwide push that has led to more than 200 Starbucks locations voting to join Starbucks Workers United.

How it started – and why it succeeded – has a lot to do with the Buffalo Niagara region itself and its history as a union town. It has a lot to do with a dedicated cadre of Starbucks union activists who used their Spot Coffee experience to mount a more daunting organizing effort with a much bigger target. And it has a lot to do with the new feelings of empowerment that front-line workers developed during the pandemic.

Starbucks workers in Buffalo vote to join union Workers at a Starbucks store in Buffalo voted to join a union making it the first company-owned store in the United States to organize.

What makes the union campaign at Starbucks so unusual is that fast-food chains are notoriously difficult to organize. Workers come and go so quickly it is difficult to build a core of committed union activists. But leaders at Workers United of Upstate New York would soon find that Starbucks’ progressive reputation draws progressive workers – those with a keen sense of social justice and politics that lean pro-worker and pro-union.

Overcoming obstacles

Despite the industry's high turnover some Buffalo Starbucks organizers had a decade or more of tenure which helped.

Even more important workers had a familiarity with unions. Though union membership has slipped here as it has elsewhere Buffalo has a strong history as a union town. Many Starbucks workers have family members in unions but even those who don’t still have an appreciation for what unions are how they work and what they mean.

It is a far cry from what Amazon organizers faced as they tried to unionize in Alabama – a right-to-work state with no labor history and a strong anti-union bent. Union membership in Alabama is half the national average.

What to watch for next after Starbucks union election in Buffalo In the months and years ahead the unionized workers will try to secure their first contract. Their success – or failure – could influence whether more Starbucks stores across the country could try to become unionized.

It is the opposite in the Buffalo Niagara region. While just one of every nine workers across the country belongs to a union organized labor has a much stronger foothold in the Buffalo Niagara region where more than one of every five workers is a union member.

Starbucks pulled out all the stops in Buffalo and fought the union hard. It was crucial to the union’s cause that Workers United was funded well enough to fight Starbucks’ court challenges at every turn.

The union also benefited when some of Starbucks’ anti-union tactics began to backfire – most spectacularly when CEO Howard Schultz compared himself to Holocaust victims while addressing Buffalo workers.

""I knew the campaign would take off naturally because conditions were explosive"" said Richard Bensinger senior adviser to the Starbucks Workers United campaign and the former organizing director for the AFL-CIO.

Starting at Spot

Starbucks aims to delay union vote as organizers target more stores Workers United which is seeking to organize workers at three stores is preparing to announce its campaign has ""expanded to even more stores.""

A big first step happened at Spot Coffee – a smaller chain than Starbucks that put up a smaller fight and whose unionization fortified Starbucks workers’ resolve.

It started with Gary Bonadonna Jr. at Workers United Upstate New York. He believed the time was getting ripe to organize restaurant workers unhappy with wages and working conditions. And he had an idea for how to take a different strategic tack to organize them.

""We chose to have a geographical organizing model for this segment of the economy "" said Bonadonna manager and international vice president of Workers United.

The focus started on cafes but Starbucks was never the original goal. Neither was Buffalo. The plans were to stay in Rochester where Workers United has its headquarters.

""I thought Buffalo was too big"" Bensinger said.

Union expands effort to organize Starbucks stores The union on Tuesday said it was filing petitions with the National Labor Relations Board to conduct votes at Starbucks stores at 4770 Transit Road in Depew 3186 Sheridan Drive in Amherst and 1775 Walden Ave. in Cheektowaga.

But Buffalo baristas caught wind of the union’s victories with smaller Rochester cafes and began contacting Workers United.

""Finally we said 'If they want a union let's help them get a union'"" Bensinger said.

The organizer on the Spot campaign was Brizack a University of Mississippi graduate who had been mentored by Bensinger. The two had worked to (unsuccessfully) organize a Nissan factory in Mississippi and she followed him to New York in 2019 to work with Workers United.

The Spot unionization efforts began acrimoniously but management became more amiable and the union ultimately prevailed. The tipping point came when Sen. Tim Kennedy called for a boycott which many Spot customers heeded.

During the Spot boycott Bensinger became a regular at the Genesee Street Starbucks across from the airport and got to know Starbucks worker Lexi Rizzo. She had been following Spot’s efforts and was adamant about trying to organize Starbucks. She eventually became an organizer.

When Spot unionized the headlines encouraged other Starbucks workers who began calling Workers United and expressing interest in forming a union of their own.

“In Spot we had an example of a good company and successful wage negotiations” Bensinger said. “Spot loomed large.""

In 2020 while on the Workers United payroll Brisack took a barista job at the Elmwood Avenue location. There she found workers empowered by Spot's unionizing move.

“Not only did I know that this was possible and have a framework of how to do it but my coworkers could believe that it was possible” Brisack said.

The movement had energized Starbucks workers who felt overworked understaffed and fed up. Morale was low across the Buffalo district and pleas to the company hadn't helped.

""We fill out these surveys that say the company cares but then nothing changes week after week"" said Will Westlake a barista at the store on Camp Road in Hamburg.

Michael Sanabria said he was ""at the end of my own rope"" before the union talks started. He had dropped down from supervisor to barista and was preparing to quit when someone invited him to an informational meeting about organizing.

""I was fed up with the direction the company was going and losing hope because calls to the company were falling on deaf ears"" he said. ""The meeting reignited my own hope.""

Combining experienced union organizers with such fired up workers was like setting a match to black powder.

""It was a tinder box"" Bensinger said.

Generation Z makes up the bulk of Starbucks organizers in Buffalo and it is known for having a progressive mindset and a tendency toward social action.

“This generation is every organizer’s dream” he said.

It also likely helped that most workers were familiar with unions and how they work. Organizers didn’t have to fight the kind of anti-union stigma they might have encountered in right-to-work states. Unions have had a strong presence in Buffalo going all the way back to Bethlehem Steel in the 1940s. It gave Workers United a foothold it might not have had elsewhere.

""When you are a union member or you live in a household with union members you generally know the benefits of union membership"" said Cathy Creighton director of Cornell University's School of Industrial Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab.

That was true for Casey Moore a worker and organizer at the Williamsville Starbucks who saw the benefits that union membership brought her dad. As a longtime private school teacher Moore said he didn't enjoy worker protections or job security.

""When he moved into public schools and started being represented by the teacher's union it made a huge difference"" she said.

Workers said they watched their parents and grandparents build nice middle-class lives buy homes and retire with pensions but have faced roadblocks trying to do the same. Many have linked their troubles to their lack of representation at work.

""That has played a major part"" said Sanabria who works at the Transit Commons Starbucks. ""I don't know anybody who can buy a house. And what's the concept of retirement? Everyone I know expects to work until they die.""

Add to that the Covid-19 pandemic. Already understaffed stores began operating on skeleton crews handling hundreds of customers a day in close quarters as the virus raged.

Meanwhile the company raked in record-breaking profits quarter after quarter. The company discontinued a $3 per hour pay bonus it had given workers to keep doors open during the pandemic after three months.

But it takes more than worker passion to fuel a successful union campaign. It takes significant resources and a union willing to use them – something not all Starbucks organizers have had in the past.

“We had the infrastructure a union that could take this on behind us” Brisack said. ”Just the sheer amount of legal battles we're having to fight and the ability to scale up to a national campaign made it imperative that we had resources to be able to do all of that.”

Starbucks has hired law firm Littler Mendelson to challenge the union in court and though Bonadonna declined to give a figure legal costs have been “significant” he said.

Starbucks workers win right to hold store-by-store unionization votes If the votes are successful as the workers predict the stores would become the first union Starbucks shops in the nation.

Workers United also won an important victory when the National Labor Relations Board decided it could hold union votes on a store-by-store basis rather than requiring the entire district to vote at once as Starbucks had requested. That meant workers could focus on winning over and retaining a few dozen workers at the first three stores as opposed to hundreds in the Buffalo Niagara market.

Still even holding onto a handful of workers is not easy in an industry with such high turnover. And companies will often delay actions in hopes that workers will quit before a vote is secured or that the movement will lose steam simply because of the transitory nature of its workers.

Starbucks pulled out all the stops – bringing dozens of corporate executives to Buffalo to persuade workers not to join the union. The company's billionaire CEO Howard Schultz came to personally appeal to workers and president Rossann Williams camped out for months.

The company transferred workers among stores in an effort the union claims to dilute support for the organizing effort. Starbucks also closed one organizing store and turned it into a training center.

But Starbucks' campaign backfired workers said. That was especially the case when Schultz told workers his decision to offer health care was similar to the generosity of Holocaust prisoners sharing tattered blankets during the war.

Former Starbucks CEO speaks to Buffalo-area workers amid union push Howard Schultz's visit comes just days before workers at three area Starbucks locations will begin voting in a union election.

""I think that was a turning point for a lot of people"" Brisack said. ""It was really the first time we'd heard from Howard directly and he was so out of touch that a lot of people became pro union listening to that.""

And for those on the verge of quitting the hope of forming a union gave workers the will to hang on Brisack said.

In the end organizers were successful and the Starbucks cafe on Elmwood Avenue became the first corporate-owned store to unionize. A flurry of union votes has followed with a total of eight unions forming at Starbucks in Buffalo and more than 200 unions succeeding around the country – even in less progressive states such as Tennessee Georgia and Missouri.

That snowball effect is exactly what companies fear and why Starbucks pulled out all the stops to block efforts in Buffalo Creighton said.

“Success is contagious. That is why companies work very hard to nip in the bud organizing efforts. Once employees see successful organizing efforts they feel empowered to try their hand at it also” she said.

Learning from Buffalo

Buffalo is still leading the charge – empowering unions in other states not just by being the first Starbucks to take the plunge and show it could be done but by holding training sessions for other Starbucks workers via zoom and sharing what they’ve learned so the movement can continue to grow.

Bensinger who founded a training institute for organizing workers has held workshops showing Buffalo workers how to train other interested organizers and handle the deluge of requests that came through for help since the union's first successful vote in December.

""We've gotten so many requests"" Bensinger said. ""And these workers are incredible."""

Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,"If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds consider T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) as a possibility. PRGFX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy) which is based on nine forecasting factors like size cost and past performance.

History of Fund/Manager

PRGFX is a part of the T. Rowe Price family of funds a company based out of Baltimore MD. Since T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund made its debut in April of 1950 PRGFX has garnered more than $27.07 billion in assets. Joseph Fath is the fund's current manager and has held that role since January of 2014.

Performance

Obviously what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 10.42% and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 7.82% which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.

When looking at a fund's performance it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years PRGFX's standard deviation comes in at 23.37% compared to the category average of 16.82%. Looking at the past 5 years the fund's standard deviation is 20.62% compared to the category average of 15.1%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.

Risk Factors

Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.1 so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark which in this case is the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years the fund has a negative alpha of -2.77. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.

Holdings

Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund the focus is primarily on equities that are traded in the United States.

As of the last filing date the mutual fund has 98.26% of its assets in stocks which have an average market capitalization of $683.48 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:

Technology Retail Trade

With turnover at about 22.7% this fund makes fewer trades than the average comparable fund.

Expenses

Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees PRGFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.63% compared to the category average of 0.99%. PRGFX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.

While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2500 investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.

Bottom Line

Overall T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund ( PRGFX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance worse downside risk and lower fees this fund looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.

The manufacturer is planning the initial public offering at the end of September or beginning of October subject to further developments in capital markets VW said Monday in a statement following a meeting of its supervisory board. Europe’s biggest carmaker is targeting to finalize the listing by the end of the year.

“This is a historic moment for Porsche” VW and Porsche Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume said. “We believe that an IPO would open a new chapter with greater independence for us as one of the world’s most successful sports-car manufacturers.”

With the share sale the billionaire Porsche and Piech clan is set to regain direct influence over what used to be its family enterprise some 13 years after they were forced to sell the sports-car business to Volkswagen. More than a decade ago Porsche Automobil Holding SE tried to take over control at the much-larger Volkswagen but the bold move failed when funding dried up during the financial crisis.

As part of the IPO VW and Porsche plan to end a so-called domination agreement that transfers profit and losses to the parent by the end of the year to be replaced with a cooperation agreement.

While more sway over Porsche is on the cards for the family VW hopes to yield funds that will help bolster its ambitious investment plans in electric models and groundbreaking new digital features. The plan is contending with some of the most challenging market conditions in years where a slowing economy rampant inflation and surging energy costs have largely brought public listings to a standstill.

Investors will be able to purchase preferred shares in Porsche that don’t carry voting rights while the family which holds a 53% voting stake in Volkswagen through its investment firm Porsche Automobil Holding is set to buy a blocking minority stake of 25% plus one share. The remaining voting stock will stay with Volkswagen.

Even as markets gyrate Porsche has lined up investor interest for its IPO at a valuation of as much as 85 billion euros ($84 billion) people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News last month. The maker of the 911 sportscar and the electric Taycan has secured pre-orders that exceed the shares on offer at a valuation between 60 billion and 85 billion euros said the people who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.

Big-name investors including T Rowe Price Group Inc. have already indicated interest in subscribing to the IPO in that valuation range the people said. On Monday VW said Qatar Investment Authority plans to buy a 4.99% stake subject to a cornerstone investment agreement. Porsche has also been gaging interest from billionaires including the founder of energy drink maker Red Bull Dietrich Mateschitz as well as LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault according to the people.

VW plans to offer Porsche’s preferred shares also to retail investors in countries including Germany Austria Switzerland France Spain and Italy the company said Monday confirming an earlier Bloomberg News story.

Many European and U.S. institutional asset managers that typically invest in major German IPOs have so far shied away from making firm commitments due to corporate governance concerns the people said. Still Porsche has enough demand to nearly fill the so-called shadow order book at the top end of the range and is oversubscribed at the lower end the people said.

The family’s heritage harks back to Wolfgang Porsche’s grandfather Ferdinand Porsche who created the VW People Car that later became the Beetle. Ferdinand Porsche’s son Ferry Porsche established the sports car operations. The first vehicle to bear the Porsche name was registered in 1948 which was the 356 “No.1” Roadster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9kbGEtcGlwZXItbW92ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtbmVnbGVjdC1vZi1jZW50cmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRpc3RyaWN0LXJlYWRlci1jb21tZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DLA Piper move continues neglect of central business district | READER COMMENTARY,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9kbGEtcGlwZXItbW92ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtbmVnbGVjdC1vZi1jZW50cmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRpc3RyaWN0LXJlYWRlci1jb21tZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711AC89D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9kbGEtcGlwZXItbW92ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtbmVnbGVjdC1vZi1jZW50cmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRpc3RyaWN0LXJlYWRlci1jb21tZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTA1L3Z3LXRvLWdvLWFoZWFkLXdpdGgtcG9yc2NoZS1pcG8tZGVmeWluZy1tYXJrZXQtZ2xvb20tbDdxNnp3cjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Porsche IPO Moves Ahead as Parent VW Looks to Defy Downturn,"Why did this happen?

The state of the Grand Theft Auto community at the moment is that they're hoping that a prospective UFO hunt in Grand Theft Auto Online originating from an Easter egg in the Definitive Edition of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas will lead to a Grand Theft Auto VI reveal in October. And inhale. With so little to go off from Take-Two Interactive you can see why this simple and sweet ""thank you"" commendation has fans in a spin.

The official pages for Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are still active of course and this ""thank you"" letter is separate to those entries. Perhaps it's years upon years of Grand Theft Auto VI speculation that's liquified our brains but could this signify an imminent announcement from Rockstar Games regarding the next entry in the series. Alternatively the developer might be reminding us of the huge global effort from its employees that created one of the greatest games in the last ten years.

Rockstar Games recently put up a new post thanking the massive army of developers specialists and staffers who worked on one of the most popular and best-selling games of all time. With nearly 170 million shipments worldwide across three console generations GTA V is less of a game and more of a kind of mini franchise in of itself; the game has generated at least $7.68 billion since 2013 and much more when the full scope of GTA Online's microtransactions are included.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

That massive success came at a heavy investment of both manpower and funding. The Rockstar Games thank you post highlights just how many people it takes to make something like GTA V. By our count more than 5000 people worked on the game. We selected all the names and copied them into Excel to see how many columns there were and Excel clocked in 6820. Headers/job titles account for a sizable portion of these columns so keep that in mind.

""Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online represent the combined efforts of our global team over many years. We want to acknowledge and thank everyone who has contributed to these games from their original launch in 2013 all the way through to present day.""

We can't imagine how many people are working on Grand Theft Auto 6 but reports indicate the game will ship with a smaller singleplayer mode at launch and expand with new campaign content over time via online updates while also running GTA Online in parallel.

Reports also say that GTA 6 will take place in Miami and feature a female protagonist for the first time in the series. There are to be two playable characters--one male and one female--in a no-holds-barred modern day Bonnie and Clyde story of crime passion and chaos.

Neither Rockstar Games nor Take-Two Interactive have announced or confirmed any details about GTA 6 other than saying that yes the game is ""well under way"" in terms of development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZW50cmFja3IuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvaW5kaWEtaXMtYS1tb2JpbGUtZmlyc3QtZ2FtaW5nLW1hcmtldC1ub3ctZGV2ZWxvcGVycy1hcmUtbG9va2luZy1hYnJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India is a mobile-first gaming market. Now developers are looking abroad,"India’s mobile gaming market is big. Not just in comparison to PC and console gaming; it is big period. PUBG Mobile’s revamped avatar Battlegrounds Mobile India had 100 million registered users in India before it was mysteriously banned last month. The pandemic breakout hit Ludo King has over 500 million downloads.

Clearly the opportunity for small-screen gaming is big in India with both Indian and foreign studios showing increased interest in penetrating a market that is ripe for a classically ad-dominated business model. But game studios operating in India are turning to a more tantalizing prospect: developing mobile games in India for a global audience.

“70% of the employees that we have work on about ten to 15 games that are primarily for the global audience” Kishore Kichili the India country head of Take Two Interactive-owned Zynga told Entrackr in an interview. Zynga has a significant presence in India and recently released two games in collaboration with the Indian government to mark the 75th year of independence celebrations.

Even so Kichili stressed Zynga’s Bengaluru office was focused on starting game development from Indian talent that could be marketed globally.

Zynga isn’t the only one. Gametion the developer behind Ludo King said in a blog post that Indians weren’t alone in helping the company break download records. The game “not only attracted more native Indian players but also gathered an expanding player base in the American and European countries” Gametion said in a May blog post. While the studio doesn’t disclose a breakdown of downloads by countries it said that the game’s surprise success took it “to places where the Ludo game wasn’t even known.”

There’s a distinction to be made here between game studios that do outsourcing work in India and those that are actually creating and ideating new games from India. For instance developers like Electronic Arts and Rockstar Studios have a significant presence in India but they generally do not work on titles that are conceived and executed by Indian teams. These teams usually do manpower-intensive and time consuming work like quality control and handling development tasks that the main teams cannot handle.

But now studios seem to be warming up to building on this presence to release original content that is for lack of a better term made in India.

At least one developer leapt at the opportunity fairly early — Super Gaming a Pune-based startup released a game that found decent success abroad before ever becoming a known name in India. MaskGun a first person shooter game that Super Gaming developed was able to garner 42 million installations most of which came from international audiences until PUBG was first banned. The game got more than 62 million downloads as of this April.

The focus abroad makes sense — while developers can gain massive reach in India most users in India don’t spend on games meaning studios are limited to ad revenue from them Zynga’s Kichili pointed out. Meanwhile he added talent in India to develop these games is in good supply.

Support from the government has also started coming in slowly — the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting set up the Animation Visual Effects Gaming and Comics (AVGC) task force in April which has been holding discussions with game developers to create Indian stories for a global audience. Kichili is a part of that task force.

“It will be in our best interest to take those [Indian] concepts and build a game for a larger stage and maybe localize that for each part of the world” Kichili said.

Britain’s new prime minister will be announced by 5 September after Conservative party members vote on the two candidates chosen by Conservative MPs.

Candidates initially needed the backing of 20 MPs to even stand in the ballot a threshold that three leadership hopefuls - Sajid Javid Grant Shapps and Rehman Chishti - failed to achieve. In the first ballot for which a candidate needed the backing of a minimum of 30 MPs Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawi were eliminated.

Candidates are whittled down by a series of voting rounds in which the last-placed candidate will be knocked out until just two are left to face the membership.



If one of the two final candidates drops out the other would become leader without a membership ballot but candidates have been asked to give assurances they will not do this.

Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) manager weeds Jason Emms said before harvest is the ideal time to stop seed-set of wild radish control late-spring germinations undertake crop-topping with registered herbicides and plan for harvest weed-seed control.

“Growers in the region have told us they are concerned about wild radish developing resistance to routinely used herbicides” Dr Emms said.

“To help prevent this growers need to deploy a mix of tactics throughout the year to prevent seed set and to minimise the chances of herbicide resistance developing.”

If left unchecked immature green plants present in high densities can interfere with harvest and mature seed can return to the seed bank creating an ongoing problem.

Weed expert John Stuchbery said now was the time growers should check for wild radish that survived herbicide applications and late-germinating plants.

“It is important to stop these seeding and topping up the seed bank” Mr Stuchbery said.

“Growers can apply a follow-up in-crop herbicide with a different mode of action if the window for herbicide has not passed.”

He said that now is also the right time to plan for crop topping or desiccating prior to harvest and for harvest weed seed control.

This research has been compiled into the Wild Radish Fact Sheet that details measures growers can take to control the weed.

University of Western Australia research agronomist Mike Ashworth works as part of the Australian Herbicide Resistance Initiative and said growers were well-positioned to get on top of wild radish.

“In Western Australia back in the 2000s many growers were not able to crop because of wild radish – but now they have it under control” Dr Ashworth said.

“It is a war that can be won with attention to detail and the biggest Achilles heel is harvest weed seed control.”

Seed generated from one year of wild radish can leave enough seed dormant to fuel eight more years of weed infestations.

Harvest weed-seed control systems such as seed destructors can intercept and pulverise up to 95 per cent of wild radish seed.

Growers who use harvest weed seed control systems including seed impact mills chaff carts and chaff decks can reduce the wild radish seed bank over time giving themselves the upper hand.

There are also herbicides registered that can be applied pre-harvest that are effective against wild radish.

Long-term planning with a focus on reducing the weed seed bank is key to successful control of wild radish.

Mayo ATU student gets career jump-start with bursary award

TWO engineering students in Atlantic Technological University (ATU) have been awarded bursaries from Galway-based firm TE Connectivity based upon their outstanding academic achievement.

Roy Sheridan a mechanical engineering student from Castlebar living in Galway and Qistina Binti Ab Halim an energy engineering student from Renmore in Galway are entering into their final year of studies within the ATU Galway-Mayo Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the Galway campus.

A key element of the bursaries awarded is each student will have to complete a major project for TE connectivity who will assign them a professional mentor to help guide the project deliverables.

After picking up their bursaries the students were given an insight into a typical engineer’s duties at a biomedical company and afterwards were given a tour of its state-of-the-art facilities.

Said Roy: “I’m honoured and delighted to be chosen for this bursary which is going to be hugely beneficial to me in my final year of my studies. It will allow me to focus and be all that I can be academically and will alleviate the financial worry associated with third level study.

“I would like to thank everyone in TE connectivity specifically Nicola and Ailish in HR for selecting and sponsoring me. It’s an honour and privilege to be chosen. I’m looking forward to working on my major project under the guidance of engineers from the company.”

Added Qistina: “I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the engineering field and joined the ATU Energy Engineering programme indirectly after completing the first year common entry course. With dedication and hard work I achieved good grades and I am delighted and humbled to be the female student chosen by TE connectivity. The bursary will reduce my financial burden and will help jump start my engineering career by allowing me to immerse myself completely into my studies.”

Added Dr. Oliver Mulryan Head of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering: “It’s a competitive workplace and getting our students to link-up and collaborate on projects with industry is win-win for everybody - the students company and engineering school.

“This is going to leave an indelible mark on the students’ learning experience during their formative years. We congratulate our students and thank TE Connectivity for continually supporting our students programmes and graduates.”

No this wasn’t my usual one-week test drive of a manufacturer’s new vehicle. Tesla didn’t provide me the bright Pearl White Model S Long Range. A private owner did.

Tesla you see is the Apple of automakers where its own early-adopter cultish clan that by scarcity word of mouth and superiority of intellect chooses its future customers. Ferrari understands.

But marketing aside the trendy Tesla was at my disposal for a couple of days in stinking hot Las Vegas where I estimate a good 10% of cars are now Teslas. Makes sense as Teslas are made just over the border in Freemont California. Plus gas prices have forever been crazy high on the West Coast and pollution is a big concern there too. So going electric holds much appeal.

It really should from a performance standpoint at least to many of us.

If muscle cars or exotics with neck-stretching acceleration are your obsession well electrics should be your new best friend. All are fast because electrics deliver instant torque via direct drive electric motors and single-speed fixed gear transmissions. No lag no waiting for a turbo to kick in. Like your electric razor or hair dryer the electrons flow instantly. Boom there it is!

I have driven other electrics so that part wasn’t new. It was the whole Tesla experience that was different. And let’s get this out of the way now. Whether you like Elon Musk or not Tesla is the top-selling electric car maker.

So how’s a Tesla drive? What are its advantages? And what are Type S’s drawbacks?

Let’s take a look and be forewarned this is not exactly like most of my test drives as it was such a short duration.

First the Type S is a sport luxury sedan in all the ways you picture one in your mind’s eye.

It’s sleek including door handles that fold into the body panels’ sides and pop out when it’s time to open a door. Oh and it’s really a hatchback as the back window and trunk open as one. That surprised me but I loved it.

Mark Savage

Power and handling are pure sports sedans. How so?

Well the dual AC electric motors one powering the front wheels one the rear create (and I’m not making this up) 825 horsepower along with 960 pound-feet of torque. Is that a lot? You bet. Consider that a new rear-engine Chevy Corvette makes 495 horsepower with 470 pound-feet of torque will do 0-60 in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 184 mph says Car and Driver. That’s a two-seat sports car but still.

The Type S gets all that power from a 100 kWh lithium-ion battery pack which due to its substantial weight also gives the Tesla a low center of gravity that makes it handle like well a sports luxury sedan. The car feels well planted handles turns with a precision you’d expect and its AWD means that even if you were running it in soggy weather or on slippery streets it’d perform with gusto and confidence.

Ride due to that weight (the car weighs more than 4500 pounds) and a long wheelbase is excellent too. Smooth and silky it’s what I’d call a Buick or Lexus ride but with a more performance-oriented stiffness to make the car feel connected to the road. I must say though that Las Vegas roads are generally so smooth that it’s not like testing a car in the frost-heave capital Wisconsin.

1 of 2 — tesla6.jpg Mark Savage 2 of 2 — tesla4.jpg Mark Savage

Safety is copiously covered. All the usual blind-spot lane-keeping and parking sensors are here and ready to beep.

Luxury? Well the car starts at roughly $96000 and most are selling for more like $105000 and there’s a waiting list that can stretch many months.

So you’d expect luxury and Tesla delivers. The body on the test car was spotless and the seams were straight and equal. So reports of poor build quality didn’t show here.

Inside the black leather seating was excellent too and the seats were well-formed. They also were heated up front but cooled would make sense for 110-degree Vegas.

Of course everyone talks about its aircraft-style yoke in Tesla’s interior that replaces the age-old steering wheel oh and a gargantuan info screen. It’s overwhelming.

Mark Savage

First that yoke. It takes some getting used to but is easy to master especially for highway driving. Where I noticed it feeling particularly odd was during parking maneuvers or turning a tight corner where one would naturally grab the top of a steering wheel to turn it sharply. Not possible here so spin that power steering yoke with your hand on one side of the yoke or a finger under one of the spokes. That maneuver reminds of early 1960s cars with over-boosted power steering that could be spun with a finger.

Ironically the steering wheel was heated totally unneeded in much of the South and Southwest.

Touchscreen? OK it’s way too much and controls virtually every function known to mankind short of rocket launching but since this is Tesla that’s likely to come.

The navigation system makes you feel like you’re looking at an entire city map so a driver will always want to pinch it to visually zoom in on where they were driving.

Also you can open garage doors call up radio stations ad nauseam use voice command to find apps ask it for directions order lunch etc. Naturally there’s a screen for setting up or observing battery charging (done through the driver’s side taillight). Ironically there is no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay here though.

And get this you engage the single-speed fixed gear automatic transmission via the screen too. Slide your finger UP along its left edge and the car moves forward. Slide your finger down the screen’s left edge and the car moves backward. Weird but I suppose one would get used to it. One also supposes this will soon be the norm for electrics.

Of course there’s a 360-degree camera that looks amazing on the screen and the Tesla stereo is a high-quality number that makes you feel you’re in a concert hall. Heck it’s so quiet in here that it feels like a symphony hall.

Overhead is a giant tinted panoramic sunroof which looks super but really needs a sun shade. Why? Well even though tinted and supposedly deflecting the sun’s rays the roof gets incredibly hot at least in Vegas. How hot? You do NOT want to touch it. It’s painful to touch.

Other interior bugaboos include an extremely wide console that feels somewhat intrusive and sounds hollow if you tap it plus shoulder belts that cannot be adjusted for driver height. That seemed particularly odd as nearly all cars crossovers and SUVs now allow the shoulder harness to be moved up or down a few inches. This one was too high for me so I crossed the left edge of my neck. Not comfy.

In the back the hatch’s cargo area is generous and easily accessed. It’s rated at 25 cubic feet and don’t forget there’s a 3.1 cu.ft. front trunk. Might wanna keep your charging cable there though.

Speaking of electricity a Tesla supercharger will give the vehicle a 200-miles boost in 15 minutes of charging. But most folks will overnight charge at home and that can take most of the night. For efficiency you’ll want a 240-volt garage charger. That ran $500 in Vegas and installation was another $600 or so varying by the electrician.

But a nearly full charge (Tesla recommends 90% to preserve battery life) will get a Type S roughly 400 miles of range plenty for a week’s commute to most downtowns and one of Tesla’s key selling points as it leads the industry in charge range.

Extras are rare. A full self-driving feature (and we’ve all heard the sad tales) costs $10000 extra while stylish Arachnid wheels add $4500. They look cool but cut your driving range by 9% according to reports.

Folks needing more power can move up to the Model S Plaid for $131900. It has three electric motors making a mere 1006 hp.

My Tesla Recharged Itself While Driving

I have a Tesla Model 3 RWD that I got just over two weeks ago. Something interesting happened during that time one day while I went up to a hike in the mountains. My car charged 6% of its battery during my drive back down the mountain.

Tesla's have a very genius feature called regenerative braking. What this means is that when your foot is not on the accelerator in a Tesla the car will slow down and put back the energy that dissipates into the battery. Essentially the kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted into energy and stored in the battery.

The electric motor makes this possible by having it function as an electric generator. Tesla's regenerative braking is so powerful that if you time it right you should hardly ever have to use your brakes to stop your car.

Two situations will cause regenerative braking: Pressing the brake pedal and releasing the accelerator pedal such as when the vehicle is coasting down a hill or when you are exiting the freeway at a high speed and simply let your foot off of the accelerator. Each of these situations creates electricity to charge the battery.

The Power of Regenerative Braking Over Gas Cars

Looking at the above image you can see that on my trip down the mountain I was getting at least 300 Wh/mile being put back into the vehicle to charge. I went from 67% to 73% during this downhill drive. 6% of my battery was recovered. Going up the hill to the mountain took a tremendous amount of energy as well.

The advantage of this over a gas car is staggering. Imagine driving a gas car up a hill. As you drive up it takes a lot more gas to get up the hill just like it takes a lot more of the battery to get up the hill.

When it comes time to drive back down the hill two things are superior for the EV that uses regenerative braking. The first is that the EV will not use the brakes while going down hill saving on brake wear and tear. The gas car will causing wear and tear.

The second is that the EV will make heavy use of regenerative braking while going down the hill. My Tesla Model 3 RWD got 6% of its battery back on my downhill drive of about 12 miles. The gas car going down hill will have to continually use its brakes to slow down and there will be no extra gas added to the car. It will simply consume energy - albeit much less while going down hill.

This is the power of regenerative braking. When used properly and properly timed I can get over 300 miles of range on my Tesla Model 3 RWD. It simply is a matter of timing and forward thinking especially when getting off the freeway going down hill or approaching a red light or stop sign. It's similar to hypermile driving in a gas car.

What do you think of Tesla's regenerative braking? Is this superior to a gas car?

App update suggests they might,"Subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on the latest Tesla news upcoming features and software updates.

Tesla app update 4.12 adds a handful of undocumented features such as displaying the number of miles driven on Autopilot if you have Tesla's Safety Score and more. Be sure to check out the complete release notes for the update.

In early 2020 Tesla added a powered trunk to its “refreshed” Model 3. The powered trunk can be opened and closed via Tesla’s mobile application as well as in the vehicle.

Since Tesla does not currently offer a powered frunk option many owners have taken it upon themselves to add one to their vehicle.

Version 4.12 of the mobile app also added tire pressure details  but it requires version 2022.24+ to be installed on your vehicle in order for it to work. Owners are now able to view the last known tire pressures directly in the app. In order to preserve battery life of the wireless pressure gauges in each wheel the tire pressure is only transmitted while the vehicle is in motion.

In this app update Tesla also removed the confirmation to open the frunk when you are in close proximity of the vehicle which could lead to accidental openings.

In contrast the trunk on a Model 3 that is not powered does not have a close animation when tapping the 'trunk' button again.

Interestingly Tesla added a close animation to the frunk indicating that powered frunks may be just around the corner. In the previous version of the app version 4.11.2  there was only an open animation. Tapping on the frunk quick action button again did not close it. However with version 4.12 tapping on the frunk button again will 'close' the frunk at least in the visualization. After a few seconds in the closed state the visualization goes back to an open frunk.

The latest Tesla update 2024.14 is full of exciting features including a fresh design an updated media player full-screen visualizations and so much more. This number of features in this update rivals holiday updates when Tesla usually releases the biggest features of the year.

Below you’ll find photos and videos of each of the major new features in this Tesla update.

High Fidelity Autopark

With update 2024.14.5 we're seeing the Park Assist Upgrade which creates 3D versions of the vehicle’s environment in real-time added to vehicles with ultrasonic sensors (USS) for the first time.

Vehicles without USS received this feature as part of the 2023 holiday update.

Parked Visualization

One of the biggest upgrades of Tesla OS v12 is the new visuals while parked. This feature is available on the Model 3 and Model Y with the AMD-powered infotainment center.

While parked the vehicle is displayed beautifully front and center while also displaying a snippet of the map in the top right corner. At the bottom of the screen you have the ‘Navigate To’ module and the media player.

New Media Player

Tesla says the new media player is also part of the visual upgrade in v12 and therefore will only be available on AMD vehicles however we think it may become available on Intel-based vehicles in the future.

The new media player makes commonly used actions easily accessible instead of having to expand the media player. Options such as shuffle repeat and search are now one tap away instead of having to expand the media player to access these features.

The new media player is a vast improvement. It now features a more obvious progress bar and a translucent background letting the vehicle visualizations shine through. For a full run-down of the new media player including its new minimized version and a video of the player in action check out our in-depth look at Tesla’s new audio player.

Full-Screen Visualization

Full-screen visualizations are no longer tied to FSD and are now available outside of North America for the time. The visualizations themselves are also improved but don’t display the full plethora of visualizations available with FSD. More vehicles are now visualized and additional features such as turn signals are now displayed.

The full-screen visualization view which is accessible by dragging the edge of the visualization to the right offers several improvements over the FSD version available in North America. The new media player and navigate to box will now always be present centered on the screen. A small view of the navigation maps is also displayed in the corner similar to the visualization while parked.

Although full-screen visualizations are available on Intel-based vehicles with FSD in North America Tesla marked this feature as AMD Ryzen-specific although that could change in the future.

Here’s a look at the updated driving visualizations that will come standard with Basic Autopilot on every Tesla after the spring update! 👀😎



Absolutely mindblowing! 🤯@tesla @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog pic.twitter.com/TMmgXdXLVG — Dominic BRNKMN (@DominicBRNKMN) May 8 2024

Audible

Tesla has added the Audible audiobook service with update 2024.14. The media player has useful buttons to skip forward and back 15 seconds as well as adjust the playback speed. Tesla is also expected to launch Amazon Music in the future.

Hands-free Trunk

A pleasant surprise in this update was the ability to open your trunk hands-free. The feature works by having you stand directly behind the vehicle for a couple of seconds the vehicle will then sound chimes as a warning before opening the trunk for you.

The feature takes advantage of the newer ultrawide band (UWB) protocol which allows for low energy and extremely high precision location tracking. With UWB Tesla can accurately tell where the person is in relation to the vehicle and how much they’re moving. The only vehicles that include ultrawide band are the redesigned versions of the Model S and Model X the new Model 3 and the Cybertruck however the feature hasn't been implemented in the Cybertruck in this update.

The video below shows how the hands-free trunk works and tests it out in a variety of cases.

Preview of Sentry Mode

Another long-awaited feature is the ability to view Sentry Mode footage from your phone. In update 2024.14 Tesla will now send you a notification whenever there is a Sentry Mode event. Attached to the notification and accessible through the app is a short video clip of the Sentry Mode event.

Trip Progress

The trip progress bar sees a nice improvement that was previously available in China. Not only can you now see a visual representation of your trip's progress but the timeline of the trip is also color-coded to show you traffic density along your trip.

This is useful to let you know about potential traffic later on on your trip. The entire module has also been refreshed to have a more modern design. Some information has been moved around such as your ETA and distance to your destination are now the two bits of information at the top of the module.

Wiper Controls

Tesla automatic wiper controls have always been problematic but Tesla is at least now giving us more intuitive wiper controls that let you easily switch the wiper speed.

After this update there are two new ways to change the wiper speed. You can press the wiper button on the left stalk or the wiper button on the new Model 3 and then use the left scroll wheel to scroll up and down to adjust the wiper speed. This was available before but previously required you to tilt the scroll wheel left and right.

You can now also tap the wiper button on the stalk multiple times to go up to the next speed.

Full-Screen Browser

A small but very useful feature that is buried in the release notes is the internet browser's new ""full screen"" button. This new feature is only available while you're parked but it gives you the ability to easily view any website full-screen. This is especially useful when streaming video in your vehicle while parked and not being limited to the choices in Tesla’s Theater app.

Tesla update 2024.14 includes the ability to make the browser full screen.

Rear Screen Updates

The rear screen is also receiving a couple of upgrades. The first is that there will now be a status bar along the top of the screen that displays the current time temperature and estimated time of arrival to your destination so that rear passengers can easily stay up to date on relevant information.

In addition to this new information Tesla will now turn off the rear screen when there is no one seated in the rear seats helping improve the vehicle's efficiency.

Improved Cybertruck Frunk

The Cybertruck is the first Tesla vehicle to receive an auto closing frunk. While it received some criticism when it was first released around potential dangers when auto closing Tesla is now addressing this issue with this update. The frunk is now a lot more sensitive to objects that may be in the way however as one video shows us you probably shouldn’t put your finger in it.

New Tesla Cybertruck update claims to make the powered frunk safer. This is 2024.14.3



Otherwise known as the spring Tesla update.



I tested this out BEFORE and AFTER the update to see if there really is a big difference.



I was actually shocked. pic.twitter.com/bfiVSY7ShI — Jeremy Judkins (@jeremyjudkins_) May 1 2024

Auto Shift

Auto Shift is getting two upgrades with this update. The first is a redesign to the feature which now makes it more compact leaving additional room for the gear indicator and the media player instead of going from top to bottom on the left side of the screen.

The Model S and Model X are also receiving improvements to the auto shifting functionality. The vehicle will now be able to shift automatically from Drive to Reverse and from Reverse to Drive in some situations instead of just auto shifting out of Park.

This feature is expected to arrive for the new Model 3 and the Cybertruck in the future as well.

Average Speed Zones UI

Average speed zones which are used to control speeds over certain periods of roads are now supported in Teslas as well. In countries where this type of speed limit is used the vehicle will keep track of your average speed and let you know when the average speed zone section started and when it will end.

New Lock Sounds for Exclusive to the Cybertruck

The Cybertruck has received nine exclusive features in this update including new lock sounds that are unique to the vehicle.

To use a lock sound instead of the standard honk when you lock your vehicle go to the Toybox and navigate to Boombox. You can also create your own custom lock sound by putting it on your USB drive. You can browse our huge list of custom lock sounds to find the perfect one.

What You Need To Know Linda Watson Guillory holds the Guinness World Record for largest collection of LCD Gaming Systems at 1599 and largest collection of playable gaming systems at 2430



The official process took about four years and cost around $1000



Linda hopes to use her knowledge of vintage video games to educate children and pique their interest in STEM learning

“I love doing things with my hands fixing games and doing things with electronics” Guillory said. “When I first started collecting I would buy broken games and try to fix them.”

In fact that’s how she fell in love with them at a young age. Guillory recalls her family buying her childhood games from thrift stores like Goodwill and the Salvation Army. She says most of the time they were broken.

“We would have to take them apart and try to fix them” she recalled. “I didn’t know at the time it was something I loved but I did. I learned to love it probably because I was doing it with my dad.”

Guillory says her collection started when she purchased a few childhood memories.

“I had one curio [cabinet] and it got full so I decided to buy a second curio to space out the games and I filled that up” Guillory said.

Guillory’s friend dubbed her a collector a title she called crazy. But once she embraced it Guillory decided she wanted to be the best.

“If I’m going to be a collector I’m going to be the best collector there is and I’m going to get everything” she insisted.

No boundary or ocean has kept Guillory from getting her hands on vintage electronic games. She’s traveled the world to find extremely rare and invaluable games.

Some of her favorites include Coleco Pacman Tandy Cosmic 200 Fire Away Soopa Doopa by Toytronic and Epoch Galaxy II.

Guillory is proud to say she’s been talking about vintage electronic games for years and during that time she has been asked if her collection was worthy of a world record. With no knowledge of a collection as big as hers she applied for the world record in 2016.

The process with Guinness World Records took around four years. Guillory says there’s two options when applying and she opted for the more affordable route. Guillory gathered her own volunteers and counters and underwent a thorough documentation process.

“I had to rent a room in a public location announce it to the public so that they could come see and observe” Guillory said.

She estimates the total process cost around $1000 which saved Guillory about $11000.

Guillory was recognized for two records: the largest collection of playable gaming systems at 2430 and the largest collection of LCD gaming systems at 1599.

Guillory is an electrical engineer in adulthood and currently works for Texas Instruments as an assembly strategy manager.

Guillory loves to talk about her world records because she hopes to impart knowledge about electronic games and keep the knowledge and love of them alive. She hopes to one day design gaming kits for kids to help pique their interest in electronics and STEM learning.

As for her collection she says she probably has more than 3000 playable systems but has no plans to update her record. At least not until someone breaks it.

“I’ll re-break the record” Guillory said with a big smile on her face.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvdGhlLWNoaXBzLWFyZS1kb3duLXJ1c3NpYS1odW50cy13ZXN0ZXJuLXBhcnRzLXRvLXJ1bi1pdHMtd2FyLW1hY2hpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The chips are down: Putin scrambles for high-tech parts as his arsenal goes up in smoke,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvdGhlLWNoaXBzLWFyZS1kb3duLXJ1c3NpYS1odW50cy13ZXN0ZXJuLXBhcnRzLXRvLXJ1bi1pdHMtd2FyLW1hY2hpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167125056C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvdGhlLWNoaXBzLWFyZS1kb3duLXJ1c3NpYS1odW50cy13ZXN0ZXJuLXBhcnRzLXRvLXJ1bi1pdHMtd2FyLW1hY2hpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2QtY2VvLzIwMjIvYXVndXN0L21lZXQtcmlzay10YWtlci1hbmQtc3Rvcnl0ZWxsZXItdGluYS15b3VuZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Risk-Taker and Storyteller Tina Young,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dmagazine.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /publications/d-ceo/2022/august/meet-risk-taker-and-storyteller-tina-young/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167125069E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2QtY2VvLzIwMjIvYXVndXN0L21lZXQtcmlzay10YWtlci1hbmQtc3Rvcnl0ZWxsZXItdGluYS15b3VuZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzA5LzA1Lzc1MG0tdXRkLWNhbXBhaWduLWFpbXMtdG8tYXR0cmFjdC10YWxlbnQtYnktYm9sc3RlcmluZy1yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtdGhlLWFydHMv0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDkvMDUvNzUwbS11dGQtY2FtcGFpZ24tYWltcy10by1hdHRyYWN0LXRhbGVudC1ieS1ib2xzdGVyaW5nLXJlc2VhcmNoLWFuZC10aGUtYXJ0cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UT Dallas campaign aims to bolster research and the arts,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzA5LzA1Lzc1MG0tdXRkLWNhbXBhaWduLWFpbXMtdG8tYXR0cmFjdC10YWxlbnQtYnktYm9sc3RlcmluZy1yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtdGhlLWFydHMv0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDkvMDUvNzUwbS11dGQtY2FtcGFpZ24tYWltcy10by1hdHRyYWN0LXRhbGVudC1ieS1ib2xzdGVyaW5nLXJlc2VhcmNoLWFuZC10aGUtYXJ0cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167125062F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzA5LzA1Lzc1MG0tdXRkLWNhbXBhaWduLWFpbXMtdG8tYXR0cmFjdC10YWxlbnQtYnktYm9sc3RlcmluZy1yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtdGhlLWFydHMv0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDkvMDUvNzUwbS11dGQtY2FtcGFpZ24tYWltcy10by1hdHRyYWN0LXRhbGVudC1ieS1ib2xzdGVyaW5nLXJlc2VhcmNoLWFuZC10aGUtYXJ0cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvdmljdG9yLWJhdHJlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9waWQ9MjAyODI1NTQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victor Batres Obituary (1949 - 2022),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvdmljdG9yLWJhdHJlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9waWQ9MjAyODI1NTQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712506C50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvdmljdG9yLWJhdHJlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9waWQ9MjAyODI1NTQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

According to Burlington County prosecutors a preliminary investigation has found that Peter Lestician's body was discovered on Friday by two men riding four-wheelers along an ATV trail in Clearfield County Pennsylvania.

PA State Police were called to an abandoned barn in Cooper Township around 4 p.m. and found his body in the front seat of a locked vehicle.

PA State Police listed Lestician's death as a suicide.

Lestician 53 was a person of interest in the death of his longtime girlfriend Sheila Maguire 54 who was found dead in her Florence home on Monday. While authorities say he was possibly the last person to see Maguire alive no charges had been filed against Lestician and prosecutors say there is no direct evidence linking him to the homicide.

Investigators say they are working with the district attorney's office in Pennsylvania to gain permission to search the vehicle and confirm the body's identity. The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office says it will continue to investigate Maguire's homicide.

An autopsy found that Maguire was killed by blunt force trauma to her head at her home on Birch Hollow Drive prosecutors say. Maguire and Lestician lived together at the home. Maguire's daughters requested police to make a wellness check at the home Monday after not hearing from their mother for several days according to prosecutors.

Previous reports said that Lestician had not been seen since last weekend. Prosecutors confirmed that he had not made contact with any family members since Aug. 26.

Maguire's social media posts say that the couple met around eight years ago when Lestician was a coach for her daughter's softball team. He led Hightstown High School to its first state title in his second year as coach and was named NJ.com's Softball Coach of the Year in 2019.

Many avid Harry Potter Asian fans who travels to the UK for leisure would have visited London as well as Watford where a dedicated tour service of the Warner Bros studio runs from Watford Junction. Located just 27km from London and functioning as a transport hub to the Midlands and northern England Watford’s location puts it at the heart of one of the most vibrant regions in Europe.

Watford is easily reached from all of London’s major international airports it is the first major stop on the West Coast Mainline from London to Birmingham Manchester and Liverpool it is located close to the intersection of the M1 and M25 motorways and it benefits from London Underground and Overground services. Its direct access of being just 15 minutes by train from London Euston station offers global business opportunities without the stress and cost of being in the capital. Watford the largest town in Hertfordshire is perfectly placed to access central London yet benefits from the breath-taking countryside on the doorstep.

The wider county offerings are plentiful with Hertfordshire’s rich history boasting more than 300 listed buildings eight Michelin-rated restaurants golf courses Cassiobury Park and the Chiltern Hills an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty meaning residents will benefit from the best of town and country living.

As London expands places like Watford are transcending commuter town status developing into a dynamic business hub. Multi-national companies such as TJX who houses TK Maxx and Homesense brands has based their European headquarters in Watford over the last 20 years with over 1600 staff alongside other major companies such as Ralph Lauren KPMG PwC Camelot Hilton Worldwide Beko and etc.

Watford which is currently undergoing significant change in the form of a GBP1.5 billion regeneration has started to attract swathes of new buyers especially post pandemic. Homes in Watford have seen strong demand from those moving out of the capital with 30% of people moving to the area originating from London. This desirable market with strong house price growth is proving to be a popular destination for young professionals to whom the mix of countryside good town center amenities and proximity to the London City also appeals.

Meeting this demand Regal London renowned for delivering exceptional high-quality homes and facilities across the capital – is launching its latest collection of apartments in the commuter hotspot exclusively with RBC in Malaysia.

The Clarendon set to be one of the tallest residential towers in Watford is an exclusive collection of new-build properties which will coincide with the £1.5 billion investment of the town’s regeneration over the next 10 years of that £10 million has already been spent in upgrading the Clarendon Road which has since completed making Clarendon Road the most welcoming statement road when one arrives in Watford.

Boasting a new premium town centre address The Clarendon will be an exquisite collection of 168 private residences comprising a mix of studio one- and two-bedroom apartments and penthouses boasting a fully inclusive premium specification. These thoughtfully designed homes will be created using a selection of high- quality materials appliances and playful colour palettes to reflect and cater for modern living.

The first of their kind in the area the apartments will feature a video entry smart panel with engineered oak flooring throughout the hallway living and dining areas and high-quality fitted carpet in the bedrooms. Kitchens will be contemporary in style featuring quartz stone worktops and fully integrated Smeg appliances whilst principal bedrooms will include fitted wardrobes offering a luxurious lifestyle for those looking to buy here.

What’s more the development will feature an impressive range of private residents’ facilities including two impressive sky gardens located on the 7th and 25th floors a state-of-the-art gymnasium cinema as well as a café 24-hour concierge service and secure underground parking. These facilities reminiscent of the world’s finest five-star hotels are unlike anything else on the Watford market. In addition up to 130000sqft of Grade A commercial space will be included as part of the wider development bringing fantastic employment opportunities to the area.

Apart from all the economic growth happening in Watford it is also renowned for its proximity to world-class education. Centred within a Golden Triangle between Oxford Cambridge and London residents are within easy access to some of the finest universities in the world including the University of Oxford University of Cambridge London School of Economics University College London King’s College London in addition to the nearby high performing primary and secondary schools.

With all that it is offering it is no wonder that Watford is seeing unprecedented demand locally as well as internationally. Prices for the apartments starts from only £325000 for a studio apartment a great entry point for Malaysian investors looking for an affordable investment backed by a solid rental market and capital gains to come.

HAYDON

Moving back into the London City demand from the more discerning investors continues to maintain sales momentum. There have been quite a few new London developments being marketed in Asia in recent times especially now that London is back into full swing but there have not been many which is as primely located as The Haydon in Aldgate.

The limited supply of new properties in the Square Mile meant an evergreen demand where international investors seek to find the best value project where they can easily find tenants who prefers to live in the City and be walking to work daily instead of doing longer commutes on the trains.

The Square Mile (London’s first CBD) is not only a global and economic business hub but its eclectic and ever-growing lifestyle offering puts it at the forefront of the capital’s social scene from Michelin-starred dining to world-renowned private members’ club including The Ned all within walking distance of the Haydon.

Residents of The Haydon will also enjoy easy access to London’s wider shopping scene from the boutiques of Old Bond Street to the independents of Old Spitalfields Market.

At the upcoming launch by RBC in Malaysia on the 10th & 11th September The Haydon will be showcased alongside The Clarendon where Malaysian investors will be able to choose which development suits their investment portfolio best.

The Haydon is a mere 2 minute’s walk from Aldgate’s Underground Station as well as the newly Elizabeth Line from Liverpool Street Station. There are a total of 7 train lines available all within the 15 minutes walk radius making it one of the most brilliantly connected development in the heart of London City. The 7 train lines includes the Circle Metropolitan District Hammersmith Central Cs2 Overground and the latest Elizabeth Line. Reaching Bond Street will only take 17 minutes and 40 minutes to Heathrow Airport.

The restaurant is located at 6677 Manlius Center Road in East Syracuse between the Tractor Supply store and the DeWitt Home Design Center.

“We hope to be here for years to come” said Enio Agüero who runs Mi Rancho with his wife Mirna. “For that our goal is to make an impact and make it a fun place and a family place.”

In response to someone who informed the Kirkville couple that the business was the seventh to occupy that space in their recent memory Enio said he told them that seven is a lucky number.

The Mi Rancho menu includes burritos carnitas fajitas nachos and hot tamales among other meals.

Enio said that although he and his wife are not the first to bring Mexican cuisine to the village they are excited to introduce their own uniquely flavored dishes to that side of town.

“We don’t see it as a competition with anybody else” he said. “It’s just another way to provide a good place to eat.”

Mirna said it had been stressful and time-consuming to ready the restaurant but worthwhile.

Calling the opportunity to open “a dream come true” regardless of the hard work that comes with it Enio said he wants the business to generate connections with new friends who can share in its anticipated success.

The couple expressed gratitude at the Sept. 1 grand opening for the divine influence in their lives and the people who encouraged their idea to start a restaurant even if was just the simple wish of “good luck.”

“Whatever God gives us we have to be responsible for” said Enio a chaplain with the Air National Guard sector based in Rome New York. “If we stay by God’s side we will succeed.”

At the event Enio led those gathered in a dedicatory prayer spoken in both English and Spanish. He asked for the restaurant to prosper and become a place of gathering for the community.

“As we say in Spanish mi casa es su casa—my house is your house” he said to the attendees before inviting them back inside. “Make it your house.”

On behalf of the East Syracuse Village Board Mayor Lorene Dadey handed a written-out welcome message to the Agüeros during the ceremony.

“We are very grateful and thankful that you have come here” Dadey said. “You have a beautiful place.”

""Gustavo will be remembered by all he worked with for his leadership talent and stewardship of our Company. I am proud to have been his colleague and he will be truly missed by all of us at Bed Bath & Beyond and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him” said Harriet Edelman independent chair of the company's board in Sunday's statement.

Bed Bath & Beyond has faced turbulence recently: Its shares made a monstrous run from $5.77 to $23.08 over a little more than two weeks in August in trading reminiscent of last year’s meme-stock craze when out-of-favor companies suddenly became darlings of smaller-pocketed investors.

On Wednesday the company said it would shutter stores and lay off workers in a bid to turn around its beleaguered business.

The home goods retailer based in Union said it will close about 150 of its namesake stores and slash its workforce by 20%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1ZmZvbGtnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9mMS1jb21lcy10by1ub3Jmb2xrLWxvY2Fscy1sb3Zpbmctc3BvcnRzLXRyYWN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F1 comes to Norfolk locals loving Sports Tractors,"History will be made in Norfolk as the city gets ready to host their first ever Formula 1 speed racing competition with Sports Tractors

Or follow us on Google News

Did you know there’s a silent war going on inside your home? Alternating current (AC) electricity comes in from the grid but many of your appliances and lighting run on direct current (DC). Every time you plug in a TV computer or cell phone charger power must be individually converted from AC to DC — a costly and inefficient process. Purdue University researchers have proposed a solution to the problem by retrofitting an entire house to run on its own efficient DC-powered nano-grid.

The project to transform a 1920s-era West Lafayette home into the DC Nanogrid House began in 2017 under the direction of Eckhard Groll the William E. and Florence E. Perry Head of Mechanical Engineering and member of Purdue’s Center for High Performance Buildings. “We wanted to take a normal house and completely retrofit it with DC appliances and DC architecture” Groll said. “To my knowledge no other existing project has pursued an experimental demonstration of energy consumption improvements using DC power in a residential setting as extensively as we have.”

The first years were spent renovating and upgrading the infrastructure and adding energy improvement measures like insulation and new windows. Rectify Solar provided a full installation of solar panels on the roof while industry partners supplied new appliances and HVAC systems.

Then came the hard part.

“Large-scale distribution of DC power through a house in the 21st century is really uncharted territory” said Jonathan Ore a 2020 Purdue Ph.D. graduate who served as the lead researcher on the project. “You can’t just go to the hardware store and buy DC circuit breakers or other critical distribution systems. We had to create this infrastructure from scratch.”

Purdue researchers in collaboration with Rectify Solar developed a patented distribution system that enables the house to integrate both DC power — from solar panels wind turbines or battery storage — and AC power from local electrical utilities. The system is also modular so it can grow and adapt for different sizes of homes and businesses integrating multiple sources of electricity.

“The creation of the 380-volt DC load center was definitely a challenging and rewarding experience” said Phil Teague co-founder and CEO of Rectify LLC. “We used biomimicry and the neural connections of the brain as our inspiration and added smart technologies and control mechanisms. Transitioning to DC can simplify homes buildings and the grid as a whole. This project helped me realize that DC is not only the future it always was.”

Why DC power?

AC has been the dominant infrastructure in the world’s electrical grids since the late 1800s when the “war of the currents” saw Thomas Edison’s dream of a DC-based electrical infrastructure lose out to George Westinghouse’s AC system. But while the “war” may seem to be over two recent developments have prompted researchers to re-investigate DC’s benefits. The first is the increasing availability of renewable energy sources — solar panels and wind turbines — as well as energy storage in large home-based battery packs. These devices are all naturally DC so to have a DC-based home infrastructure enables this energy to be delivered with almost no waste or inefficiency.

The second development is a series of extreme weather events which have exposed the fragility of the U.S. electrical grid. Winter snowstorms in Texas as well as extreme heat in the southwest have caused brownouts and blackouts to become increasingly common.

“The United States grid is like one of those marble-balancing games where you tilt the table to keep the marbles from falling off. However tilting in one direction to save one marble can cause the rest to come crashing down” Ore said. “When too many homes suddenly start requesting extra power for heating or air-conditioning the grid can become severely unbalanced while trying to respond.

“A DC-house can potentially sustain itself for short periods of time by generating its own renewable energy and detaching from the grid through the help of on-site stored energy. This ultimately minimizes the strain on the outside grid in emergency situations. Events like the Texas storm are perfect illustrations of how a DC-house can benefit individuals and the community.”

A living laboratory

Purdue’s DC Nanogrid House is a “living laboratory.” Graduate students live in the home full time to offer real-world feedback on its comfort and usability. They’ve installed sensors in every room to detect whether people are present so that the HVAC system only conditions air where it’s needed.

“This gives us the opportunity to perform both cutting-edge research on energy-saving opportunities and observe its potential benefits in a truly real-world setting rather than just relying on simulations” Groll said.

This is the second living laboratory Groll has established near Purdue’s campus following the lead of his ReNEWW House which explores technologies for net-zero energy water and waste.

Emerson provided the control software and system. “The next-generation energy solutions that will drive the future of sustainability are unsurprisingly being envisioned and made real by the next generation of innovators” said Bob Yeager president of Emerson’s power and water business. “We are proud of the role our Ovation software and integrated automation technologies play in making student innovators’ visions a reality and excited to see how a new generation of thinkers will leverage our digital foundation to maintain grid stability and create more resilient sustainable communities.”

Other industry partners on the DC Nanogrid House include Carrier Corp. Duke Energy Southern California Edison Rheem Manufacturing Trane Technologies Whirlpool Corp. Ingersoll Rand Daikin Global Marshall DC Lighting and Regal Rexnord Corp.

“It’s been really amazing to see the interest in this” Ore said. “We started this project as just a proof of concept. But as our country experiences more and more issues with the grid companies are actively seeking to integrate our work. People are interested in it from every aspect: from the electrical side from the thermal side from the automation and management side. This is a perfect testbed to experiment with those technologies.”

Purdue innovators have worked with the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization to patent this technology. The researchers are looking for partners to continue developing their technology.

The Mets now lead the Atlanta Braves by just one game in the National League East.

Atlanta Braves' fans who stuck around during the team's rain delay Sunday at Truist Park were ecstatic when they found out that their divisional foe the New York Mets lost 7-1 to the National League-worst Washington Nationals.

Upon the completion of the Mets' loss the Atlanta Braves' DJ played 'Narco' by Timmy Trumpet and Blasterjaxx over the loud speakers at Truist Park.

'Narco' has become synonymous with Mets' closer Edwin Diaz who runs out to the song whenever he enters a game. The song has quickly become one of the most iconic reliever entrances in baseball history.

Last week the song's artist Timmy Trumpet played the song live as Diaz entered the game in the Mets' win over the Dodgers at Citi Field.

The Braves' DJ trolled the Mets following their loss which is on-brand for Truist Park employees.

In Bryce Harper's final year of his contract with the Washington Nationals in 2018 the Braves' organist played Steve Goodman's 'Go Cubs Go' as Harper walked up to the plate amid rumors that Harper would leave the Nationals as a free agent to sign with the Cubs.

With the Mets losing two of three at home to the lowly Nationals and the Braves sweeping the Miami Marlins the Braves are now just one game back of the Mets' lead in the National League East with four and a half weeks remaining in the regular season.

The Mets have not spent a single day out of first place since April 11. Entering play June 2 the Mets had a 10.5 game-lead over the division's next closest team: the Atlanta Braves.

It was the highest scoring performance for the Raiders since 2018 and their head coach is all smiles about the direction of the program.

“I’m fired up. First win of the season…I was really proud” said McGuire during the post-game press conference.

He went on to list a number of young players that stepped up under the bright lights in Lubbock such as receivers Loic Fouonji and Jerand Bradley who hauled in two touchdown receptions apiece.

There were a ton of good things going on offensively for Tech but the lone downturn was a devastating moment. Senior quarterback Tyler Shough left the game early in the first half only to return in a sling leaving many to speculate that he’d re-injured his non-throwing collarbone.

It would be the same injury that sidelined him last season and would be a heartbreaking blow to both Shough and this Raiders team.

With most of the game left to play it was sophomore quarterback Donovan Smith’s time to take over and he delivered in style.

Smith lit up the Racers going 14-for-16 with 221 yards and 4 touchdowns through the air. After losing the position battle to Shough just days prior to the game Smith remained focused and McGuire applauded his young field general for how he performed under the pressure.

“One of our big deals as a team is ‘What’s next?’. It’s everything in life” said McGuire. “Good things are going to happen ‘what’s next?’. Bad things are going to happen ‘what’s next?’. And I think it shows a lot about (Smith's) character…I was really proud of that.”

Smith was surgical in the victory over Murray State. Picking their defense apart on every pass play for a nearly perfect rating.

He’ll likely be the Raiders starter for at least the next several weeks and McGuire believes that his ball club is in good hands.

“He was ready to play at an extremely high level…(Smith’s) ready to run this team whenever it’s his opportunity” McGuire added.

On the other side of the ball the Red Raiders were dominant especially up front. Texas Tech overpowered the Murray St. offensive line at every turn finishing the night with 13 tackles for loss and four sacks.

That’s a huge improvement for a team that only averaged five tackles for loss per game last season even if it is against an FCS opponent. Junior defensive lineman Philip Blidi made the biggest individual impact recording two sacks and three tackles for loss.

“I'm proud of the defense. We played a lot of guys on defense” noted McGuire also mentioning that “We’ll add to the depth of that defensive front that front seven. We’ll just keep getting better.”

Their opponents will also be getting better as the season goes along. The Raiders will face 24th-ranked Houston who just came off a two-point win over UTSA in an overtime nail-biter.

Alabama the Murray State Racers were not but Tech did what they were supposed to do and moved seamlessly into a new starting quarterback at the drop of a hat.

The Red Raiders will have their work cut out for them going forward but that’s the reason McGuire’s here.

“That’s the number one thing at the end of the day…when that ball gets kicked off all we care about is winning.”

McGuire said after Saturday's game the team medical staff could not determine after an initial medical evaluation and X-ray the extent of the injury and that it could be related to the collarbone or the acromioclavicular (AC) joint.

""It is more of his collarbone"" McGuire said during his weekly Monday press conference ""but it's right there wherever you talk about the collarbone and the AC joint kind of fit together. I'm hoping that it's less than six (weeks) but I would probably say it's anywhere between three and six weeks to get him back.""

Shough is scheduled to see Dr. Kevin Crawford a team physician and orthopedic surgeon on Wednesday.

Asked if surgery is possible McGuire said ""Possibly and that's where (recovery) could prolong to six weeks if it is.""

Tech has an open date after the sixth game so the Red Raiders don't start the second half of their schedule until Oct. 22.

Shough tackled at the end of a 17-yard run in the first quarter landed on his left shoulder the same one in which he suffered a season-ending broken collarbone in last year's Big 12 opener at Texas.

McGuire said Monday ""It looks like more of his collarbone. It's not exactly where it was last year and last year they didn't do anything other than let it heal.""

McGuire was hesitant to go into detail about the specifics of the injury.

""I'm not going to put any of our guys in a situation where they'll be targeted whenever they do come back"" he said. ""I know no coach in America is ever going to say that they are but it's our job to hit quarterbacks. We're going to try to hit quarterbacks and they're going to try to hit our quarterbacks. So I want to make sure I'm kind of protecting those guys.""

Shough's unavailability means sophomore Donovan Smith regains the starting job he had for the last four games of the 2021 season when he led Tech to upset victories against Iowa State and Mississippi State earning the Liberty Bowl most valuable player award in the latter.

Smith played six series after he entered Saturday's game completing 14 of 16 passes for 221 yards and four touchdowns. Offensive coordinator Zach Kittley said Smith did not take a snap with the first team during last week's practices which is his normal approach with a No. 2 quarterback. Smith and Behren Morton split the snaps with the second team and he said there were plenty to go around.

""Every single play we called in the game Donovan had had multiple reps at those"" Kittley said. ""Now they may not have been with him taking the snap from (starting center) Dennis (Wilburn) but he's still getting those reps and still understanding the progressions and the run boxes and all those things.""

The similarities among Tech's top three quarterbacks makes the switch from Shough to Smith less complicated.

""We're not going to change schematically what we do"" Kittley said. ""We've kind of tailored those guys to be prepared for their opportunity and we've been telling them all ... 'Y'all are one snap away so you've got to be prepared.' Unfortunately it happened and Donovan was unbelievable and very poised and ready for the moment and came in and just balled out. So we won't change what we're doing.""

The Tech staff remains committed to using Morton as well. The redshirt freshman completed 7 of 10 for 97 yards and a touchdown Saturday when he entered in a 56-10 game and played the last seven series.

""It's not going to be a rotation deal"" McGuire said ""but I truly believe smart coaches — and I'm not saying I am; Zach Kittley is — but smart coaches get their playmakers on the field. It's weird that quarterback is the only position that everybody thinks there should only be one playing whenever those guys are usually some of your best athletes. They're definitely some of our best athletes. I think they proved it on Saturday and we're going to continue that way.""

Also on Monday McGuire said offensive lineman Cole Spencer will sit out the season and be eligible to apply for a medical hardship waiver that would allow him to play in 2023. Spencer had knee surgery after last season and in addition to rehabilitating from that he also has experienced lower back problems McGuire said.

Among the many transfers who joined Tech in the off-season Spencer was the most highly anticipated given that he made 44 career starts at Western Kentucky and played last season for Kittley and offensive line coach Stephen Hamby who were subsequently hired by Tech.

McGuire said this summer he projected Spencer to start at left guard.

""I hate that for him"" Kittley said. ""Love him to death. He came with us. Unbelievable guy. Hate it for him but if you know Cole he'll be back better than ever and we're looking forward to having him back next year.""

Conference USA coaches voted Spencer first-team all-Conference USA in 2021 and Pro Football Focus gave Spencer the highest pass-blocking grade in the conference.

In an effort to close the racial homeownership gap the Community Affordable Loan Solution will launch in markets with predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods including Charlotte Dallas Detroit Los Angeles and Miami and may later expand to other cities. It will not require a minimum credit score and will instead consider other factors for eligibility.

Is Bank of America's new zero-down mortgage worth it?

Home buying is a notoriously expensive process and has gotten even more costly as property values have increased over the years. When you consider a modest 5% down payment lender fees which can run you up to 1% of the home's value and closing costs which can be as high as 6% of the loan's value buyers can pay close to $46800 upfront for a $400000 home — this still excludes other charges like the underwriting fee title check home inspection and appraisal fees. Offering a loan that doesn't require a down payment mortgage insurance or closing costs could lower the barrier to entry for homeownership. And when you spend less money on down payment and closing costs you can reserve more of your savings for paying for serious home repairs that need to be taken care of or emergency expenses that could arise as soon as you move in. Just keep in mind though that making no down payment means that your home loan will cover the entire value of the property and your monthly payments can be higher than they'd be if you paid a little upfront. You'll need to work with a financial planner or mortgage lender to make sure that the monthly payments will fit into your budget.

Who will be eligible?

While the goal of the program is to bring Black and Hispanic borrowers closer to homeownership people of all races can qualify for the Community Affordable Loan Solution. Eligibility will be based on income and the location of the property. It will also use credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent utility bill phone and auto insurance payments to determine creditworthiness though there is no minimum credit score requirement. If you're interested in applying for a loan through this program you must also complete a homebuyer certification course provided by select Bank of America and HUD-approved housing counseling partners before submitting your loan application. ""Our community affordable loan solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve"" AJ Barkley head of neighborhood and community lending at Bank of America said in a statement.

How do you cash in savings bonds?

A Sacramento viewer tried to cash in his savings bond but learned it would be some time before he could get his money. Why?

""You know we've been buying bonds since 1985"" said.

The paper savings bond is now extinct. The government switched to an electronic version in 2011. But when Dan Hood tried to cash in his older matured bonds in February his bank wouldn't accept them. So that got us wondering what is the best way to cash in older savings bonds?

According to the treasury department your local bank is the best option to instantly get your money. But after an uptick in fraud some banks quit accepting them meaning you must send them in directly to the treasury department and that could take a few months to cash.

Dan mailed his in -- $1500 worth. Two months later he had his money.

""Our thought was that a savings bond should be more liquid than that"" he said. They're not liquid at all.""

If you have old bonds it may take some time to get the money. And if these bonds are worth more than $1000 you have to do more work.

ETFE is a type of tensile membrane — synthetic weather-resistant material stretched over an open span — that is increasingly being used on all parts of stadiums most notably as a more cost-effective replacement for domes or retractable roofs. Awareness of ETFE has grown significantly in recent years thanks to its use on the roofs or canopies of U.S. Bank Stadium SoFi Stadium and Allegiant Stadium. And at least one of the teams building a new stadium the Tennessee Titans is planning to enclose their proposed new stadium with an ETFE covering to enable year-round events including basketball.

These days “if a building is going to have a roof on it in some way it’s going to have ETFE on it somehow” said Dan Wacker Mortenson director of preconstruction.

Innovation around man-made polymers like ETFE and its cousin PTFE (full name: polytetrafluoroethylene also known by the brand name Teflon) has gone on full blast for over a century but creative designers and engineers are just beginning to cook up their own custom formulas for use in sports venues too.

“It’s like a platform that you can innovate on” said Phil Kolbo Populous principal and senior architect. “You’re not pulling things off the shelf anymore; you’re making what you need.”

Tensile membranes are lighter — and cheaper — than steel allow controlled natural light into otherwise dim indoor stadiums and have an open-ended potential for use in all parts of a building — not just roofs but in place of glass windows or as coverings over premium areas or seating bowls. The latter concept could also work in a place like Buffalo which doesn’t want to surrender its late season home-field weather advantage and has already committed to an outdoor stadium but could keep direct snowfall off its fans with a tensile canopy system encompassing the field.

“When you talk about the fan experience on open-air facilities traditionally NFL stadiums haven’t had canopy coverage” said Wacker. “But Europe is full of these PTFE roofs that shade the fans MLS is going for 100% coverage of its fans and I think the NFL would look at teams using that as an option.”

Freedom of form

Tensile systems can be stretched over two sides of anything: a backyard a premium bar in a stadium or a sports venue’s roof. The flexibility of tensile materials allows designers to incorporate complex curves and shaping that would be impossible or at least very costly with traditional steel and metal panel roofs according to David Peragallo sales and specification manager Americas at French firm Serge Ferrari Group.

“[Tensile fabrics] give architects and designers of sports stadiums a unique freedom of form and flexibility to take their design to the next level” Peragallo wrote in an email to Sports Business Journal.

TFE materials are highly resistant to heat and sunlight abuse are hydrophobic and have a low coefficient of friction meaning they’re easy to clean because nothing sticks to them. ETFE is thinner than PTFE allows natural light into a space and is better for fully enclosing and conditioning a building; PTFE is more effective for shading structures like canopies because it’s a mesh and not as transparent.

Tensile materials like ETFE are lighter than traditional roofs and need less support. That’s critical for stadium project budgets because the longspan steel propping up a roof can run 600 to 800 feet in length and is the most expensive part of the stadium according to Wacker. The cost of a fully steel-supported roof especially if it mechanically retracts is the reason so many NFL stadiums don’t have them.

U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis was one of the first major venues in the U.S. to have an ETFE roof in 2016. The Vikings wanted a retractable roof but Kevin Taylor principal and sector manager venues for architecture firm HKS said that the ETFE alternative gave the Vikings “retractability” without the price of a retractable roof saving roughly $100 million.

“We spent a lot of time making sure we could get a lot of natural light coming into that facility” said Taylor who was the lead designer on AT&T Stadium U.S. Bank Stadium and SoFi Stadium. “Once we did it on the Vikings I knew it was going to happen on other projects.”

ETFE and related materials are also lighter than glass making them practical for vertical use like on the concourse at Globe Life Field in Arlington or AT&T Stadium across the street where they ultimately settled on PTFE.

Let’s make it

Where U.S. Bank Stadium is fully enclosed SoFi Stadium is a canopied venue like a stadium perched beneath a single-layer ETFE “carport” held in place by extensive cabling. U.S. Bank Stadium’s roof entailed a three-layer pillow system (the sheets of ETFE are inflated) whose ambient heat helps melt snow off the roof in the winter.

Allegiant Stadium also used a pillow system which is critical for keeping out ultraviolet and infrared light and enabling the venue to meet building code. That’s one of the challenges of working with ETFE said Kolbo. But frit a pattern or ink imprinted on a material can also help deter UV or infrared that would otherwise pass through ETFE. And new products are already coming to market that possess low-e coatings to block infrared rays just like a much heavier pane of glass could.

Future versions of ETFE will likely incorporate (not just house) LED and collect solar energy. Those enhancements will be made in the lab but designers are already expanding the tensile fabric palette for sports venues like at Allianz Field where Populous and Kolbo worked with engineers from Walter P Moore Geiger and Pfeifer to create a custom type of PTFE material specifically for the 93540-square-foot façade wrapped around Minnesota United’s stadium.

“We didn’t go ‘oh that’s a cool material let’s use that’” said Kolbo. “We said ‘hey this is what we want to do. We want reflection we want lamination we want to see through it. These are the things that we want; let’s make it.’”

The owner of ScullyWest Properties is renovating an iconic downtown bank building to its former glory keeping faith with the way noted Bozeman architect Fred Willson designed the structure when it opened a century ago.

The once and future home to US Bank at the corner of Main and Black streets is currently covered in scaffolding as a cadre of carpenters masons and other tradespeople work to eliminate any evidence of a 1972 renovation that obscured brick and limestone walls arch windows and a cornice around the top of the five-story structure.

“We get a lot of people complimenting our contractors on what they’re doing here and it’s great to see. I knew going in that we were going to bring back a great piece of history and I felt very confident that the people of Bozeman would be really excited about this.” Building owner Randy Scully

“It’s too precious of a building not to do what we can to bring it back” Scully said on a recent sunny summer morning as the sounds of power tools filled the air. “I know a lot of people are very excited.”

He said people stop on Main Street and take photographs of the work. Some sit on a bench on Black Street and look up and marvel.

“We get a lot of people complimenting our contractors on what they’re doing here and it’s great to see. I knew going in that we were going to bring back a great piece of history and I felt very confident that the people of Bozeman would be really excited about this.”

Designed by Willson renowned throughout Bozeman and Montana for projects like the Ellen Theater the Gallatin County Courthouse and others the bank was built in a Classical Revival style when it opened in 1920 featuring a grand entrance and large windows. But it was remodeled in a contemporary style a half-century later obscuring many of the charming features of the original building and reflecting a more modern style at the time.

“The ’70s came and they ruined the whole thing” said Julia Strehlau Jacobs program assistant with the Extreme History Project who gives walking tours of historic Main Street. “That renovation basically ruined any chance for it to be on the National Register” of historic sites. “I really don’t know where these people were coming from.”

Jacobs gushed with praise for the efforts of Scully and his team.

“To see something on Main Street that is being put back to its original historic beauty is kind of amazing” she said. “We as historians are so thankful for that. You know the wild west Main Streets are kind of unique and to not have them gone totally is very very valuable.”

The building started as the Commercial National Bank later became First National Bank and is currently a US Bank facility. US Bank is currently occupying space to the east of the structure that’s now under renovation and will return when the work is completed. Scully says he is hoping to finish the project by early 2024.

“We are very proud of our history in Bozeman and look forward to continuing to serve the community” said US Bank spokesperson Jeff Shelman. “We look forward to the possibilities that this redevelopment will provide for the community.”

Bozeman City Commissioner Terry Cunningham said the renovation is “like watching linoleum being peeled back to reveal beautifully aged hardwoods. Randy Scully’s painstaking restoration is a gift to the community.”

“To see something on Main Street that is being put back to its original historic beauty is kind of amazing. We as historians are so thankful for that. You know the wild west Main Streets are kind of unique and to not have them gone totally is very very valuable.” Julia Strehlau Jacobs program assistant with The Extreme History Project

Cunningham added that such projects “illustrate the value of preservation from a historic and aesthetic standpoint.”

Willson spoke of his architecture philosophy in an address at Montana State University in 1954: “There is a fundamental reason for every feature embodied in a structure. It must have refinement simplicity beauty and good taste. Thus an architect’s business is to make the things of daily life beautiful.”

Scully declined to discuss details of how much he paid for the building or what the renovation is costing other than to concede that “These projects are by no means inexpensive.”

His plans include a grand two-story atrium entrance which will be occupied by US Bank. Offices and other facilities will fill the remaining part of the structure. He shot down rumors that any part of the building would include apartments.

He is replacing the staircases and putting in a new elevator that will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

He noted that when Willson designed the building the floor structure was unique to Bozeman and was similar to the way the Empire State Building and other skyscrapers were built. “They designed these buildings to withstand fires” he said adding that there is no evidence of any fire damage in the century-old structure.

When it opened the building was the tallest structure in Bozeman.

“This one is all steel with a brick skeleton” Scully said. “Our masons keep commenting on what great shape it is in.”

The renovation will also include an expansion in the rear of the building bringing the 33000-square-feet structure to 42000 square feet.

The building will be named “The National” to reflect its history as a national bank.

“It’s important for a historical piece of Bozeman to capture the name of the building” Scully said. “Tenants will come and go but we want buildings to last and this one will last for a long long time and we want to have that name stay with the building.”

Scully 53 said he has been swinging a hammer since he was 16 and the project is a pinnacle of his career. He said he and his partners have been discussing for several years a renovation of the building purchased from US Bank in 2020. Work began last February after the last remaining tenants were relocated.

“I’m restoring an iconic building in downtown. This is one of the gems of downtown Bozeman” he said. “I just don’t have it in me to see this building be anything other than renovated. It’s a gem. You can’t get rid of a gem like this.”

With guests cutting back on visits Wingstop's new CEO explains his playbook for boosting sales.

One move is ending an exclusive delivery partnership with DoorDash and adding Uber Eats.

Last week Wingstop also entered the chicken sandwich wars years after competitors.

Wingstop was among several tech-savvy restaurant chains that became a pandemic winner logging more than $1 billion in digital sales in 2020.

But as consumers deal with record inflation this year many are cutting back on restaurant visits. That's hurting chains like Wingstop which installed a new chief executive Michael Skipworth in March. In its last earnings call in late July the company said customer visits are down.

In an interview last week with Insider Skipworth said he's betting on three plays to reverse that trend – entering the chicken sandwich wars introducing bundled meal deals and adding Uber Eats as a new delivery partner. That latter is a significant move as DoorDash has been the chain's exclusive delivery partner for years.

""We have a proven playbook"" said Skipworth who was previously Wingstop's chief operating officer and finance chief.

Skipworth explains his three-pronged approach to increasing sales at Wingstop which operates more than 1800 restaurants worldwide. The majority of Wingstop stores are franchised locations in the US.

Now is the right time to enter the chicken sandwich wars

Three years ago Popeyes introduced a spicy chicken sandwich that broke the internet and launched a war with Chick-fil-A. Other national fast food chains introduced their versions of chicken sandwiches over the course of a year including Wendy's Sonic and KFC.

Even Taco Bell wanted a piece of the action launching a chicken sandwich taco in Tennessee and North Carolina in early 2021.

Wingstop didn't move on a chicken sandwich at the time because ""we didn't need it"" Skipworth said.

Until now.

Last week the chain rolled out 12 chicken sandwiches offering the same flavors as their wings.

Skipworth said the company rarely adds new items to its menu. Last year it introduced the delivery-only brand Thighstop a supply chain hack created to save the brand from soaring chicken wing prices. Before that he said the previous new menu item the company launched was more than a decade ago when it introduced boneless wings.

Skipworth said he expects the chicken sandwich to bring ""meaningful growth"" to the brand because price-conscious consumers will be excited about the value of the new menu item.







""We felt now is the right time for a chicken sandwich. We were able to leverage our size and scale and negotiate really good pricing with our strategic supplier partners"" Skipworth said.

The a la carte price of Wingstop's chicken sandwich is $5.49. By comparison spicy chicken sandwiches cost $5.29 at Chick-fil-A and $4.49 at Popeyes. The crispy chicken sandwich at Shake Shack cost $7.79 according to prices found at those restaurants in Southern California.

Wingstop expects to reach more delivery consumers with Uber Eats and DoorDash

DoorDash introduced its white-label delivery platform DoorDash Drive in 2016. Fast-casual chains Wingstop and Chipotle were early adopters of the program.

DoorDash delivers orders made through Wingstop's app or website for a fee.

Skipworth said that Wingstop had used DoorDash as an exclusive delivery partner since at least 2017. He described the nation's top delivery provider as ""an incredible partner for us.""

But with the ""challenging backdrop in 2022"" Skipworth said this summer was ""a good opportunity"" to look at adding another delivery operator.

Wingstop chose Uber Eats because like DoorDash it has been ""really smart about building loyalty"" to its platform through subscription services that reach millions of consumers. DoorDash's DashPass for example has over 10 million members globally.

""We knew there was this consumer base out there that we weren't serving today"" Skipworth said of Uber Eats. ""And we felt this was the right time to pull that lever in and again bring more guests into Wingstop through the Uber platform.""

While there's some overlap between consumers who use DoorDash and Uber Eats Skipworth said the data shows that both delivery apps serve ""two distinct consumer groups.""

He said he doesn't expect a ""meaningful impact to our existing DoorDash business.""

""While it's only a couple of weeks into the Uber Eats national launch and without any advertising support we are encouraged by the early results"" Skipworth told investors during a conference call in July.

By adding Uber Eats Wingstop joins a fray of chains that have been breaking away from exclusive delivery partnerships to boost delivery sales. McDonald's dropped Uber Eats as an exclusive partner in 2019. During the pandemic Chipotle added Uber Eats as a delivery partner after working with Postmates and DoorDash.

Wingstop is leaning into value deals thanks to wing deflation

Wingstop developed the virtual brand Thighstop last year to save money on soaring chicken wing prices which reached $3.25 a pound in 2021.

By creating a thigh-focused menu a part of the bird the company never used Wingstop saved money by buying whole chickens from suppliers. A year later the price per pound is now $1.15 as demand for chicken wings cools causing excess inventory and deflation the CEO said.

That is allowing Wingstop to ""lean into"" adding value deals to the menu Skipworth said. One example that is driving traffic is the recently introduced Boneless Meal Deal. The $15.99 value meal includes 20 boneless wings and a large fry.

""We saw a marked improvement in the sales trends during the quarter"" Skipworth said.

In 2021 Wingstop recorded its 18th consecutive year of same-store sales growth a vital indicator of a company's financial health. By adding Uber Eats leaning into value and introducing chicken sandwiches Skipworth said he's got a playbook that ""sets the stage for 19 consecutive years of same-store sales growth.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3ViZXItZHJpdmVycy1zZWNyZXRzLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Secrets From Former Uber Drivers — Best Life,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3ViZXItZHJpdmVycy1zZWNyZXRzLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710BBC2B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3ViZXItZHJpdmVycy1zZWNyZXRzLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b25oZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvaGVhZGluZy10by1naWxsZXR0ZS1zdGFkaXVtLWZvci1hLXBhdHJpb3RzLWdhbWUtdGhpcy1zZWFzb24tdGhlc2UtYXJlLXRoZS1iZXN0LXdheXMtdG8tZ2V0LXRoZXJlL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b25oZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvaGVhZGluZy10by1naWxsZXR0ZS1zdGFkaXVtLWZvci1hLXBhdHJpb3RzLWdhbWUtdGhpcy1zZWFzb24tdGhlc2UtYXJlLXRoZS1iZXN0LXdheXMtdG8tZ2V0LXRoZXJlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heading to Gillette Stadium for a Patriots game this season?

The healthcare giant announced Monday that it will acquire Signify in a deal valued at $8 billion or $30.50 per share in cash. The deal is subject to approval from Signify Health's shareholders and the companies expect that it will close in the first half of 2023.

""Signify Health will play a critical role in advancing our healthcare services strategy and gives us a platform to accelerate our growth in value-based care"" said CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch in a press release. ""This acquisition will enhance our connection to consumers in the home and enables providers to better address patient needs as we execute our vision to redefine the healthcare experience. In addition this combination will strengthen our ability to expand and develop new product offerings in a multi-payer approach.""

Signify Health offers health risk assessments value-based care and provider enablement services including a network of 10000 providers across all 50 states. The company acquired Caravan Health earlier this year to further expand its reach in value-based care and home health.

CFO Shawn Guertin told investors Tuesday morning that the deal is one of the first moves under CVS Health's plan to extend further into healthcare services which it first unveiled at the company's investor day earlier this year.

Guertin said that Signify's home health capabilities as well as the services offered by Caravan represent significant opportunities to push toward the company's long-term goals. The value-based care programs at Caravan in particular ""is where a lot of the power is I think for the long haul"" Guertin said.

He also said investors shouldn't read too deeply into CVS' decision to begin in the home health space as it builds out the healthcare services it offers rather than making a primary care buy or focusing in other markets first.

""It's far more important for us to find the right asset with the right scale the right tech and the right team"" Guertin said on the call.

Signify drew interest from multiple competitors including Amazon and UnitedHealth Group both of which are companies that have been active in healthcare M&A.

When the deal closes Armbrester will continue as CEO of Signify under CVS Health.

""As we carefully considered our long-term strategic options we determined that CVS Health is the ideal partner given its focus on expanding access to health services and helping consumers navigate to the best sites of care"" Kyle Armbrester CEO of Signify Health said in the release. ""We are both building an integrated experience that supports a more proactive preventive and holistic approach to patient care and I look forward to executing on our shared vision for the future of care delivery.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvY3ZzLWJ1eS1zaWduaWZ5LWhlYWx0aC04LWJsbi1kZWFsLTIwMjItMDktMDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS to buy Signify Health in $8 bln deal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvY3ZzLWJ1eS1zaWduaWZ5LWhlYWx0aC04LWJsbi1kZWFsLTIwMjItMDktMDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167104A96C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvY3ZzLWJ1eS1zaWduaWZ5LWhlYWx0aC04LWJsbi1kZWFsLTIwMjItMDktMDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVmaW5hbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jdnMtaGVhbHRoLWFkdmFuY2VzLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc3RyYXRlZ3ktYWNxdWlyaW5nLXNpZ25pZnktaGVhbHRoLTgtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Health advances healthcare strategy in acquiring Signify Health for $8 billion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVmaW5hbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jdnMtaGVhbHRoLWFkdmFuY2VzLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc3RyYXRlZ3ktYWNxdWlyaW5nLXNpZ25pZnktaGVhbHRoLTgtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167104A9F90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVmaW5hbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jdnMtaGVhbHRoLWFkdmFuY2VzLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc3RyYXRlZ3ktYWNxdWlyaW5nLXNpZ25pZnktaGVhbHRoLTgtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2VqYXBzZW4vMjAyMi8wOS8wNS9jdnMtaGVhbHRoLWJlc3RzLWFtYXpvbi1yaXZhbHMtZm9yLXNpZ25pZnktaGVhbHRoLXdpdGgtOC1iaWxsaW9uLWJpZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Beats Amazon And Rivals For Signify Health With Winning $8 Billion Bid,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.forbes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sites/brucejapsen/2022/09/05/cvs-health-bests-amazon-rivals-for-signify-health-with-8-billion-bid/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167104A83D0>, 'Connection to www.forbes.com timed out.

The regional casino operator which began in Europe doesn’t have what gaming observers consider a flagship resort. Its two casinos in the historic Colorado mining communities of Central City and Cripple Creek are repurposed storefront-style buildings with a combined 52 hotel rooms that are primarily set aside for casino players.

“Colorado was effectively Century’s beachhead to begin expanding in the U.S” Stifel Financial gaming analyst Jeffrey Stantial said. “At the time Colorado was the only state that was willing to license a brand-new international entrant.”

Century’s casinos in West Virginia and Missouri are one-to-two-hour drives from metropolitan communities and the locations are not considered major tourist destinations.

The company which went public in 1994 and opened a corporate office in Colorado Springs has historically focused its growth internationally including a collection of gaming operations in Alberta Canada and Poland.

The interest changed in 2019 when Century spent $107 million to acquire the operations of two Missouri properties and the West Virginia racetrack casino.

Northern Nevada provides Century an opportunity to prove its operational expertise in a destination market.

The Nugget has 1382 hotel rooms more than triple the combined hotel rooms Century has in its U.S. portfolio. Gaming analysts believe the Nugget will account for an estimated 20 percent of Century’s total annual cash flow once the sale closes in early 2023.

“We have never operated a casino which has so much non-gaming revenue” said Century Executive Vice President Andreas Terler who oversees the company’s U.S operations. “The property has a wonderful team and the Northern Nevada market has a lot of potential.”

Terler who lives in Vienna Austria but is a frequent traveler to the U.S. said Nevada was a target for Century since the company moved into Colorado.

“If you’re a gaming company wouldn’t you want to be in Nevada?” he said. “It’s basically been a dream for us and we’ve been looking for the right opportunity.”

The Nugget was developed by Northern Nevada gaming pioneer John Ascuaga who died in June 2021 at age 96. Las Vegas-based Marnell Gaming acquired the property in 2016 for an undisclosed price.

“I have a lot of respect for John Ascuaga” Terler said. “We are not very different from private owners. We love the properties and we spend time trying to improve them. Anthony and his team have done a great job with the property.”

He said Century has historically kept a property’s management team on board following an acquisition and the same approach is planned for the Nugget.

In the deal with Marnell Gaming Century is paying $100 million for the operations of the Nugget and $95 million for 50 percent ownership of the real estate. Century has a five-year option to purchase the remaining 50 percent of the site located just off of Interstate 80 and roughly three miles from Reno-Tahoe International Airport.

Expanding in the U.S.

Transitioning to a casino company focused on U.S. operations took longer than expected.

Stantial said larger regional casino operators including Penn National Boyd Gaming and Eldorado Resorts dominated the consolidation market during the 2000s and 2010s.

Larger operators are now focused on paying down debt on their balance sheets and launching digital-focused gaming activities such as sports betting and online casinos.

“It’s opened up an opportunity for Century to grow in the U.S. as evidenced by the Nugget deal” Stantial said.

JMP Securities gaming analyst Jordan Bender said Century’s 2019 deal to buy the operations of the Mountaineer Casino and Racetrack in West Virginia and two Missouri riverboat casinos in Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville as part of a $385 million overall transaction with the then-Eldorado Resorts was the turning point in the company’s direction.

The deal happened because Eldorado needed to unwind a potential antitrust issue in Missouri that could have affected the company’s $17.3 billion merger with Caesars Entertainment.

Real estate investment trust VICI Properties acquired the land and buildings for the three locations from Eldorado and leased the casinos back to Century to operate.

Century and VICI teamed up again on Aug. 25 to acquire the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Maryland from Las Vegas-based Golden Entertainment for a combined $260 million. Century is kicking in $56.1 million for the operations while VICI will pay $203.9 million for the land and buildings. Century will pay VICI $15.5 million annually through a lease agreement to manage Rocky Gap increasing its total annual rent payments to the REIT to $41 million.

“VICI has been a very good partner for us” Terler said prior to the Maryland casino transaction.

Terler said Mountaineer which has nearly 1500 slot machines is the Century’s top gaming revenue producer. Cape Girardeau which is located 120 miles south of St. Louis provides Century with its single-largest annual cash flow total. The Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville properties are undergoing expansions that have been slowed due to supply chain disruptions.

“(The Missouri and West Virginia casinos) were very successful acquisitions and the company wanted to keep growing [its] footprint in the U.S.” Bender said.

Terler suggested the Nugget will be the company’s new flagship hotel-casino.

“We’ve learned much in Colorado. We learned about operating in all our markets” he said. “We have certain types of customers who appreciate smaller casinos. Sparks is a market that has tremendous potential.”

Under Marnell Gaming the Nugget received upgrades to its management systems hotel room renovations and construction of an 8500-seat outdoor events center adjacent to the resort.

Bender said Marnell invested $90 million into the upgrades and the property is in good shape.

“There really will not be much investment needed from Century once they take full ownership” Bender said. “Reno is more non-gaming focused and pulls a lot of destination customers from California for concerts events and conventions.”

When the transaction was announced Century cited Northern Nevada’s economic resurgence that saw several technology and manufacturing companies including Google Tesla Switch Amazon and Apple move into the area.

Bender said Reno’s population growth of 15 percent between 2010 and 2020 exceeded the national average of 7.4 percent and an increase in technology and manufacturing jobs has led to wage growth and home prices outpacing the U.S. average.

“That’s a positive tailwind for the market and the wallet size at the casino” Bender said. “Additionally wage growth for Reno feeder markets have all outpaced the U.S. average in the last five years and bodes well for spend at the casino as the market fully recovers.”

Terler said Century is still looking for other Nevada opportunities although Las Vegas is not on the company’s radar even with Caesars looking to sell one of its Strip resorts.

“We’re conservative and cautious. We want to demonstrate that we can deliver” Terler said. “Las Vegas is a different category. Let’s say that's a long-term goal.”

When the Nugget and Rocky Gap deals close next year Century will operate 11 casinos that have 7140 slot machines and 158 table games.

B Riley Securities gaming analyst David Bain noted the pending transactions will transform the Century into “a nearly North American pure-play” business with 94 percent of all cash flow coming from its U.S. and Canadian casinos. In 2019 that figure was 78 percent.

Century has attempted to sell its casinos in Poland but the country borders Ukraine and the conflict with Russia has slowed that process.

Still a Colorado company

Century opened its first Century-branded Colorado casino in 2006 in Central City located 45 minutes west of Denver. The company was involved with another casino operator in Cripple Creek located an hour west of Colorado Springs before expanding to an adjacent casino and adding the Century name to the property.

“As it sits today Colorado is about 10 percent of the company’s earnings” Bender said.

Terler said Century is satisfied with its operation in both markets. The small Central City casino has faced competition from large expansion projects in nearby Black Hawk including a 536-room hotel tower at Ameristar Black Hawk which opened in 2009 and a $442 million expansion at Monarch Black Hawk which included a 516-room hotel tower.

“We have a good base of repeating customers in Black Hawk but these casinos are probably small for us now” he said.

In Cripple Creek Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts is spending $180 million to build the 300-room Chamonix Casino Hotel adjacent to its Bronco Billy’s Casino. The development is across East Bennet Avenue from Century Cripple Creek.

“You know how Cripple Creek works? People never go to just one casino” Terler said. “They love to go across the street. Guess who is across the street?”",,,,,,,,,,,,
