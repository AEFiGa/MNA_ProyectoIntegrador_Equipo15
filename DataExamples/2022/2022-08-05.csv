Senior Fellow

August 5 2022

Note: This analysis does not incorporate the recent change that Senate Democrats have made to the minimum corporate tax provision to prevent it from limiting depreciation breaks. It is reported that this will have a small effect on the overall impact of the provision.

Apple one of the largest corporations in the United States despite manufacturing most of its physical products offshore would likely pay the corporate minimum tax that is included in the Inflation Reduction Act that the Senate is debating this week. 3M a manufacturer that has about 40 percent of its workforce in the United States likely would not pay the corporate minimum tax if current trends in the company’s profits and taxes continue because it is already paying above 15 percent of its profits in taxes.

These figures are based on the profits and tax payments that both companies report in the 10-K that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission and make public. And they illustrate how two corporations characterized as manufacturers could be affected by the proposal.

The federal corporate income tax applies at a rate of 21 percent but many companies effectively pay far less than that because of the special breaks and loopholes that litter the tax code and many pay no income tax in some years. The IRA’s corporate minimum tax is meant to address this problem.

It would apply to companies with more than $1 billion in average global profits over three years. If such a company pays less than 15 percent of its global profits in income taxes (including both U.S. federal income taxes under the regular tax rules and foreign income taxes paid on offshore profits) then it would pay the difference under the proposed provision to bring its global effective tax rate up to 15 percent.

As illustrated in Table 1 below Apple has reported global effective tax rates of less than 15 percent in two of the previous four years.[1] 3M on the other hand has reported global effective tax rates of 19 to 21 percent during these years. If the corporate minimum tax had been in effect during this period it therefore seems likely that it would have affected Apple but not 3M.[2]

It is impossible to know this with certainty because the 10-K does not include all the information one would need to calculate the precise effects of the provision. And the companies’ tax positions could change over time meaning it is difficult to use this information to predict which corporations would or would not be affected by the provision in the future.

Republicans Cite the Provision’s Likely Effect on Manufacturing but “Manufacturing” Can Mean Different Things

Last week Sen. Mike Crapo the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee released a statement arguing that the provision would “overwhelmingly hit American manufacturers and supply chains.”

As ITEP has explained elsewhere Sen. Crapo’s statement relies on an incomplete analysis from Congress’s official revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). It shows that of the $313 billion that would be raised over a decade by the corporate minimum tax about half that amount ($156 billion) would be paid by corporations that describe themselves as mainly manufacturers. Crapo does not mention that the bill would spend $369 billion on energy and climate provisions that would increase manufacturing of electric cars batteries solar panels and other products in the United States.

The principle of the minimum tax – that all successful corporations should pay a reasonable amount of taxes to help finance the public investments that make their success possible – would logically seem to apply to all companies regardless of sector.

Further the JCT report cited by Crapo relies on a broad definition of “manufacturing” that corporations designate for themselves and which includes companies like Apple that do not physically produce much of anything here in the United States. Apple’s physical products are made by suppliers it contracts with including 338 suppliers in Asia (156 in China alone) and only 25 suppliers that are located primarily in the United States.

In fact companies like Apple are precisely why the corporate minimum tax is needed. A 2013 Senate hearing exposed the convoluted accounting gimmicks the company used to claim profits were generated by subsidiaries in Ireland that were for tax purposes not resident of any country and thus not taxed. When under international pressure the Irish government began to crack down Apple shifted its strategy to another tax haven the tiny island of Jersey. This was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” a trove of documents from the Bermuda-based law firm that helped Apple pull off this feat.

3M could not be more different from Apple. Most Americans probably know 3M as a manufacturer of tape sandpaper and medical supplies including masks worn to avoid Covid. 3M is a huge conglomerate but with profits ranging from $5 billion to $7 billion in recent years it seems small compared to Apple with its recent global profits exceeding $100 billion. As of 2020 3M reported that it had 96000 employees and that 39000 of those around 40 percent of the total were in the United States.

There has been little if any attention paid by the media to 3M’s tax strategies. This is not to say that the company eschews tax avoidance for any altruistic or ethical reason. But the simple fact is that its global effective tax rate each year has been a bit higher than Apple’s and high enough to avoid paying under the IRA’s corporate minimum tax.

Table 2 below provides a more detailed version of the information in Table 1 above about the two companies’ profits and taxes.

[1] The federal income tax shown here for the companies does not include a transition tax they both paid in 2018 ($37.3 billion in the case of Apple $97 million in the case of 3M) under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on offshore profits that they had reported in earlier years.

[2] The federal tax shown here is the “current” tax that the companies report for the tax year which is their best estimate of what they will ultimately pay for the tax year. This is the most useful number reported in the 10-K to understand what companies pay for specific tax years. It does not include deferred taxes which are taxes that companies expect and plan to pay in the future. The U.S. profits are taken from the 10-K and state income taxes are subtracted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy1uZXh0LWJpZy1yZXZlbnVlLTE3MTgwNjczOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple: Is Advertising the Next Big Revenue Generator? Analyst Weighs In,"The Apple (AAPL) empire might be spearheaded by its flagship product the iPhone but along with plenty of other hardware offerings its Services segment has been growing at a fast pace. There’s also talk of a “game changing” AV/VR headset and even of an Apple Car at some point.

But Needham analyst Laura Martin thinks there’s also the prospect of another big revenue stream.

“We believe AAPL is in the early stages of building a new mobile advertising platform” says Martin who thinks ad revenue could be a “material upside value driver” for the tech giant for several reasons.

For one there’s the offensive element. Apple being the largest company in the world to keep on growing it must focus on big global TAMs (total addressable markets). As eMarketer expects the global digital advertising market to reach $600 billion this year it certainly qualifies as one.

There’s also a defensive element as explained by Martin: “Creating a privacy-first ad platform would solve a problem for AAPL's ad-driven apps which have seen their ad revs fall after iOS replaced IDFA with ATT in 3Q21.”

It also amounts to a clever tactical move. Apple operates as a “Walled Garden” and its user data is “best-in-class.” All the while it is also reducing the tracking and transparency data accessible to other companies. This gives the company’s “pricing power” a boost.

Martin is not just speculating on the matter. There’s evidence of Apple's advertising ambitions as the company's recent job postings imply a new AdTech platform is being built. Since the early months of the year there has been a notable increase in the company’s recruiting activity for its Ad Platform unit. Just recently Apple put up a job opening for ""a senior manager for its DSP in its ads platforms business who will drive the design of the most privacy-forward sophisticated demand side platform possible."" Moreover Apple made its presence felt during June’s Cannes Lions advertising festival. This suggests to Martin the company is trying to “drive awareness among marketers that it is in the advertising business.”

So down to the nitty-gritty what does it all mean for investors? Martin reiterated a Buy rating on Apple shares backed by a $170 price target suggesting shares are fairly valued right now. (To watch Martin’s track record click here)

The Street’s average target is a touch higher; at $180.11 the figure leaves room for a 9% upside from current levels. All told based on 22 Buys 6 Holds and 1 Sell the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See Apple stock forecast on TipRanks)

Demand from chipmakers for Lam Research's (LRCX -0.63%) tools drove its stock price to all-time highs by mid-January 2022. However the stock has underperformed since reaching those highs amid labor shortages COVID-19-related supply chain constraints industrywide shortages and rising logistics costs. Moreover now that it looks like a recession is increasingly likely some investors wonder whether they should avoid this company since demand for its products could rapidly deteriorate.

Here are three reasons Lam looks like an excellent long-term investment at today's prices.

1. Demand for semiconductors drives Lam's results

Lam is a wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturer building the machines that manufacture semiconductors. Its main customers are companies like Intel (INTC 0.30%) Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -0.56%) and SK Hynix to name a few.

We live in an age of accelerating innovation and many of the newest technologies in highest demand rely on smaller and better chips which semiconductor manufacturers can only make with Lam's advanced tools. Fortunately for Lam its devices have few alternatives and are in high demand.

What drives that demand? According to global research firm McKinsey three industries will drive 70% of semiconductor's future growth: automotive computation and data storage and wireless. As the end demand for advanced chips from those industries rises semiconductor companies will need more of Lam's tools to build those chips -- driving its revenues and earnings higher.

2. Lam is a market leader

Since its founding in 1981 Lam has elevated itself to owning some of the market's most advanced and popular chipmaking tools. For example its tools have cumulatively processed over 40 million more wafers than its nearest competition -- demonstrating its technological superiority. And in addition to leading its competitors in key areas Lam has an installed base of over 75000 systems -- a substantial competitive advantage for three reasons.

First once a chip manufacturer decides to buy Lam works closely with the customer to tailor its tools to the customer's chipmaking process flow. From this it gains valuable insights on how to improve its devices.

Second once a customer installs Lam's tools into their chipmaking process the cost becomes prohibitive to switch to a competitor's solution.

Third Lam has scale advantages meaning it can use its size in the industry to negotiate the purchase of raw materials products and logistical services at a lower price per unit than many smaller competitors.

3. Lam makes significant improvements

Two particularly nasty problems left in the wake of the pandemic are supply chain disruptions and inflation -- complications that you can see hit Lam's gross margins in the March quarter along with a the margins of few other WFE manufacturers.

LRCX Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts

In the June quarter the company continued to have problems managing costs in freight and logistics semiconductors and other critical components for manufacturing WFE tools. Management expects inflation and supply chain disruptions to persist to at least the end of 2022 so investors shouldn't expect massive improvements in gross margin this year.

However expect improvement over the long term. Management has devoted significant resources to making the company more resistant to economic shocks. For instance Lam has recently focused on cutting logistics costs by moving company resources closer to its suppliers and customers in the U.S. and globally. These recent supply chain improvements are one reason that despite inflationary and supply chain disruptions Lam just concluded its second consecutive fiscal year of record revenue and diluted earnings per share (Lam's fiscal year ended on June 27).

Eventually recent improvements will show up in improved gross margins and operational efficiencies. And the company should emerge from this period of economic disruption as a far more robust and resilient company.

Lam is selling at a fantastic valuation

As I write this the market values Lam at a PEG ratio of 0.62 and most investors consider any company with a PEG ratio under 1.0 undervalued. Therefore the market may have already priced in the possibility of a mild to moderate recession. And if you are an investor able to withstand some short-term market gyrations you should consider picking up a few shares of this high-quality company today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29kbmF2aWdhdG9yLmNvbS9BcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDgvMDUvZGV0ZWN0LW5pdHJpdGVzLXdpdGgtYS1zbWFydHBob25lLWNvbG91ci1jaGFuZ2luZy1maWxtLWRldmVsb3BlZC10by1jaGVjay1uaXRyaXRlLWxldmVscy1pbi1jdXJlZC1tZWF00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detect nitrites with a smartphone?

In the same way that people take an umbrella with them when it is raining they should consider wearing a face mask if COVID-19 cases are starting to rise or if a new wave is forecast.

Stepping up precautions as cases climb can help control infection rates.

We can take the same approach with testing ventilation and social distancing.

Thankfully the UK now looks to be past the peak of both the recent heatwave and the latest COVID wave. But there will be more of both – and in future we might think about how we protect ourselves from COVID in the same way we protect ourselves from the weather.

An umbrella is a useful analogy. If we look out the window or check the weather forecast and see rain we would probably take an umbrella out with us. Similarly if COVID cases are starting to rise or if a new wave is forecast we might consider grabbing a face mask for example.

But just as there’s no need to carry an umbrella with us when it’s sunny we needn’t be expected to wear masks all the time. Of course some people may choose to wear masks more consistently in certain settings while others may forgo wearing them altogether. This is the nature of the current phase of the pandemic we’re in a big part of which is based on personal choice and responsibility.

Thanks largely to the impact of vaccines we no longer need the kind of rules-based approach to risk management we saw earlier in the pandemic. But the umbrella analogy can guide our behaviour and choices in a variety of areas of our response moving forward. Beyond masks these include testing ventilation and social distancing.

The idea is that we can pick up or step up precautions when we most need them (when COVID cases are on the rise) before relaxing them if we want to when infection rates and risk are lower.

What might this look like in practice?

Let’s say we start to see COVID cases rising again come autumn. This is a distinct possibility.

It then becomes even more important to take a test if we have any symptoms that might be COVID-related. This will help inform our decision of whether and to what extent to minimise contact with others.

Isolation is no longer a legal requirement and I think this should remain the case. However if possible staying at home while we’re unwell is a sensible and considerate thing to do particularly when COVID rates are high.

Distancing should also remain a choice. But during a wave of infections people might wish to maintain more distance between themselves and others in shops or may choose to avoid crowded venues.

Back on masks when cases begin to rise the risk of contracting and transmitting COVID also rises so masks become a more useful and reasonable precaution. They can be particularly valuable in certain circumstances – for example if someone is unwell but can’t isolate when visiting people who are vulnerable or in crowded indoor spaces.

Opening windows even a little can increase fresh air indoors and also help reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus.

Finally the number of people in the UK who have had a COVID booster vaccine is considerably lower than the number who received their first and second doses. We know immunity from vaccines wanes and boosters restore vaccine effectiveness. So if we start to see rising cases or looking ahead to future waves it would make good sense for people who are behind on their vaccines to get up-to-date.

Shared responsibility

It’s been a year since England’s “freedom day” when most legal COVID measures were removed. But the pandemic is far from over. Along with high numbers of daily infections long COVID is very common and the pressure on the NHS is still unsustainable.

In a recent article in the British Medical Journal Professor Susan Michie and I reflected on some of the lessons we’ve learned over the past year.

Among these the pandemic has shown us that behaviour is not purely down to an individual’s choice or motivation. People’s actions are also shaped by the opportunities and supports they’re given – or not given. For example while some people might want to stay home if they have symptoms they may not if neither their employer or the government provides financial support.

People should be encouraged and supported as much as possible to stay home when they’re sick particularly when cases are high. Amidst a winter COVID wave Australia has re-instated its pandemic leave disaster payments to enable those with COVID and without proper sick pay to stay home and not lose out financially.

Further governments could ensure that free at-home tests are available during times when infections are likely to or starting to rise.

And it’s important that to mitigate the impacts of future waves vaccination coverage is as high as possible. Public health campaigns should target both the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated as well as encouraging people (particularly the most vulnerable) to take up booster offers.

We also need more action to ensure adequate ventilation. In the US billions of dollars are being made available for improving air quality in schools and other public buildings.

I’ve previously argued that the UK government puts too much responsibility in the hands of the public. Just like climate change pandemics are global problems and addressing them requires a collective effort.

Argentina will hence become the first country in Latin America to launch a ‘Binance card’. The ‘Binance Card’ is the crypto firm’s perfect move to facilitate cryptocurrency adoption worldwide.

#Binance teams up with @Mastercard to launch a new prepaid card in Argentina bringing crypto payments into the region 🇦🇷



Users can enjoy:

🔸 Making purchases in crypto (#BTC #BNB & more)

🔸 Up to 8% in crypto cashback

🔸 Zero fees on ATM withdrawals — Binance (@binance) August 4 2022



Binance card is in the beta phase and will be available globally in the coming weeks.



Credencial Payments has issued the Binance Card to let both new and existing Binance users in Argentina with a valid national ID purchase and make payments with cryptos like Bitcoin and BNB.



The card can be used at over 90 million Mastercard merchants globally both in-store and online.



The card will unleash a seamless transactional experience in which their cryptos will be converted to fiat in real-time during the purchase and also get up to 8% crypto cashback on a few limited purchases. Note that ATM withdrawals would be free. (However third-party services and network fees may apply).



Binance cardholders can manage their cards via the card dashboard on the Binance App as well as on the website. Users can also take a look at their transaction history and access customer support via the card dashboard.



Walter Pimenta Executive VP Mastercard Latin America and the Caribbean said “Our work with digital currencies builds on our strong foundation to enable choice and peace of mind when people shop and pay.”



Maximiliano Hinz general director of Binance in Latin America commented that through the Binance Card merchants will receive fiat while users pay in cryptocurrency of their choice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS92aWRlby8yMDIyLzA4LzA1L3dhdGNoLWNuYmNzLWZ1bGwtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXdpdGgtbGlua2VkaW5zLWthcmluLWtpbWJyb3VnaC1hbmQtbWFzdGVyY2FyZHMtbWljaGVsbGUtbWV5ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch CNBC's full interview with LinkedIn's Karin Kimbrough and Mastercard's Michelle Meyer,"Share Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email

Binance is launching its crypto debit card in Argentina the first country in Latin America to have the product thanks to a partnership with Mastercard.

Binance debit card works just the same as any other bank card except it isn’t linked to a mobile banking app but a crypto wallet.

Binance lets clients top-up their card with funds through the Binance Card App and then convert their crypto holdings to fiat within seconds which can be spent at over 90 million Mastercard merchants worldwide. As such the card doesn’t directly connect to the platform’s customer account.

Binance card holders can earn up to 8% in crypto cashback on eligible purchases and enjoy zero fees on ATM withdrawals. Clients can pre-select the digital wallet they want to debit when they fund the card balance. The latter can currently hold only two digital currencies namely Bitcoin and Binance’s native token BNB.

Whenever a cardholder makes a payment Binance Card instantly converts the cryptocurrencies into other fiat currencies and automatically deducts all expenses and commissions which yet to be disclosed.

“Our work with digital currencies builds on our strong foundation to enable choice and peace of mind when people shop and pay. Together with our partners Mastercard has been leading the payments industry in enabling entry to this exciting new world helping bring millions of additional users into crypto and other digital assets in a safe and trusted manner” said Walter Pimenta Executive Vice President Products and Innovation Mastercard Latin America and the Caribbean.

“Payments is one of the first and most obvious use cases for crypto yet adoption has a lot of room to grow. By using the Binance Card merchants continue to receive fiat and the users pay in cryptocurrency they choose. We believe the Binance Card is a significant step in encouraging wider crypto use and global adoption and now it is available for users from Argentina” said Maximiliano Hinz general director of Binance in Latin America.

Binance has already signed a partnership with Simplex to enable users to buy cryptocurrencies with their credit cards. This collaboration allows Binance’s international users to make fiat deposits via a debit or credit card which effectively provides a fiat onramp for its clients around the world. Users are routed to checkout with the EU-registered fintech company which takes care of the authorization payment processing and delivery of cryptocurrencies. This makes using bank cards more straightforward and also taps Simplex’s expertise in verifying and securing crypto transactions.

Specially issued crypto cards are becoming the norm that is quite popular since they allow users to cash out their digital assets and spend them at thousands of credit card-accepting merchants worldwide. These cards resolve one of the greatest drawbacks of cryptocurrencies which is the inability to use them in everyday life with the same ease as traditional currencies.

Latin America ranks fifth in the world for cryptocurrency adoption and consistently captures between 8% and 10% of global cryptocurrency activity. The region saw a ten-fold increase in the use of cryptocurrencies over the last two years. Leading the way are Venezuela and Argentina ranking seventh and tenth respectively in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index published by Chainalysis."

In the game which was held on July 21 the Israeli team defeated the nominally American team which was in fact made up not only of Americans but also Israeli and British basketball players due to the small pool of athletes eligible to participate in the games.

“We originally had a team of six but two of them went off to the world championships in Thailand and one stayed behind because of COVID” said Moshe Kraiem a member of the US team.

To ensure that there was a sufficient number of athletes the Israeli delegation sent their own players to the US team keeping the competition ongoing.

Maccabiah wheelchair basketball had its brief spotlight in the American public eye last month after ESPN broadcast a last-minute three-point shot by Alon Dorron an Israeli player for the combined US team.

The tournament presented US team coach Michael Rosenkrantz with the opportunity to visit Israel for the first time in his life. Although his ability to coach the team while in Israel was hampered by his contraction of COVID he was able to make it to all the games after being released the week earlier.

“We really were only to hold one practice” he said. “I had COVID so I wasn’t even able to go to the practice so that made it a little bit difficult to be cohesive.”

Rosenkrantz maintains that additional preparation as a unified team would have helped their performance in the finals.

Rosenkrantz got his start in wheelchair basketball while working as a volunteer in India where he coached basketball at the New Delhi YMCA. Two years into his assignment he met people from a group called Wheelchair Athletes Worldwide while on a brief trip back to the US.

“Their mission was to bring sports wheelchairs to countries and do projects. I said ‘You guys need to come to India’ and so in November 2011 they came and we did two weekend workshops in wheelchair basketball” said Rosenkrantz. In 2012 he continued to coach the sport in Nepal.

Rosenkrantz discovered Maccabiah due to his involvement with the National Wheelchair Basketball Association while coaching in the US. The organization sent out a notice looking for Jewish wheelchair basketball players to play for the 21st Maccabiah Games. He reached out offering to coach the team and was accepted.

“There’s no reason why Maccabiah can’t have more adaptive sports teams” Rosenkrantz said. “I think it’s really important that this becomes bigger for the Maccabiah Games. I know there are Jewish athletes out there with disability 10-15% of any country’s population are people with disability the question is about finding those athletes.”

Seth Goldberg the US team captain felt the Maccabiah did a good job of respecting wheelchair basketball as a sport. The sport for instance is part of the general competition it’s not a separate event. The Israeli team’s gold medal counts toward the delegation’s overall tally.

“The Maccabiah Games are an inclusive and diverse organization” said Goldberg who has been playing wheelchair basketball since he was 10 years old.

“Back at home there’s the Olympics and the Paralympics they have two separate contests. What’s really unique about Maccabiah is that they incorporate able-bodied and paralympic athletes into one.”

Although Goldberg was satisfied with how the games were organized not all of the players believed that Maccabiah did the sport justice.

“It was basically just us playing ourselves and that’s disappointing” said Amit Vigoda a member of the Israeli team and the season’s MVP. “But you know at the end of the day there’s not really that many disabled Jewish people around the world.”

At the age of 11 Vigoda had his leg amputated below the knee due to an orthopedic condition that caused his leg to continuously fracture. He doesn’t use a wheelchair in his day-to-day life but uses it masterfully on the court almost as an extension of his own body.

For the past two years the 20-year-old Vigoda has been playing wheelchair basketball abroad. After playing for a year for the University of Texas at Arlington he moved to Germany to play for Hannover United.

“Before I got to basketball in my head I thought that a wheelchair is something that makes you seem more disabled but for me it became a tool to participate in my sport” said Vigoda. “Just like a skier needs skis I need my wheelchair.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvcGdsLWFybGluZ3Rvbi1tYWpvci0yMDIyLWRheS0yLW1hdGNoLWFuYWx5c2lzLWFuZC1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PGL Arlington Major 2022 Day 2 Match Analysis and Predictions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvcGdsLWFybGluZ3Rvbi1tYWpvci0yMDIyLWRheS0yLW1hdGNoLWFuYWx5c2lzLWFuZC1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81BC0610>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvcGdsLWFybGluZ3Rvbi1tYWpvci0yMDIyLWRheS0yLW1hdGNoLWFuYWx5c2lzLWFuZC1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2xlYWd1ZS1vZi1sZWdlbmRzLWVzcG9ydHMvZ2FtZS1icmVha2luZy1sZWFndWUtb2YtbGVnZW5kcy1idWctcnVpbnMtbWF0Y2gtZm9yLXByby10ZWFtLTE4OTUyNTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Game breaking League of Legends bug ruins match for pro team,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2xlYWd1ZS1vZi1sZWdlbmRzLWVzcG9ydHMvZ2FtZS1icmVha2luZy1sZWFndWUtb2YtbGVnZW5kcy1idWctcnVpbnMtbWF0Y2gtZm9yLXByby10ZWFtLTE4OTUyNTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81DFD420>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2xlYWd1ZS1vZi1sZWdlbmRzLWVzcG9ydHMvZ2FtZS1icmVha2luZy1sZWFndWUtb2YtbGVnZW5kcy1idWctcnVpbnMtbWF0Y2gtZm9yLXByby10ZWFtLTE4OTUyNTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vaW1wYWN0LXdyZXN0bGluZy1ldmVyeS1yaWMtZmxhaXItdG5hLW1hdGNoLXJhbmtlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Ric Flair TNA/Impact Wrestling Match Ranked Worst To Best,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vaW1wYWN0LXdyZXN0bGluZy1ldmVyeS1yaWMtZmxhaXItdG5hLW1hdGNoLXJhbmtlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Company valuation is something of a nebulous concept. After all how exactly can you describe what a company is or should be worth? Simply use share price and you’ll be missing out on a huge part of the story as share prices can be manipulated or split and they don’t give an accurate valuation number of a company as a whole. One method that’s quite popular among investors and analysts is market capitalization which does incorporate share price and also the number of shares that a company has outstanding. By this metric McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) had a market cap of over $191.58 billion as of Aug. 4.

McDonald’s has taken a long road to get to a valuation in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The company evolved in two very distinct phases. The original founders the McDonald brothers shepherded the first incarnation of the restaurant from its inception in 1940 to its sale in 1961. From there visionary Ray Kroc whose name became synonymous with the McDonald’s known and loved the world over today took over. The rest as they say is history.

Here’s a look at McDonald’s current financial position plus an overview of the company’s history and future projections to help you decide if you should invest in the stock.

McDonald’s: Company Snapshot Headquarters Chicago Year Founded 1940 Founders Dick and Mac McDonald CEO Chris Kempczinski

Measuring McDonald’s Net Worth

One of the reasons that market capitalization is a popular measure of a company’s worth is that it’s easy to calculate. All you need is a company’s current stock price and its total number of outstanding shares. By way of example assume a company has five million outstanding shares and a current stock price of $20. That company would have a market cap of $100 million or five million outstanding shares times its current stock price of $20. McDonald’s has about 739.55 million outstanding shares of stock so 739.55 million times the closing price of $262.09 on Aug. 3 equals over $191.58 billion.

Because share prices for stocks are all over the map market cap helps level the playing field when making comparisons. White Mountains Insurance Group for example had a share price of $1253.68 on Aug. 4. This is almost five times as much as McDonald’s share price on the same date. But there’s no comparison between the two when it comes to company size as defined by market cap. White Mountains Insurance Group only has 2.95 million outstanding shares giving it a market cap of just $3.69 billion — well below that of McDonald’s. This example shows how market cap is a more useful way to understand the true size of a company regardless of its share price.

That said it’s important to note that market cap is not the only way investors can value a company. In fact because market cap is tied to a company’s share price it changes from moment to moment. Market cap is also wholly unrelated to any of the internal financial metrics of the company such as growth rate earnings per share or book value. For this reason many investors prefer to use a metric such as price-to-earnings ratio to evaluate the current valuation of a company.

McDonald’s Market Cap

Market cap can change from moment to moment based on a company’s current share price. McDonald’s stock price has fluctuated over the past year:

52-week share price range: $217.68-$271.15

As a result McDonald’s market cap has also fluctuated over that same time period. It currently sits at $191.58 billion.

McDonald’s Net Worth

McDonald’s net worth as of 2021 is negative $4.6 billion. It might seem odd for one of the most well-known companies in the world to have a negative net worth but to a large degree this is an accounting entry. McDonald’s is most definitely an earnings machine generating over $1.64 billion in net income just for the last quarter of the year.

Of course methods of determining the valuation of a company are wide and varied each with its own merits and blind spots.

GOBankingRates uses company data to calculate net worth in a slightly different manner. The GOBankingRates Evaluation of company net worth is a calculation of a company’s worth based solely on concrete measurable figures like assets and revenue. It’s a more conservative evaluation than most taking into account only full-year profits and revenue from the last three years and the company’s assets and debts.

By this GOBankingRates metric McDonald’s has a net worth of $36.53 billion.

What Is McDonald’s Worth? Share Price 52-Week Range $217.68-$271.15 Fiscal Year 2021 Revenue $23.22 billion Fiscal Year 2021 Profit $7.55 billion GOBankingRates’ Evaluation of McDonald’s Net Worth $36.53 billion All information on the 52-week range is accurate as of Aug. 4 2022.

Some investors prefer net worth over market cap when valuing a company because it represents actual financial value so much so that “shareholders’ equity” is another way that accountants describe company net worth. Of course accounting methods can alter the amount of net worth that a company like McDonald’s might report so it’s not always an authoritative source of a company’s true value.

Did You Know? Dick and Mac McDonald got everything started back in 1940 when they first opened McDonald’s Bar-B-Q restaurant in San Bernardino California. The first McDonald’s was a traditional drive-in restaurant with carhop service and a large menu. It wasn’t until 1948 that the founders reinvented the restaurant converting it into a self-service drive-in and reducing the menu to just nine items. After debuting triple-thick milkshakes in 1949 the McDonald brothers met Multimixer salesman Ray Kroc who saw the potential in the restaurant and became a nationwide franchising agent in 1954. Kroc took the step of buying out the McDonald brothers in 1961 paying $2.7 million for the rights to the restaurant.

Key Product Lines Contributing To McDonald’s Revenue

For an immense international multibillion-dollar company McDonald’s has a surprisingly simple balance sheet. The revenue the company generates essentially comes from just two broad components: sales by company-operated restaurants and revenues from franchised restaurants.

Sales by company-operated restaurants are self-explanatory. Every time you buy a Big Mac from a company-operated McDonald’s the corporation itself books the revenue. But for the company’s franchised restaurants which account for about 93% of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide the parent company earns money differently.

Rather than booking the direct revenue from sales at franchised restaurants McDonald’s recognizes revenue from rents royalties and initial fees paid by franchisees.

Here’s the revenue reported by McDonald’s by operating segment for the quarter ending June 30:

Sales by company-operated restaurants: $2.11 billion

$2.11 billion Revenues from franchised restaurants: $3.52 billion comprised of rents and royalties

All in all the company reported revenue in excess of $5.6 billion just in its most recent quarter.

Current Top McDonald’s Shareholders

As with many companies all of the top 10 shareholders of McDonald’s stock are mutual fund companies or asset managers. Overall institutions own 69.60% of all McDonald’s shares.

Here’s what the list of top 10 shareholders looks like:

The Vanguard Group 9.06% of shares Blackrock Inc. 6.82% of shares State Street Corp. 4.92% of shares Wellington Management Co.

Since mutual funds own a large percentage of McDonald’s stocks the odds are good that if you’re a mutual fund or exchange-traded-fund investor you already own a piece of McDonald’s. Here are the percentages of McDonald’s stock that are owned by popular mutual funds and exchange-traded funds:

How Does the Future Look for McDonald’s?

McDonald’s brand recognition is a huge asset and it’s hard to bet against industry leaders over the long run. But how has the stock been trading lately and have earnings been rising fast enough to support future gains?

McDonald’s engine was still humming as the first half of 2022 drew to a close. In its earnings release for the second quarter of 2022 which ended on June 30 McDonald’s reported earnings per share of $2.55 beating analysts’ expectations by 8 cents according to CNBC. Revenue fell short at $5.72 billion vs. $5.81 expected representing a 3% decrease since last quarter but contributing to 8% growth over the last six months.

Global comparable sales grew 9.7% reflecting growth across all segments. Growth for the U.S. segment was 3.7% driven by price increases across the everyday menu and digital offerings.

Challenges acknowledged in the release include negative comparable sales in China due to ongoing pandemic restrictions restaurant closures in Ukraine and Russia and the effects of inflation on labor and commodity costs.

“The McDonald’s System continues to demonstrate strength and resiliency” said McDonald’s President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski. “Nonetheless the operating environment across the competitive landscape remains challenging.”

Should You Invest In McDonald’s?

Investing in any single stock is a risky proposition. Although individual stocks have the potential for significant gains they can also be volatile and lose money for extended periods of time. That’s why many financial advisors recommend that investors diversify their portfolios with no single stock comprising more than 5% of a total portfolio.

In addition to analyzing the financials of McDonald’s you should take a look at your own personal financial situation before deciding to invest in the stock. Define your investment objectives and assess how much risk you’re willing to take with your portfolio before taking the plunge. Consider working with a fiduciary financial advisor to help you understand the pros and cons of stock investments in general and McDonald’s in particular.

Based on Wall Street estimates McDonald’s might indeed still be a good buy. Fifteen of 33 analysts reported by Yahoo Finance have a “buy” rating on the stock and eight rate it a “strong buy.” The average consensus price target among analysts is $279.87 about 8% above its $259.02 price at mid-day on Aug. 4.

Base value is established by subtracting total liabilities from total assets from the company’s last full fiscal year. Income value is established by taking the average of the revenue from the last three full fiscal years plus 10 times the average of the net profits from the last three full fiscal years and then calculating the average of those two figures. The final GOBankingRates Evaluation number is the sum of the base value and the income value.

Dallas College — in partnership with Collin College Tarrant County College and University of Texas at Arlington — announced Wednesday August 3 a groundbreaking $8.8 million grant by the U.S. Economic Development Administration to fund and create a regional career pathway model in biotechnology.

According to Dallas Innovates seven North Texas healthcare and life science businesses like UT Southwestern McKesson Evolve Biologics and Texas Health Resources have already signed up to hire a combined 1100 biotech workers from the program for positions like clinical lab techs and pharmaceutical manufacturing operators.

Dallas College officials hope this grant aimed at training the region’s future biotech workforce will help put North Texas in the company of major biotech hubs like the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill “triangle” an area already home to numerous life science companies like Merck & Co Pfizer Novo Nordisk and more.

The Dallas Morning News reports that Dallas College started to work on its application for the grant in September. “The [Economic Development Administration] was looking for something regional” said Ben Magill associate vice chancellor of economic opportunity at Dallas College during a news conference at BioLab. “They wanted to bring regions together. People don’t pay attention to city lines anymore and neither do companies.”

According to Magill DFW is projected to add over 200000 jobs over the next three years. “And this award will help us establish the critical economic and workforce development infrastructure needed to fill those jobs increase economic mobility for underserved communities and create additional jobs.”

Tom Luce CEO of Biotech Initiatives at Lyda Hill Philanthropies echoed Magill’s expectations in a statement: “Of all jobs in Dallas only 40% are currently considered ‘good jobs.’ Thanks to this grant that share will increase and thereby help to strengthen our health care institutions and our region’s economic vitality.”

Commercial Cafe recently ranked DFW as number 16 out of the top 20 U.S. metros to foster the most favorable combination of factors for the life sciences sector. According to their estimates 744000 residents aged 25 years or older hold at least a bachelor’s degree in science and engineering and/or engineering-related fields and the metro’s relatively accessible office market attracted brands like BioLab which opened its ninth location in Dallas a 37000-square-foot co-working space at Pegasus Park.

“This award will be a catalyst” said Magill “Health care and health care support occupations are expected to be the fastest-growing industry sector among those jobs expanding by about 8% or more in the next few years.”

The new platform allows influencers to host livestreams earn revenue and engage with viewers. The company has reportedly paid influencers between $200 and $3000 to use the platform for 30 minutes. Super entered development in late 2020 and is currently being built by Meta’s New Product Experimentation team.

“Super is a small standalone experiment being built by New Product Experimentation (NPE) and currently testing with a small group of creators” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email.

Business Insider reports that Meta has recently reached out to multiple creators asking them to try out the new project. The platform which looks to have similar functionality to Twitch is currently being tested with fewer than 100 creators including tech influencer Andru Edwards and TikTok star Vienna Skye.

The platform currently operates on a tiered system where viewers pay for access to features included in the stream. Viewers can also leave a tip for livestreamers. The report indicates that creators pocket 100% of the tips and revenue earned through the tiered system.

“Right now it’s web only” a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. “They have been testing it very quietly for about two years. The end goal [of NPE projects] is ultimately creating the next standalone project that could be part of the Meta family of products.”

Meta’s early testing of Super comes as the company recently announced that Facebook is shutting down its live shopping feature on October 1 to shift its focus to Reels. Livestream video shopping became publicly available on Facebook two years ago following a series of smaller trials and beta tests. A live shopping platform could have ultimately served as a significant revenue stream for Facebook thanks to selling fees applied at checkout.

Livestream shopping is becoming increasingly popular in Asia and particularly in China. However because Facebook and TikTok are both walking back their live shopping plans it seems that general consumer awareness and adoption of live video shopping is still low outside of Asia.

However the early testing of Super shows that Meta believes there’s a market for a livestream platform for influencers and creators. Meta is still in the early testing phase for the platform and will likely tweak it according to feedback from creators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA1L21ldGEtc2h1dHMtZG93bi1ydXNzaWFuLXRyb2xsLWZhcm0tbGlua2VkLXRvLXNhbmN0aW9uZWQtcHV0aW4tYWxsedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta shuts down Russian troll farm linked to sanctioned Putin ally,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/08/05/meta-shuts-down-russian-troll-farm-linked-to-sanctioned-putin-ally on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA1L21ldGEtc2h1dHMtZG93bi1ydXNzaWFuLXRyb2xsLWZhcm0tbGlua2VkLXRvLXNhbmN0aW9uZWQtcHV0aW4tYWxsedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTA1L21ldGEtYW1vbmctY29tcGFuaWVzLW1ha2luZy1zdW1tZXItaW50ZXJucy1uZXJ2b3VzLWFib3V0LWpvYnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Delays Job Offers for Summer Interns Making Gen Z Sweat,"Why did this happen?

He saw the people in the parking lots dressed in LT Eli and Saquon jerseys and allowed himself a momentary break from the daily grind.

He was the head coach of the New York Giants about to lead an NFL team into an NFL stadium for the first time.

“Just driving in and seeing the fan base out here and you’re like ‘It’s a pretty cool history and a humbling moment for me to be in this position’” Daboll told The Post. “To see all the fans out there for the first time knowing that you’re their head coach and then to stand on the sideline — yeah it was a bunch of firsts. Even thought it was just a practice a bunch of firsts.”

It might be silly to attach any significance to a Blue-White scrimmage that doubled as a Fan Fest at MetLife. Some 26000 people gathered to watch Daniel Jones do some good and some not-so-good things against his own defense and maybe half of those fans were just looking for something to do while letting the traffic ease up before their late-night drives to the Shore.

But they showed up to watch something fairly meaningless that was pretty damn meaningful to their rookie head coach. At 47 Daboll had never run a team on any level. He started out as a volunteer assistant at William & Mary and worked his way onto the staffs of Bill Belichick and Nick Saban before riding his success as Bills offensive coordinator into the big job with the Giants.

Brian Daboll stands on the MetLife Stadium sideline for the first time as Giants head coach. Robert Sabo for the NY POST

“I’ve done this for 25 years” he said in June “so it’s not like I was a coach for five years and got on a hot swing. This is 25 years in the making a lot of good ups and some downs that you learn from. A lot of ‘nos’ a lot of not getting jobs. So every day I thank my lucky stars that … I’m the head coach of a football team let alone the New York Football Giants. What an honor that is.”

And that honor made a mark on him before this intrasquad scrimmage. After he was done coaching on the field and fielding questions in the press conference room Daboll was walking down the MetLife corridor when asked if the occasion meant anything to him. He paused and appeared on the verge of getting emotional.

“It’s hard to put into words” he told The Post. “It was a different feeling walking into the stadium for the first time as a head coach walking into the head coach’s office instead of a big room with the assistants. I kind of sat there before the scrimmage. It’s humbling. It’s very humbling. I understand the role and I just want to do a really good job for our organization and for our fan base.

“But it was certainly a pretty cool moment for me.”

Nobody knows how Daboll will be as a head coach just as nobody knew how another rookie Joe Judge would be the first time around. Judge was not a disaster — he just authored his own disastrous ending. But even an amateur detective could scan recent quotes from the holdover Judge players and determine that they prefer (so far) the way Daboll is running this operation from his energy to his methods of communication to the freedom he’s giving his outside playmakers to you know make plays.

Brian Daboll Robert Sabo for the NY POST

One Giants source with deep long-standing ties to the organization said “The whole building loves Daboll.” Asked if it seemed the majority of veteran Giants are making it clear that they appreciate Daboll’s management style to Judge’s the source said: “One hundred percent. They’re not making any attempt to hide that.”

Tyrod Taylor a 12-year veteran who wasn’t a Judge player but who has seen a ton of coaches come and go said Daboll has impressed him every day with his command of the locker room and meeting rooms and with the way he has earned the team’s respect.

“He does a great job of keeping everyone involved but also not withholding information” Taylor said. “He’s straightforward with us.”

Of course that player connection won’t matter if it doesn’t show up on the scoreboard. Given that the Giants have lost 10 or more games in five straight seasons Daboll clearly has to teach his team how to win. In order to do that he said he has tried to create an ultracompetitive environment in every aspect of his program “whether that’s in the cafeteria at the walk through in the locker room. Everything’s about competition. … We’re committed to a process of trying to improve and do things a certain way.”

Coaches get so locked into that process that they don’t often break away and appreciate the small things for the big things they really are. But Friday night during an early August drive that didn’t even cover a mile and in the short time he spent in the head coach’s office before a Fan Fest scrimmage Brian Daboll allowed himself to feel something he’d never felt in his football life.

That should be noted … just in case he becomes the next Tom Coughlin or Bill Parcells.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDQ0NTIwLW5ldy15b3JrLWpldHMtdG8td2Vhci11a3JhaW5lLWZsYWctaGVsbWV0LWRlY2Fscy1mb3Itd2Vlay0zLWdhbWUtdnMtYmVuZ2Fsc9IBiAFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwNDQ1MjAtbmV3LXlvcmstamV0cy10by13ZWFyLXVrcmFpbmUtZmxhZy1oZWxtZXQtZGVjYWxzLWZvci13ZWVrLTMtZ2FtZS12cy1iZW5nYWxzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Jets to Wear Ukraine Flag Helmet Decals for Week 3 Game vs. Bengals,"John Rivera/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

In an effort to raise awareness for relief efforts the New York Jets will wear Ukrainian flag decals on their helmets for their Week 3 home game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sept. 25.

According to NFL.com's Judy Battista the Jets will also paint a Ukrainian flag in each end zone at their home venue of MetLife Stadium for the Week 3 contest.

In addition to bringing attention to relief efforts the Jets are donating $1 million toward them with $100000 being given to 10 different organizations that are lending a helping hand in Ukraine.

Ukraine has been embroiled in conflict since February which is when neighboring Russia first invaded the country.

The invasion of Ukraine hits especially close to home for the Jets since Suzanne Johnson the wife of Jets owner Woody Johnson is the daughter of a Ukrainian immigrant.

Per Battista Johnson's father was a Ukrainian immigrant and her mother was a first-generation Ukrainian American and they lived in the Ukrainian portion of New York's Greenwich Village.

Regarding the decision to display the Ukrainian flag in prominent places during the Sept. 25 game against Cincinnati Johnson said:

""We have to keep awareness up. We're not doing anything political. We're only focusing on the humanitarian doing as much to help them until they can go back to their country to donate as much as we can and by our donating put it up on our website. It's all we can do.""

The Jets are coming off a 4-13 season and have missed the playoffs in each of the past 11 years but there is optimism surrounding the team in 2022.

New York selected potential instant-impact players such as wide receiver Garrett Wilson running back Breece Hall cornerback Sauce Gardner and defensive end Jermaine Johnson in the NFL draft.

Also 2022 will mark the second season of both quarterback Zach Wilson and head coach Robert Saleh at the helm meaning improvement is expected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5mbC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXBsYW4td2Vlay0zLXRyaWJ1dGUtdG8tdWtyYWluZS10by1yYWlzZS1hd2FyZW5lc3MtZm9yLXJlbGllZi1lZmZvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Jets plan Week 3 tribute to Ukraine to raise awareness for relief efforts,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5mbC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXBsYW4td2Vlay0zLXRyaWJ1dGUtdG8tdWtyYWluZS10by1yYWlzZS1hd2FyZW5lc3MtZm9yLXJlbGllZi1lZmZvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D8391F8B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5mbC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXBsYW4td2Vlay0zLXRyaWJ1dGUtdG8tdWtyYWluZS10by1yYWlzZS1hd2FyZW5lc3MtZm9yLXJlbGllZi1lZmZvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb2Zvb3RiYWxsbmV0d29yay5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmstZ2lhbnRzLXRyYWluaW5nLWNhbXAtZmFuZmVzdC1kYW5pZWwtam9uZXMta2F5dm9uLXRoaWJvZGVhdXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Giants training camp: Daniel Jones ebbs and flows Kayvon Thibodeaux continues to surge at FanFest,"EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. — The chemistry between New York Giants QB Daniel Jones and his newest weapon has been percolating in the Meadowlands. On Friday during the team’s annual FanFest practice at MetLife Stadium Jones struggled to find consistency as a passer but his connection with rookie wideout Wan’Dale Robinson remained one of the few bright spots in an otherwise mediocre two-week start for the offense at training camp.

New York Giants training camp: Daniel Jones uneven in front of a crowd at FanFest

Jones got off to a rough start during the first drive in front of fans. The QB completed just 4 of 11 passes for 45 yards during the initial series and the drive’s longevity only existed due to head coach Brian Daboll’s desire to see Jones receive a healthy workload.

Following a 2-yard run and a near-pick by Jones to start the drive cornerback Darnay Holmes blitzed with nothing but the QB and grass in front of him. In a game Holmes would have cleaned Jones’ clock but since there was no contact in the practice — especially for the QB — the refs let the play continue as Holmes essentially froze in front of Jones.

To his credit Jones left the pocket and made an excellent throw on the run to Robinson a second-round pick in April over the middle. From there Robinson took off on an angle and picked up a 28-yard gain on the catch-and-run.

The offense-oriented Daboll let Jones continue his work and even moved the ball in scenarios when the offense didn’t convert on fourth down. Jones’ other positive play was a 27-yard run for a touchdown in a non-contact practice.

Daboll moved the ball back to the 5-yard line after the run and the Giants failed to pick up a touchdown on four consecutive plays with Jones throwing off the mark on two of the four attempts. The fourth-down failure came on a jump ball for wideout Kenny Golladay who failed to get his feet inbounds in the end zone.

Jones recovered on the next drive leading the offense to a touchdown on the series. The QB completed 8 of 11 passes for 67 yards and a TD on the drive capping the series with a 1-yard scoring strike — on a rollout toss — to tight end Andre Miller. The highlight of the drive other than the TD was a 21-yard screen pass to RB Saquan Barkley. Jones did a nice job of timing the pass suckering in the defense and tossing the ball to Barkley with room to run.

While tracking training camp tosses can be about as fruitful as chasing ghosts for the sake of this workout — which played out like a scrimmage — Jones went 12 of 22 for 112 yards and a touchdown. It was a “stock even” night for the starting QB.

Kayvon Thibodeaux continues to impress at training camp

The Giants have to feel great about first-round pick Kayvon Thibodeaux through two weeks of training camp. He has routinely outmuscled offensive linemen with a mix of speed and power and his athleticism is off the charts. During the first two first-team drills on Friday Thibodeaux picked up a would-be sack (plays weren’t whistled dead throughout the night) and then forced a holding penalty on left tackle Andrew Thomas.

Thibodeaux the fifth overall pick in April routinely forced pressure on Jones throughout the stadium practice from the outside linebacker position. While there was no way to gauge the totality of his work without live physicality he looked the part in front of a decent turnout of fans.

Secondary looks swell on Friday night

On the second team rep of the practice No. 1 cornerback Adoree’ Jackson nearly picked off Jones on a comeback route by wideout Kadarius Toney. Jackson got both hands on the ball but failed to haul it in. That play was an indication of what was to come as the secondary produced multiple breakups against the offense.

A couple of series later cornerback Darren Evans made a great play with the deep-depth defense. He broke up a pass from third-string QB Davis Webb to wideout Darius Slayton down the field.

Then safety Julian Love was able to rip a ball out of Robinson’s hands after Jones hit him on the sideline to force an incompletion. Also cornerback Michael Jacquet and safety Yusef Corker combined for a breakup on wideout Collin Johnson when backup QB Tyrod Taylor tossed a deep ball to a “go” route.

Later on Webb targeted wideout Keelan Doss on a fade route and Evans tipped the jump ball to Corker who collected the pick. Corker got some great blocking in front of him as he came out of the end zone and returned the ball 55 yards to the opposing 45-yard line.

Cornerback Zyon Gilbert also made an impressive leaping pass breakup on a 15-yard toss from Webb to wideout Alex Bachman in the end zone.

Overall it was a good sign to see the entire secondary — from first- to third-team units — have its moments.

Injury updates

Rookie offensive lineman Marcus MeKethan suffered a leg injury during the second set of second-team drills. During a play that resulted in several flags being thrown MeKethan went down and held his leg as Taylor rolled out to his left for a deep ball that fell incomplete near the end zone. MeKethan a fifth-round pick in April was eventually carted off the field.

Center Nick Gates offensive tackle Matt Peart and wideout Sterling Shepard remained on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list and didn’t take part in the night practice. Linebacker Azeez Ojulari remained on the non-football injury (NFI) list.

Offensive lineman Matt Gono is on the exempt/left squad list. According to a league source Gono is dealing with a neck injury and is away from the team. He doesn’t count against the 90-man roster and he was replaced with the signing of offensive tackle Will Holden prior to FanFest. Holden is wearing No. 79 for the Giants.

Quick Hits from Giants FanFest

Webb did a nice job with a floater to Doss on a fade route. Davis beat Evans by a couple of steps and picked up roughly 20 yards on the play.

Taylor had a well-placed pass on a short TD score by wideout Richie James. Taylor has looked calm and collected in PFN’s viewings of him throughout the summer. At the very least Taylor can push Jones in camp and throughout the season with his credibility and experience.

Running back Matt Brieda has been on four different teams over the past four summers. The former undrafted running back spent time in San Franciso Miami and Buffalo before re-joining Daboll and GM Joe Schoen in the Meadowlands this offseason. This writer has attended two Giants practices during the first two weeks of camp and has come away impressed by Brieda who obviously has the advantage of knowing Daboll’s defense. He’s playing fast mentally and physically this summer.

Bachman had a couple of impressive catch-and-run plays with the deep-depth offensive units. He might have a shot of sticking around under a new regime.

The PFN’Training Camp Tour’s northeast leg will continue with a second night at MetLife Stadium as the New York Jets host their annual Green & White Scrimmage on Saturday night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbi1waWN0dXJlcy02MjM5ODQ1NtIBMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbi1waWN0dXJlcy02MjM5ODQ1Ni5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Sports Photography Awards 2022 winners revealed,

Mass production is expected to start in the first half of 2023.

About a week ago US-based leader in storage and memory Micron Technology Inc announced that it has started working on the industry’s first 232-layer triple-level cell (TLC) NAND flash memory chip. Not too long after South Korea’s memory chip giant SK hynix unveiled that they will be offering the world’s highest 238-Layer NAND Flash design based on 4D layering that can be used for PC storage devices and later on smartphones and servers.

SK Hynic also the world’s second-largest memory chip maker said that the 238-layer NAND Flash product is expected to enter production by the first half of 2023. The company described it as the “industry’s highest” NAND flash chip challenging its US rival Micron who had begun shipping a 232-layer NAND chip.

SK Hynix said the new 238-layer chip is the smallest NAND flash chip in size boasts a 50% improvement in data transfer speed over previous generation chips and power efficiency as well as it cuts the volume of energy consumed for data reading by 21%. The company has in fact shipped samples of those 238-layer 512Gb TLC 4D NAND products to customers with plans to start mass production in the first half of 2023.

For context NAND Flash products are categorized into Single Level Cell Multi Level Cell Triple Level Cell Quadruple Level Cell and Penta Level Cell depending on the number of information (unit: bit) contained in a single cell. That a cell contains more information means more data can be stored within the same extent of the area.

Since the development of the 96-layer NAND product in 2018 SK Hynix has introduced a series of 4D products that outperform existing 3D products. The company has applied charge trap flash and peri under cell technologies to make chips with 4D structures. 4D products have a smaller cell area per unit compared with 3D leading to higher production efficiency.

“The latest achievement follows the development of the 176-layer NAND product in December 2020” the company stated. “It is notable that the latest 238-layer product is the most layered and smallest in the area at the same time.” The company unveiled the development of the latest product at the Flash Memory Summit 2022* in Santa Clara.

SK Hynix’s head of NAND development Jungdal Choi in his keynote speech during the event said “SK Hynix secured global top-tier competitiveness in perspective of cost performance and quality by introducing the 238-layer product based on its 4D NAND technologies/ We will continue innovations to find breakthroughs in technological challenges.”

The smallest computer Apple sells has a 13.3-inch screen. Dell’s tiniest XPS comes with a 13.4-inch panel. HP’s Spectre X360 line scales down to 13.5-inch screens which the company lists as a 14-inch class. The 11- or 12-inch laptops you can buy (the ones that aren’t tablets trying to masquerade as something else) are typically cheap and slow. Modern laptops have trimmed weights and bezels and frames considerably making it easier to tote around those 13-inch or larger screens finding a premium consumer laptop with 12-inch or smaller screen for the ultimate in portability is a challenge.

That’s where Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Go 2 comes in. The least expensive laptop Microsoft sells (not counting the education-only Laptop SE) the $599-and-up Laptop Go 2 is also the smallest and lightest with a 12.4-inch screen and weight of just under two and a half pounds. But it maintains the Surface design aesthetic and features including a comfortable keyboard clear speakers and microphones a smooth trackpad and 3:2 aspect ratio.

Of course that portability doesn’t come without compromise. The Go 2 doesn’t have the range of processor RAM and storage options of larger laptops sticking with an 11th Gen Core i5 processor and maxing out at 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Battery life doesn’t even reach half a day of work for me. This isn’t a computer for heavy demanding workloads (and certainly not gamers or those doing creative visual work). It’s meant for someone who just needs to stay on top of email compose some documents and browse the web and wants a small light on-the-go machine. After all it’s right in the name.

The Surface Laptop Go 2 maintains Microsoft’s minimalist Surface aesthetic: its squared-off wedge shape is identical to the first-generation Go from 2020 or a slightly shrunken-down Surface Laptop 4. This time around you can get it in a sage green in addition to the light blue gold or silver options. My review unit has this green color and it’s quite nice. I’m not mad that this year’s green phone trend is bleeding over to laptops now.

Though this is Microsoft’s least expensive laptop it doesn’t look or feel like a cheap computer with tight tolerances lack of chassis flex and a stiff hinge with perfect one-finger opening. (The lack of tacky stickers on the deck is also rare in this price range.) Like the larger Surface computers the Go 2 has an aluminum lid and deck — though Microsoft does use a plastic panel on the bottom instead of aluminum like the Surface Laptop 4 it never once had a negative impact on my experience. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a nicer-feeling computer in this price range.

The Laptop Go 2 has the same port selection as its predecessor which is to say it’s kinda lousy. There’s a single USB-A port a single USB-C port (not Thunderbolt sadly) a 3.5mm headphone jack and Microsoft’s magnetic Surface Connect port for charging and docking. You can use that USB-C to connect to external displays or charge the device but you won’t get the benefits of superfast data transfer that Thunderbolt brings. Microsoft’s larger Surface Laptops are similarly port-limited so this isn’t a surprise but another couple USB ports here would really let you leave the dongle life behind.

Ports are limited to use one USB-C one USB-A and one 3.5mm headphone jack. The right side of the computer has Microsoft’s proprietary Surface Connect port.

The screen on the Laptop Go 2 is also unchanged from its predecessor — a 12.5-inch 3:2 1536 x 1024 touch panel. It’s not the brightest or most pixel-dense screen you can get but in my testing peak brightness hit a respectable 360 nits which is enough to let me use the laptop outdoors under an umbrella without much issue. In normal indoor situations comfortable brightness (about 200 nits) was around 70 percent on the slider. (One aside: if you do plan to use the Go 2 outdoors you might want to leave the polarized sunglasses at home. The polarization on the screen means the display was black when I wore my sunglasses unless I rotated the computer 90 degrees. I do not have this issue with MacBooks and the same sunglasses so it’s possibly something Microsoft could fix for next time.) Touch response on the screen is right in line with expectations though it is not compatible with Microsoft’s Surface Pens for stylus input.

Like other Surface computers the Go 2’s screen is well-calibrated and color-accurate out of the box. It covers 99 percent of the sRGB spectrum 74 percent of AdobeRGB and 76 percent of P3 according to my colorimeter which means it could be used for photo editing work without much issue. But most people buying this computer will just appreciate the screen’s pleasing colors and contrast and lack of color shifting or ghosting. They will also appreciate the 3:2 aspect ratio which provides more vertical real estate than the typical 16:9 screens you get in this price range ideal for web browsing and document work.

The Laptop Go 2 has an excellent keyboard despite the laptop’s smaller dimensions with well-spaced keys comfortable travel and quiet feedback. My only real complaint is the lack of keyboard backlight which should be non-negotiable at this price and is found on many other popular laptops in this price range. The trackpad is smaller than you’ll find on a modern MacBook or XPS laptop but it works perfectly fine for tracking scrolling and other multifinger gestures and I had no issues with palm rejection.

The Laptop Go 2’s keyboard and trackpad are excellent. But bafflingly it lacks any keyboard backlighting. There’s a fingerprint scanner on certain configurations that makes logging in to Windows a breeze.

The power button in the upper-right-hand corner of the keyboard has an integrated fingerprint scanner for Windows Hello authentication (on upgraded tiers not the base model). More expensive Surface computers use facial recognition cameras but the fingerprint sensor is quick and easy to use; I didn’t miss facial recognition at all. There’s even a little light around the scanner to help you find it easily when you open the lid.

Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2 accessibility The keyboard’s keys are dark with white legends. There is no backlighting.

The laptop weighs 2.48 pounds.

Ports include one USB-C one USB-A 3.5mm headphone jack Microsoft Surface Connect

The lid can be opened with one hand

The screen is 12.5 inches with a 1536 x 1024 resolution. It reached 356 nits of brightness in testing. All configurations include touch support.

The touchpad supports precision gestures.

Setup involves turning the device on and clicking through several menus.

Fingerprint login is supported. Windows 11 Windows 11 includes a dedicated accessibility menu.

Windows 11 includes a built-in screen reader (Narrator). It supports third-party screen readers including NVDA from NV Access and Jaws from Freedom Scientific. A full list of compatible software can be found on Microsoft’s website.

Windows 11 supports voice typing (accessed by Windows + H) and speech recognition (toggled with Windows + Ctrl + S).

Color Filters including inverted grayscale red-green and blue-yellow can be toggled with Windows + Ctrl + C. Contrast themes are toggled with Alt + Left Shift + Print Screen. Standard Dark Mode and custom colors are also available under Personalization.

Caption color and size can be customized and appear close to the bottom of the screen.

The keyboard can be remapped with Microsoft’s PowerToys. Sticky Keys is supported. An on-screen keyboard is available.

The cursor’s size and speed can be adjusted and gestures can be remapped in Touchpad Settings.

Windows 11 supports eye control with external eye trackers.

Windows 11 includes a Snap Layout feature accessed by hovering over the Maximize button on any open window.

The camera uses a 720p sensor instead of the 1080p one found in other Surface computers. It’s not stunning by any means but it isn’t the worst either with sharper images and more detail than Dell’s XPS cameras or the 720p camera on Apple’s latest 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro. It’s flanked by two microphones that along with the Laptop Go 2’s speakers under the keyboard deck provide clear video call audio.

All Surface Laptop Go 2 models have the same Core i5-1135G7 quad-core processor inside. It’s a capable chip and had no issues handling my typical workload of dozens of browser tabs Slack Twitter email Zoom and other work apps spread across multiple virtual desktops. It is not however useful for AAA gaming or creative work. For fun I ran the PugetBench benchmark for Adobe Premiere Pro that we use to evaluate more powerful laptops and it scored a 155. We typically see scores in the 700 and up range in laptops that have discrete graphics cards and more powerful processors. Don’t buy this if you plan on editing 4K video; this isn’t the laptop for you.

The $599 base configuration comes with just 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage which isn’t enough. My $799 review unit has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; that’s the only model I recommend buying. Any less RAM or storage and you’ll run into performance issues or storage problems relatively soon. That price is $100 less than a similarly equipped first-gen Surface Laptop Go but it’s still far from cheap. (As of this writing both Microsoft and Best Buy have discounted the range from $40 to $100 which means you can get a top spec one for about $700. That’s not a bad deal.)

Despite its small size and weight the Laptop Go 2 is not a fanless computer and its small fan is audible and often annoying. My first review sample had a clicking sound when the fan was at a low speed (which it frequently spins at) that was quite irritating while in a quiet room. A replacement didn’t have that problem so it’s possible it’s limited to that specific unit. Higher fan speeds present a more common whooshing sound but I typically only heard those when in Zoom calls or running benchmark tests. The bottom of the laptop also gets warm but the deck and palm rests remain comfortably cool.

Battery life is perhaps the biggest problem I have with the Surface Laptop Go 2 however. With my standard workload and the screen set to about 200 nits I averaged less than five hours of use between charges. Many days I had to plug in before noon to ensure it didn’t die in the middle of a meeting or working on a document. I have the uncanny ability to kill laptop batteries faster than a lot of my colleagues but many 13-inch laptops can easily last twice as long with my workload so you really have to value the slightly smaller size and lighter weight to accept this kind of battery performance.

Between the fan noise noticeable heat and lousy battery life I wish Microsoft had just used an Arm-based processor in this computer. Plenty of Arm chips like what’s in the Surface Pro X Apple’s latest computers and a few Chromebooks have enough power to match the usage profile of a computer like this plus run cooler don’t need fans and have much better battery life. Windows 11 continues to get better with Arm too and this feels like the right kind of computer to leverage that.

The Laptop Go 2 has the same design aesthetics as Microsoft’s larger and more expensive laptops.

During my entire time using the Surface Laptop Go 2 I was reminded of Apple’s 11-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook from 2015. Both of those were high-end small computers that were designed to be as light and portable as possible while still providing excellent keyboards trackpads and capabilities. They also had compromises when it came to battery life and power (and ports).

The Surface Laptop Go 2 feels like a modern version of those compact laptops complete with many of the same limitations. It’s too expensive to be a real budget option not powerful enough to be for demanding users and doesn’t have the battery life to last all day away from an outlet. You can pay less money and get more performance battery life and computer from a Chromebook or even another Windows laptop.

What the Laptop Go 2 is though is a small lightweight computer with a comfortable keyboard trackpad and screen wrapped in a nice-looking and -feeling package. It also comes with a real processor and enough RAM and storage to do real work unlike other subcompact computers. If those are the specific things you value and are looking for in a laptop well… the Surface Laptop Go 2 is basically your only option right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwYWZiLmFmLm1pbC9OZXdzL0FydGljbGUtRGlzcGxheS9BcnRpY2xlLzMxMTcyMDcvYWZuZXQtcHVzaGVzLXVwZGF0ZS10by1vZmZpY2UtMzY1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AFNET pushes update to Office 365,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwYWZiLmFmLm1pbC9OZXdzL0FydGljbGUtRGlzcGxheS9BcnRpY2xlLzMxMTcyMDcvYWZuZXQtcHVzaGVzLXVwZGF0ZS10by1vZmZpY2UtMzY1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82950D30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwYWZiLmFmLm1pbC9OZXdzL0FydGljbGUtRGlzcGxheS9BcnRpY2xlLzMxMTcyMDcvYWZuZXQtcHVzaGVzLXVwZGF0ZS10by1vZmZpY2UtMzY1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtZ2l2ZXMtZ3JhbnQtdG8tYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1iYXNlZC13ZWIzLWdhbWUtc3Rhcmhlcm9lcy1hcy1oaXN0b3JpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1nZXRzLXVuZGVyd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Gives Grant To Blockchain-Based Web3 Game StarHeroes As Historic Partnership Gets Underway – Press ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtZ2l2ZXMtZ3JhbnQtdG8tYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1iYXNlZC13ZWIzLWdhbWUtc3Rhcmhlcm9lcy1hcy1oaXN0b3JpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1nZXRzLXVuZGVyd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D849176D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtZ2l2ZXMtZ3JhbnQtdG8tYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1iYXNlZC13ZWIzLWdhbWUtc3Rhcmhlcm9lcy1hcy1oaXN0b3JpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1nZXRzLXVuZGVyd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Many redeveloped RV parks are home to lovely tiny house communities and some small towns are embracing tiny homes as a way to spur population growth. Several communities are even using tiny houses as a solution for homelesness. Below are 15 tiny home communities that are currently thriving in the United States.

Is that common?,"DEAR DR. ROACH: My initial two COVID-19 shots and first booster were from Moderna. After reading your column I chose Pfizer for my second booster. Now I have hives which never happened with Moderna. Why is this? Have you heard of other cases of hives caused by the Pfizer vaccine? -- M.S.

ANSWER: Yes both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine like other vaccines can cause a mild allergic reaction occasionally and a severe reaction rarely. The timing of the hives is important. Hives that begin within 15 minutes of the injection are much more concerning and likely to represent a serious allergic reaction. If hives are combined with wheezing or low blood pressure that would be very serious and likely prevent you from getting another vaccine (of course speak to your doctor about this). By contrast hives that come hours or days after the injection do not mean you are unable to get further vaccines.

Why you had a reaction to the Pfizer and not the Moderna is unclear. The vaccines are very similar but there must be something in the Pfizer your system reacts to.

DEAR DR. ROACH: For sleep my boyfriend (78) takes Ambien when he needs it a few times each week. The instructions on the bottle says “take as needed.” To me that means if he doesn’t need it he doesn’t take it. That’s simple logic.

His doctor occasionally will order a urine drug screen looking for metabolites of Ambien -- something about their office policy which I do not quite understand. Recently the screen showed no presence of the drug and the doctor was bothered by this. He admonished my boyfriend for not taking the medication which I found odd. I’m not sure if that precipitated the next thing: The insurance company denied the claim (for the drug test) indicating it had not been preauthorized. Now he is faced with a $138 bill for a drug test he did not need. Would you care to comment? -- D.U.

ANSWER: I don’t understand your boyfriend’s doctor’s decision. You are quite right that “as needed” means he takes it only when he needs it. In fact for zolpidem (Ambien) in particular the less often my patients need it the happier I am. Ambien increases risk of both falling and motor vehicle accidents. Checking a level for Ambien in this context makes no sense. The only circumstance I can think of is checking in a person who is addicted to it by an addiction specialist looking for surreptitious use.

There are some times that checking a drug level does make sense. In a person on long-term opiate treatment for example some physicians will periodically make sure they are taking the medication and not “diverting” it -- a term meaning rather than using it they are selling it or trading it for other drugs. Testing only makes sense if a person needs and is supposed to be taking medication continuously.

I fear that blaming “office policy” is either laziness or an attempt to deflect responsibility. Your boyfriend would be right to contest the bill which was medically unnecessary. I’d even recommend he consider a different doctor.

The company said that its Spikevax vaccine brought in USD4.53 billion during the quarter.

Analysts were looking for around USD3.6 billion according to FactSet.

Moderna shares surged on Wednesday after the company also announced another USD3 billion share buyback plan.

Moderna’s vaccine sales in the second quarter represent a drop from the nearly USD6 billion that the vaccine brought in during the year’s first quarter when a virus surge through the United States (US) pushed more people to seek protection.

But those sales could pick up again later this year.

Moderna has developed an updated version of its vaccine for a fall booster campaign that combines the original shot with protection against the Omicron variant.

The company announced last week that it reached a deal with the US government for an initial purchase of 66 million doses of the booster shot for up to USD1.74 billion. The government also has an option to purchase more doses.

The COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna’s main source of revenue outside of grants and money from collaborations. Total revenue climbed nine per cent in the second quarter to USD4.75 billion.

But operating expenses also swelled 78 per cent to USD2.3 billion for the vaccine maker which has several products in late-stage clinical trials the most expensive phase of research.

Moderna had USD499 million in inventory write-downs in the quarter tied to vaccine doses that exceeded or were expected to exceed their shelf lives before being used. The company also said it booked another loss and an expense for unused manufacturing capacity due partly to a “substantial reduction” in expected deliveries to the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme.

Overall net income plunged 21 per cent to USD2.2 billion in the second quarter and earnings totalled USD5.24 per share.",,,,,,,,,

Mohawk Industries Inc. notified labor officials this week about its decision to shut down its Oak River campus in Bennettsville on Oct. 6 in what is one of the largest mass layoffs in the Palmetto State this year.

The work is being moved from the Pee Dee town of about 8000 residents to one of the company's factories in northwest Georgia.

The pullout could nearly double Marlboro's jobless rate already the highest in South Carolina at 7.1 percent as of June according to the latest figures.

News archives show the original yarn-spinning and wool-scouring mill at Oak River was completed in 1957 by Mohawk predecessor Mohasco Industries to supply the New York-based company's carpet business. Two more factories were built later.

Curt Hutchins president of Mohawk’s residential carpet business said in a statement that longtime employees ""have seen many changes"" since the 1990s that ""were part of ongoing efforts to extend the operations on this campus and to invest in the Bennettsville community.”

“Oak River continued to operate for almost thirty years after the closure of the carpet plant it was built to support. That speaks to the commitment to excellence of the people at this plant"" Hutchins said. ""However during that same time period we have also seen significant changes in consumer fiber preferences and manufacturing technology advances both of which have ultimately directed this business decision.”

Last week while discussing financial results Mohawk CEO Jeffrey Lorberbaum said the Calhoun Ga.-based company was feeling the impact of widespread inflation the housing market slowdown and the pullback in consumer spending for luxury purchases like new carpeting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueWJqLmNvbS9mb29kLXRydWNrcy1ldmVudHMtYnJpbmctbW9iaWxlLWZlYXN0cy10by1tb2hhd2stdmFsbGV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food trucks events bring mobile feasts to Mohawk Valley,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnybj.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /food-trucks-events-bring-mobile-feasts-to-mohawk-valley/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84916FE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueWJqLmNvbS9mb29kLXRydWNrcy1ldmVudHMtYnJpbmctbW9iaWxlLWZlYXN0cy10by1tb2hhd2stdmFsbGV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueWJqLmNvbS93b2xmc3BlZWQtaGlyaW5nLWlzLWFoZWFkLW9mLXNjaGVkdWxlLWF0LW1vaGF3ay12YWxsZXktZmFiL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wolfspeed hiring is ahead of schedule at Mohawk Valley Fab,"A clean room at Wolfspeed’s 200mm silicon-carbide fabrication facility at the Marcy Nanocenter. (PHOTO CREDIT: HEATHER AINSWORTH PHOTOGRAPHY)

MARCY — Just a few months after a high-tech grand opening that involved a ribbon cutting by an electric vehicle things are ramping up so fast at Wolfspeed that the company is already ahead of its employment projections.

The 200mm silicon-carbide fabrication facility opened at the Marcy Nanocenter in April. Headquartered in North Carolina Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) produces silicon-carbide wafers for components used in devices such as electric vehicles fast chargers 5G applications and the renewable energy aerospace and defense industries.

At the time of the grand opening Wolfspeed had 265 employees with the plant running at 10 percent of its full capacity. At the time the company predicted it would reach 270 employees by early 2023 but it has already reached and surpassed that benchmark nearly six months ahead of schedule.

At press time Adam Milton VP of the Mohawk Valley Fab facility confirmed to CNYBJ that Wolfspeed recently hired its 300th employee and is still hiring.

The company has continued to add both equipment and employees since its grand opening as it ramps up to full speed he says. Currently Wolfspeed is working on preparing equipment for a process known as qualification which ensures the equipment produces materials to the correct specifications.

“We have to meet all the customer specifications” Milton adds. To date Wolfspeed has announced both General Motors and Lucid Motors as major customers of the silicon-carbide chips produced there.

Milton says he expects them to be the first of many customers as interest in U.S.-produced chips continues to grow especially after the chip shortage experienced during the pandemic that led to shortages of cars and other products.

Wolfspeed’s silicon-carbide chips provide an efficiency boost of anywhere from 5 to 15 percent over traditional chips. “You can imagine all the main players ... are looking very closely at silicon carbide and working with Wolfspeed” Milton contends.

Those companies want a domestic chip supplier than can guarantee a steady supply he says. “It’s a great position to be in right now with this factory coming online.”

As business increases so will the need for employees and Ashley Evans manager of talent acquisition for Wolfspeed continues to actively recruit new employees.

“I have staffed this thing from the ground up” she says of the Mohawk Valley Fab. The company is about halfway to its total staffing goal of 600 employees by the end of 2029. “It’s just a testament to the local talent up there and the excitement over Wolfspeed” Evans says.

The majority of jobs at the plant are technical including equipment technicians process technicians and manufacturing technicians. “We’re also hiring engineers” Evans adds. In addition the factory employs IT and facilities workers as well as other shared-services employees.

Evans is currently recruiting for about 60 open positions with more jobs added by the day. New York residents fill a majority of the technician positions while the salaried workforce tends to come from a wider geographic area due to the specialized skillsets required.

Wolfspeed already partners closely with nearby SUNY Polytechnic Institute to provide training for students whom it hopes to recruit as employees upon graduation.

“We want to hire locally” Evans stresses. “We want to bring the students in to work right in their backyard.”",,,,,,

For the five national companies with the largest Medicaid managed care businesses the past two- and one-half years have been a period of particularly robust growth. Since PHE Q1 which ended on March 31 2020 enrollment in Medicaid managed care organizations grew by 38.3 percent from 30.1 million to 41.6 million (Figure 1). And for the three companies for which information is available—Centene Molina and UnitedHealth Group—Medicaid revenues increased by 40 percent from $31.8 billion to $44.4 billion.

After each quarter publicly traded companies file earnings reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Table 1 which is based in part on these earnings reports summarizes Medicaid enrollment and where available Medicaid revenue growth by company.

Some highlights:

Centene operates the most MCOs (33) per the KFF Medicaid Managed Care Market Tracker and has by far the highest Medicaid enrollment (15.4 million). In PHE Q10 (2022 Q2) Centene’s Medicaid enrollment accounted for nearly three-fifths of its total enrollment. Since PHE Q1 Centene’s Medicaid enrollment has increased by 3.6 million (30.8 percent) and its Medicaid revenues have grown by $5.4 billion (31.8 percent). According to the Fortune 500 list Centene is the 26 th largest company in the U.S. (just behind General Motors).

largest company in the U.S. (just behind General Motors). CVS Health is the fourth largest U.S. company in 2022 behind Walmart Amazon and Apple but it has the smallest Medicaid footprint of the Big Five. Its health insurer Aetna had a Medicaid enrollment of 2.4 million in 15 states. Since PHE Q1 that enrollment has grown by 590000 or 32.2 percent.

Elevance Health (the company formerly known as Anthem) has the second largest Medicaid enrollment among the Big Five 11.2 million. These enrollees account for 23.8 percent of total Elevance Health enrollment across all product lines. Since PHE Q1 Elevance’s Medicaid enrollment has grown by 3.6 million or 46.8 percent. Elevance did not provide revenue data for its Medicaid line of business. Elevance Health ranks as no. 20 on the Fortune 500 list of largest U.S. companies.

Molina is the smallest of the Big Five as measured by revenues but it nonetheless ranks 125 th on the Fortune 500 list for 2022. Molina’s Medicaid enrollment accounted for 90.1 percent of its total enrollment this quarter. Since PHE Q1 Molina’s Medicaid enrollment has grown by 1.6 million or 55.2 percent the largest Medicaid growth rate among the Big Five. Medicaid revenues are up 3.0 billion or 91.8 percent since PHE Q1.

on the Fortune 500 list for 2022. Molina’s Medicaid enrollment accounted for 90.1 percent of its total enrollment this quarter. Since PHE Q1 Molina’s Medicaid enrollment has grown by 1.6 million or 55.2 percent the largest Medicaid growth rate among the Big Five. Medicaid revenues are up 3.0 billion or 91.8 percent since PHE Q1. UnitedHealth Group (UHG)’s revenues made it the fifth largest Fortune 500 company in 2022 right behind CVS Health. In PHE Q10 UHG’s Medicaid revenues accounted for nearly one fifth of its total revenues (19.5 percent). Since PHE Q1 its Medicaid enrollment has grown by 2.1 million or 35.9 percent and its Medicaid revenues have increased by $4.2 billion or 36.8 percent.

There’s a reason that these companies which have other lines of business (e.g. employer group insurance Medicare Advantage and the Marketplace) are competing in the Medicaid market: it’s lucrative. Just how lucrative? Actuaries at Milliman recently issued their annual analysis of the financial results for Medicaid MCOs during 2021. Based on a sample of 188 MCOs (these included subsidiaries of the “Big Five” but were not limited to them) the actuaries calculated that the MCOs “recorded $245.3 billion in revenue and achieved composite underwriting gains of 3.5%....” These numbers the actuaries said were “the highest MCO composite totals in the [14-year] history of this analysis.” Underwriting gains are “the proportion of revenues that [is] ‘left over’ to fund the MCO’s contribution to surplus and profit after funding medical and administrative expenses.” An underwriting gain of 3.5 percent on $245 billion translates into $8.6 billion (with a “b”).

The Milliman actuaries predict that when the PHE ends “Medicaid managed care programs will again experience a major disruption as members are disenrolled from Medicaid programs.” No one can be certain when the PHE will end. What we do know is that on July 15 HHS Secretary Becerra extended the PHE for another ninety days to October 13 2022. We also know that the financial analysts who follow publicly traded companies for investors have more than a passing interest in how the Big Five will manage the “major disruption.”

The unwinding won’t just be the largest enrollment event in Medicaid’s history—one that puts the coverage of children and families at risk—it also has the potential to redistribute Medicaid market share both nationally among the Big Five as well as at the state level between their subsidiaries and other MCOs. Whether this is good for children and families who remain enrolled in Medicaid once the PHE unwinding dust settles is an open question since there’s so little transparency about individual MCO performance. In any event CMS has been encouraging state agencies to among other things work with MCOs to update the contact information of enrollees (do you know where your enrollees are?) and to reach out to them to provide assistance with the renewal process during the redetermination period.

For their part the Big Five have their talking points down:

Centene: “…the PHE may be extended beyond October 2022. Our Ambetter [Marketplace] product covers the majority of our Medicaid states and we believe we are among the best positioned in the healthcare market to capture those transitioning coverage through redeterminations. Our execution plan is well-thought out and we remain agile in working with our state partners and are prepared to support our members and promote continuity of coverage when redeterminations resume.”

CVS Health: “We're assuming obviously that the redeterminations really won't happen until next year of any kind of magnitude obviously with the extension of the PHE assumption in our guidance. We estimate we've added about 400000 to 500000 members as a result of that […] I put a caveat it's a difficult thing to estimate on the retention side but we might retain 25% plus or minus of that membership. Obviously our individual exchange footprint is expanding but still limited in the scope of our overall Medicaid block. So some of that will help but still obviously a lot to play out.”

Elevance Health: “Recertifications could begin as early as November 2022 but may not occur until 2023 in certain states and we expect a decline in our Medicaid membership once recertification resumes. At the same time we expect growth in our Commercial risk-based and fee-based plans including through the Public Exchange as members exiting Medicaid in our fourteen Commercial states seek coverage elsewhere.”

Molina: “…we added over 750000 new Medicaid members since March 31 2020 when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. We believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for Medicaid eligibility. We expect Medicaid enrollment to continue to benefit from the extension of the PHE period and the associated pause on membership redeterminations at least through mid-October 2022.”

UnitedHealth Group: “At this point we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year. We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs.”

There are few issues on which the interests of beneficiaries and those of MCOs are perfectly aligned. Reducing the “major disruption” that the PHE unwinding may bring to Medicaid enrollment is one of them. If state Medicaid agencies don’t execute properly then eligible individuals will lose coverage for procedural reasons and MCOs will lose enrollees who are in fact eligible. In the Q2 earnings calls some corporate officials stressed that they were in ongoing communication with state officials and monitoring key statistics like ex parte renewal rates. Advocates should seize the opportunity to join with MCOs in working with state Medicaid agencies to mitigate the disenrollment of eligible individuals for procedural reasons. A good starting point would be more transparency so that both advocates and MCOs could monitor trends in real time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnphY2tzLmNvbS9zdG9jay9uZXdzLzE5NjQ5MTQvbXlyaWFkLWdlbmV0aWNzLW15Z24tcTItZWFybmluZ3MtdG9wLWdyb3NzLW1hcmdpbi1kb3du0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuemFja3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9jay9uZXdzLzE5NjQ5MTQvbXlyaWFkLWdlbmV0aWNzLW15Z24tcTItZWFybmluZ3MtdG9wLWdyb3NzLW1hcmdpbi1kb3du?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Myriad Genetics (MYGN) Q2 Earnings Top Gross Margin Down,"This page has not been authorized sponsored or otherwise approved or endorsed by the companies represented herein.

TAP,Molson Coors Beverage Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tb2xzb24tY29vcnMtZ3Jvd2luZy1tYXJrZXQtc2hhcmUtMjA0MjA2OTk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molson Coors Is Growing Market Share Despite Cost Issues,"For over two centuries Molson Coors Beverage Co. (NYSE:TAP) has been making beer and other alcoholic beverages. The first Coors brewery location in Golden Colorado is actually the largest single brewing facility operating in the world. Brands that the company operates under include Coors Light Miller Lite Molson Canadian Carling Staropramen Coors Banquet Blue Moon Belgian White Blue Moon LightSky Vizzy Leinenkugels Summer Shandy and Creemore Springs.





Molson Coors is the fifth-largest beer company in the world with over $10 billion in revenue and currently sells beverages in over 100 countries.

Business

In the U.S. beer is distributed through a complex three-tier system consisting of manufacturers distributors and retailers. A national network of approximately 350 independent distributors and one company-owned distributor Coors Distributing Company purchases the company's products and distributes them to on and off-premise retail accounts. Coors Distributing Company distributed approximately 2% of total owned and non-owned Americans segment volume in 2021. Transportation of product to distributors in the U.S. is primarily contracted through third-party logistics providers and shipped by truckload.

Another interesting statistic is that 13% of revenue is derived from on-premise sales which means bars and restaurants. Another 87% of revenue is derived from off-premise sales which means grocery stores convenience stores liquor stores and other retail outlets. Also beer represents roughly half of all alcohol beverage sales in North America with wine and spirits making up the other half.

Financial review

Molson Coors reported second-quarter results this week which show constant currency revenue growth of 2.2% with particular strength in international markets. Domestic volume sales decreased 8.2% largely due to extraordinary items which are not expected to recur.

Cost of goods sold increased 11.5% due to higher input costs and ongoing supply chain issues that are affecting most companies in North America. As a result gross margins declined to 23.4% from 35.7% in the prior-year period. Pre-tax income declined 22.8% to $328.1 million.

The company had $442 million in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet and $6.8 billion in total debt outstanding. The company reaffirmed its target to reduce its leverage ratio be below 3 by the end of 2022.

Molson Coors Is Growing Market Share Despite Cost Issues

Valuation

The companys 2022 guidance called for mid-single-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis and high-single-digit growth in pre-tax income. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1 billion for the year.

Analyst consensus earnings per share estimates are $3.88 for this year and $4.24 for 2023. That puts the company selling at 14 times this year's earnings and 12 times next year's estimates which assumes a tamer inflationary environment. The company is selling at a enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of approximately 11 times based on 2022 estimates.

Using the GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculation with earnings per share of $3.88 as the starting point and 8% long-term growth creates a value of $65 or approximately 18% higher than the current price. Molson Coors pays an annualized dividend of $1.52 which equates to a dividend yield of 2.80% at this time.

Gurutrades

Gurus who have purchased Molson Coors stock recently include Charles Brandes (Trades Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades Portfolio)'s Bridgewater Associates. Gurus who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Diamond Hill Capital (Trades Portfolio) and John Rogers (Trades Portfolio).

Conclusion

The companys market share is increasing in core categories and brands such as Coors Light Miller Lite and Coors Banquet. Molson Canadian is growing share of the total beer industry for the first time in eight years. The company also has the fastest-growing hard seltzer brand in the industry with Topo Chico.

Alcohol beverage companies tend to be recession proof and in some cases even counter-cyclical such as during the Covid-19 pandemic downturn. Molson Coors may be a solid defensive holding if the recessionary environment we are in now continues into next year.

It will be the energy drink brand’s first new alcoholic beverage since the beverage maker acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in early 2022.

Beast Unleashed will come in a 16-ounce single serve can as well as a 12-can variety pack in 12-ounce cans. The four flavors will be based on some of the brand’s “most well known and popular flavors” Monster CEO and chairman Rodney Sacks said during the call.

“Beast unleashed will leverage Monster’s brand equity while carving out its own unique space in the beverage alcohol sector and will be distinguishable from the many hot seltzer brands that have become so ubiquitous over the last several years.”

Sacks said that the company’s alcohol innovation pipeline is “robust with a number of additional innovative product lines currently under development.”

Hilton H Schlosberg vice chairman and co-chief executive officer of Monster Beverage Corporation said ""We are pleased to report continued strong revenue growth driven by consumer demand. Ensuring product availability for our customers and consumers remains a priority.

""Following many quarters of supply chain challenges we have been able to rebuild inventories on a global basis while at the same time meeting strong customer demand despite operating in an extremely challenging unprecedented and costly supply chain environment.""

Divisional Performance

The company’s energy drinks segment saw sales increasing by 12.5% year on year to $1.54 billion (€1.5 billion) from $1.37 billion in the second quarter of 2021.

The energy drinks segment includes Monster Energy drinks Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks and True North Pure Energy Seltzer.

Net sales in the company’s strategic brands segment which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company as well as the company’s affordable energy brands decreased 9.0% year-on-year to $79.1 million.

In the alcohol-based drinks segment comprising various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on 17 February 2022 net sales amounted to $32.4 million.

The company’s other segment which includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company sold to independent third-party customers decreased to $6.0 million.

Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 18.8% to $649.0 million during the quarter and accounted for approximately 39% of total net sales.

Increased Cost Of Sales

In the second quarter of 2022 Monster experienced a significant increase in cost of sales resulting in a material decline in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales compared to the same period last year.

Schlosberg added ""Significant increases in freight-in and fuel costs including costs relating to the importation of aluminium cans as well as other input costs continue to impact costs of sales. We believe that some of the increased costs that we are experiencing are likely to be transitory as we begin to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminium cans as well as increase our inventory levels in closer proximity to our customers.

""Furthermore the sharp run-up in aluminium commodity pricing appears to be currently moderating. Increases in distribution costs particularly freight and fuel continued to adversely impact operating expenses.""

In the US the company will implement a market-wide increase in pricing from 1 September.

""We have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of increased costs experienced in our supply chain through reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and in EMEA. [...] In certain international markets price increases will also be implemented in the second half of 2022 some in addition to price increases or pricing actions already taken earlier in 2022"" Schlosberg continued.

She had enrolled at Duke University as an electrical and computer engineering major but kept busy with a variety of extracurricular activities including a stint programming for a big tech company and volunteering as a middle-school math teacher in New Orleans for a summer.

A career in finance wasn’t on her radar but after a friend suggested she attend an educational event featuring an interactive simulation of life on a sales and trading desk things started clicking into place. “It was a super fun hour” says Lee. “I was trying to make all these trades and watching news about the market at the same time—it was so fast-paced. I knew it was something I wanted to try.”

After her session Lee was one of a handful of participants who was fast-tracked for a Summer Analyst position with Morgan Stanley and when she graduates this summer she’ll join the firm’s Equity Sales and Trading division full-time.

That’s just the kind of outcome Morgan Stanley and AmplifyME are hoping to achieve with an ambitious new partnership. Working together the two firms aim to offer more than 100000 students the chance to participate at no cost in a sales and trading simulation at universities across North America Asia-Pacific and Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). The program kicked off in January in the UK and will continue to roll out across various regions over the course of the year.

That rollout will include more than 1000 campus events with the goal of reaching a diverse group of students who like Lee have an untapped affinity for finance but might otherwise not have thought to consider a career in banking—specifically sales and trading.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktcGF5LTIwMC1tbG4tcmVzb2x2ZS11cy1yZWNvcmQta2VlcGluZy1wcm9iZS0yMDIyLTA4LTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley to pay $200 million to resolve U.S. record-keeping probe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/morgan-stanley-pay-200-mln-resolve-us-record-keeping-probe-2022-08-05/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktcGF5LTIwMC1tbG4tcmVzb2x2ZS11cy1yZWNvcmQta2VlcGluZy1wcm9iZS0yMDIyLTA4LTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG1lbnRuZXdzLmNvbS9yZWd1bGF0aW9uLWFuZC1sZWdpc2xhdGlvbi9uZXdzL2ZpbnJhLWZpbmVzLW1vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LTMyNTAwMC1vdmVyLXJlc2VhcmNoLWVycm9ycy0yMjUwMjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finra fines Morgan Stanley $325000 over research errors,"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. has censured Morgan Stanley and fined the firm $325000 for publishing research reports that included inaccurate historical stock ratings.

In its letter of acceptance waiver and consent Finra said that Morgan Stanley used a software program to generate price charts that appeared in its research disclosures. The firm revised the software on or around Aug. 30 2019 to address new European Union regulatory requirements that required the disclosure of five years of information for a recommended security under certain circumstances.

The revised software contained a typographical error that caused the price charts in certain research reports to display stock ratings from five years prior to the report but labeled those ratings inaccurately as being from three years prior to the report. The software error affected only the presentation of historical ratings within the price charts Finra said.

A firm supervisory analyst identified an inaccurate historical stock rating in a price chart of a research report in January 2020 and escalated the issue. As a result of the price-chart software error however the firm published approximately 11000 research reports between Aug. 30 2019 and Feb. 28 2020 that included price charts with inaccurate historical stock ratings.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered the firm’s price target on Fisker shares from $15 to $10 while downgrading the rating from Overweight to Equalweight. The downgrades comes after Fisker’s earnings results reported earlier this week.

Jonas said the EV maker is “in a situation where access to capital in the next 6 months would be highly deterministic to the company’s fundamental performance” estimating the need to raise between $0.5 billion and $1 billion by early 2023.

“We covered largely in-line results and a reiterated start of production (SOP) and cash burn guide in our reaction note. In this note we update our earnings forecasts and price target to reflect the need for substantial outside capital (we estimate between $500mm and $1bn by early next year) in order to fund the ramp of the Ocean as well as development/capex related to other products we have given Fisker credit for in our forecasts” the analyst said.

In addition the analyst warned to the continuing macro and geopolitical risk including European gas shortage risk elevating the near term execution risk considering Fisker‘s vehicles will be produced in Gratz Austria.

“While the supply chain situation may be improving and the company may be benefiting from easing material costs and a weak Euro we believe the company is in the situation where access to capital in the next 6 months would be highly deterministic to the company’s fundamental performance. Continuing macro and geopolitical risk compounded by European gas shortage risk (100% of Fisker’s production is in Austria) elevates the near term execution risk”.

“As such we now assume FSR raises $1bn in 4Q22 at the current share price of $10/share compared to a $1.5bn debt raise in FY23 that we modeled previously creating substantial dilution. This coupled with a more modest outlook for volume through 2030 reduces our price target to $10 (vs. $15 previously) and rating to EW vs. OW previously.”

On Wednesday Fisker reported its second quarter earnings results where it confirmed the sold-out of the 5000 units special units for the Ocean model amid a non-refundable $5000 reservation.

The company said it has over $850 million of cash and cash equivalents reflecting its “prudent liquidity management and is sufficient to fund the production launch of the Fisker Ocean in November 2022 and for additional vehicle development throughout 2022”.

“We are delighted to announce that the 5000 limited edition Fisker Ocean One pre-order units are completely sold out thanks to pioneering customers in all nine launch markets: Austria Canada Denmark France Germany Norway Sweden United Kingdom and the United States” Henrik Fisker Fisker CEO stated.

On Monday Fisker CEO unveiled that the upcoming Ocean Model will bring streaming apps like Youtube Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video but also the web browser Google Chrome.

Last week the company said the model will be showcased on Pebble Beach Automotive Week at Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance from August 18 — 21. The pure electric SUV model made its European public debut in late February at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (Spain) and starts at $37499 for the Sport trim version.

Earlier in the week the Ocean model arrived in Los Angeles to start the road tests ahead of the mass production and the first deliveries scheduled for November in Graz Austria.

In late July the company confirmed it will open its first Brand Experience Center in Europe this November. The center will be located in downtown Munich (Kaufingerstraße Street) near the Marienplatz one of the touristy points in the German city.

And Musk is a lot to handle. From getting high in public to raising the ire of many for his comments on the declining birth rate in the US and how he is doing his bit to solve the problem ( he has nine children ) Musk sure keeps his conservative and religious “fixer” busy.

Elon Musk’s empire which includes SpaceX Tesla The Boring Company and Neuralink is worth around US$270 billion so it’s no surprise that he has surrounded himself with key figures who protect his personal and business interests.

Meet the guy that the world’s richest man turns to to fix his problems handle his fortune and make sure he stays in-line … for the most part.

Jared Birchall’s background in financial services

According to Yahoo Finance Birchall has a bachelor of arts from Brigham Young University. He initially started out as a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs before moving to Merrill Lynch as a private wealth adviser. Bloomberg reported he was fired from Merrill Lynch for allegedly “sending correspondence to a client without management approval”.

He later became senior vice-president at Morgan Stanley where he became known for his handling of wealthy client’s assets. In 2016 he was hired by Musk as the managing director of Excession LLC his family office.

Although his boss has a reputation for outlandish comments published for all to see on social media Birchall is more subdued. Bloomberg reported that former classmates don’t specifically remember him and even in the workplace colleagues have spoken about recognising his name but that’s where it ends. What is known is that he is a devout Mormon and is a married father of five.

Birchall has quickly become one of the key players in Musk’s inner circle. Excession LLC is the office from where most of his money is managed reported Bloomberg. He is also a board member at the Musk Foundation and responsible for handling the billionaire’s itinerary.

According to Bloomberg Birchall has the final say on everything regarding Musk from organising transport for his boss to hiring nannies for his children and ensuring his security. To insiders Birchall is considered the No 1 confidant and the one person Musk trusts implicitly.

He makes big deals

Bloomberg reported it was Birchall who was behind Musk’s initial plan to buy Twitter Inc. He put together a complex deal that involved a US$12.5 billion loan from Morgan Stanley and other sources linked to Musk’s stake in Tesla.

In 2018 Birchall was tasked with digging up dirt on cave diver Vernon Unsworth who criticised Musk’s suggestion that a SpaceX submarine suit might be used to help them save a football team trapped in a cave in Thailand. In a later defamation suit brought by Unsworth Birchall admitted to using a false name and hiring an investigator. He went on to say he often used false names in an effort to gather information for anything his boss desires."

Nasdaq has recorded a significant jump in ESG issues being discussed on corporate issuers’ quarterly conference calls with around 65 percent of Russell 3000 firms and 76 percent of MSCI USA ESG Leaders talking ESG in Q1 2022.

The most popular ESG topics over the quarter were climate transition sustainability and supply chain management followed by company culture and human capital management.

Nasdaq’s figures include big quarter-on-quarter jumps in conversations around some of the biggest ESG themes. Among MSCI USA ESG Leaders for example 49 percent of firms discussed their climate transition plans on Q1 2022 conference calls up from 28 percent the previous quarter.

Currently the main players driving the uptick in the climate transition conversation tend to be industrials utilities and energy sector companies but Nasdaq believes that the expectations for companies outside these sectors to assess their climate transition risks and disclose plans for mitigating and managing these risks will continue to rise in the next few quarters.

Shea Drake a senior analyst on Nasdaq’s ESG Advisory team says that while the key ESG themes remained unchanged from the previous quarter the team was surprised to see just how quickly momentum had grown around these topics. ""We were expecting to see an increase but to see the jump we saw quarter over quarter was pretty impressive"" she says.

The sell-side spotlight

Nasdaq’s research uses natural language processing to analyze more than 3000 earnings transcripts across the Russell 3000 and MSCI USA ESG Leaders indices to identify and gauge trends in key conversation topics across the previous quarter’s earnings season in order to help guide companies in how they shape their ESG messaging going forward.

The firm found that climate transition in particular is also increasingly coming under the sell-side spotlight. In fact nearly half of all ESG-related questions on the earnings call Q&A were related to climate transition with analysts questioning company management about climate three to four times more frequently than any other topic.

""The trends we are seeing indicate that investors are increasingly taking an interest in the growing vulnerabilities companies are facing related to climate change adverse economic conditions and heightened geopolitical risk"" says Michele Holtkamp another senior analyst on the Nasdaq ESG Advisory team. ""That in particular is why we look at the Q&A segment of the earnings call to understand how frequently companies are being asked about these issues regardless of whether they mentioned the topic in question in their prepared remarks.""

The wider benefits of talking ESG

While the figures show a big jump in conversations taking place overall across the different indexes covered in Nasdaq’s research Drake and Holtkamp point to differences across both sector and market cap.

For example supply chain management takes ""center stage"" at industrials and consumer discretionary names within the MSCI USA ESG Leaders Index where 51 percent and 46 percent respectively discussed the topic on earnings calls along with more than 40 percent of IT issuers within both the MSCI and Russell 3000 indices.

Despite differences – with some companies such as those in industrials and utilities ""dominating the discussion around climate transition"" – Holtkamp adds that ""across all sectors we’re seeing persistent focus on human capital and supply chain management. These issues are pretty hard to ignore."" She also notes that in the prior quarter review commentary from the tech sector suggested these companies expected supply chain constraints to decline in subsequent quarters. Now in the Q1 earnings discussions the prevailing theme of discussions on this topic is how companies have strengthened their supply-chain management programs to increase their relative resiliency and drive profitability.

Looking at differences across cap size Drake says it’s true that at the moment there is less pressure on smaller firms around ESG. ""But that’s not to say they shouldn’t be thinking about ESG issues"" she says.

""As expected large and mega-cap companies were the ones primarily leading the conversation and we’re also starting to see an uptick from mid-cap companies. Currently small-cap companies definitely do not bring as much ESG conversation to the table and that’s because they’re focused on growing their businesses and also making sure they’re satisfying their shareholders first.""

But Drake adds that with issues like ESG what you often see is a ""trickle-down effect."" Indeed conversations have already begun at the small-cap level she notes with the expectation that momentum will grow over time.

""Conversations don’t have to be as robust as with an ESG leader yet"" she notes. ""Moving forward however we expect ESG components to be integrated into the earnings call for small-cap companies too.""

Holtkamp adds that Nasdaq is also increasingly seeing companies start their ESG journey earlier and earlier – some even before going public. ""Pre-IPO companies are not trying to do everything at once but by dedicating some attention towards getting the ball moving on key elements that build a strong foundation earlier on they position themselves for stronger performance right out of the gate"" she explains.

As ESG issues have become increasingly key to company narrative Drake says talking about these topics offers a wider benefit for both firms and the investment community: ""With the current market conditions ESG is almost a fallback point for companies to explain how they are preparing for long-term value creation via non-financial risks and opportunities.""

Since last November the company has been rolling out the games as a way to keep users engaged between show releases. The games are accessible only to subscribers but have to be downloaded as separate apps.

The games have been downloaded a total of 23.3 million times and average 1.7 million daily users according to Apptopia an app analytics company. That's less than 1% of Netflix's 221 million subscribers.

The importance of games to Netflix's overall strategy has arguably increased in recent months as the company faces intensifying competition for user attention. In the second quarter Netflix lost nearly a million subscribers after losing 200000 subscribers during the first quarter — its first subscriber declines in more than a decade.

In a letter to shareholders last year Netflix named Epic Games and TikTok as among its biggest rivals for people's time.

""One of the many advantages to Netflix in pursuing the strategy is the ability to drive engagement beyond when the show first comes out on the platform"" D.A Davidson senior analyst Tom Forte said.

Still Netflix Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said last year the company was ""many months and really frankly years"" into learning how games can keep customers on the service.

""We're going to be experimental and try a bunch of things"" Peters said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. ""But I would say the eyes that we have on the long-term prize really center more around our ability to create properties that are connected to the universes the characters the stories that we're building.""

The company's current catalog of 24 game apps covers a variety of genres and Netflix shows such as ""Stranger Things: 1984."" Several are modeled after popular card games such as ""Mahjong Solitaire"" and ""Exploding Kittens.""

Streaming giant Netflix has touched down in the Decentraland metaverse.

The purpose is two-fold: promote its new action movie “The Gray Man” featuring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans and explore new interactive ways that a brand can connect with fans virtually.

The film is a spy thriller and Netflix’s 45-parcel Decentraland activation is aptly considered a “Metaverse Mission.” Decentraland recreated a landscape from the movie — a labyrinth that users must navigate by proving their knowledge about the movie’s plot along the way.

Blockworks demoed the experience alongside Martin Shibuya the art director at Decentraland Foundation and Diego Alvarez the senior business developer at The Electric Factory the programmers and architects behind the game.

Upon entering the maze users hear the film’s original music and protagonist Ryan Gosling’s instruction video.

In partnership with Netflix Latin America Decentraland said the best way to access the metaverse was by replicating an actual scene from the movie. This not only attracts those who had already seen the movie but also “boosts the users that happen to be in Decentraland playing in the maze and gets them to watch the film” Shibuya said.

The month-long experiment is a way for big brands to enter the metaverse by renting out virtual land for a short specific project as opposed to purchasing it. According to Alvarez the companies doing this today “are going to have a huge advantage tomorrow if they understand how this works and how people can interact” in the metaverse.

Users must answer questions about “The Gray Man” to move forward in the maze.

He added tha the metaverse is “about having fun about getting in touch with other people here. And that’s why we have this stimulus [trivia game] that makes you feel like you are always doing something.”

In its first week live Decentraland says it saw 2000 users go through the maze. Once users reach the fountain at the center and unlock a secret room they can connect their crypto wallets to record their completion time. The fastest time logged at the time of the demo was thirteen seconds.

Users navigate the maze to reach a fountain and unlock a hidden room.

Users can also select rewards like a free wearable for their avatar added immediately to their wallets. The choices include the signature looks of the three main agents; Sierra Six’s jacket Lloyd’s mustache and polo shirt and Miranda’s blazer and bob.

Users may select a wearable for their avatar based on outfits worn by characters in the movie.

Brands and companies are still finding the best way to leverage blockchain technology to interact with their customers Alvarez said. “There is so much opportunity that Web3 offers the world of entertainment especially when it comes to immersive storytelling and audience engagement.”

“There is a lot of room for improvement” when it comes to onboarding more users into the metaverse added Shibuya who thinks it’s important for virtual worlds to become protocols that are open to everyone where the ownership of digital assets is standard.

Decentraland is also home to major brands such as Samsung Nike and Coca-Cola. The platform also recently hosted the Metaverse Fashion Week where luxury fashion houses including Dolce & Gabbana hosted catwalks to showcase their latest wearables.

Though various interested parties have been attempting to figure out how to bring some version of this story to the screen since the early 1990s they all eventually found themselves broken on the rocks of the comic’s epic scope complex lore and constantly shifting genres.

Originally published in 1989 the comic series ran for 75 issues spawned multiple spinoffs and essentially became a gateway drug to the world of comics and graphic novels for an entire generation of moody Gen-Xers and English majors who loved Gaiman’s mix of classic mythology familiar literary tropes and excellent sartorial choices. (Hands up if you too unironically wore an ankh everywhere thanks to Death of the Endless. Sorry not sorry.)

A story that is essentially about telling stories The Sandman features nods to classical literature art and folk tales from around the world. Its cast of characters includes anthropomorphic immortals monsters demons talking animals real-life historical figures and literal nightmares and its narrative encompasses life death and everything in between. (Sometimes literally!) It’s full of standalone tales that are often only connected by the thinnest of narrative threads (i.e. the existence of the titular Sandman) and seemingly bizarre interludes whose relevance to the comics’ larger story doesn’t become clear until much (much) later. In short: The Sandman is truly strange and deeply beautiful and there is honestly nothing else out there like it.

This is all to say that I was ready to hate the heck out of Netflix’s lush extremely expensive-looking new 10-episode adaptation of Gaiman’s seminal work if only because I’ve spent over half my life waiting for someone to do a live-action version of this story and getting my heart repeatedly broken in the process. And to be clear Netflix’s The Sandman isn’t perfect. But goodness it’s so so much more than I ever thought I’d get. Fans of the original will inevitably find things to nitpick—and to be fair there are some fairly significant changes to the source material—but the heart of the comics story is here with many scenes that look as though they were lifted straight from the pages of specific issues and an incredible ensemble cast that manages to embrace even the weirdest of twists with open hearts.

In the most basic sense The Sandman is the story of Morpheus (Tom Sturridge) informally referred to as Dream the Lord of the Dreaming and one of seven immortal beings known as the Endless who are essentially personifications of various aspects of human reality. (His siblings are Destiny Death Desire Despair Delirium and Destruction. Try saying that five times fast.) The series begins with Dream’s capture by a mortal occultist named Roderick Burgess (Charles Dance) who strips him of his symbols of office—a pouch of sand a powerful magical ruby and his very disturbing Helmet of Dreams—and holds him prisoner for the better part of a century.

The episodes that follow see the Lord of the Dreaming attempt to rebuild the kingdom which has fallen into disrepair in his absence try to find his missing totems of power and reconnect with his family—various members of which have mixed feelings of their own about his return. Along the way he’ll be forced to wrestle with the way his imprisonment has not only changed the waking and dreaming worlds he left behind but his view of his own role within them both. But part of the beauty of The Sandman is that Dream’s journey is hardly the only narrative throughline the series is following. Mirroring the episodic nature of the comic itself the show is a gorgeous genre-hopping exploration of family and mortality loss and life that incorporates elements of both serialized and anthology-style storytelling from episode to episode.

As it seamlessly shifts between time periods settings and genres the show moves from high fantasy to horror and everything in between. Dream’s story doesn’t always unfold in a straight line (and sometimes he isn’t even the primary character in the episode we’re watching) and it’s apparent that while he may be this show’s titular lead he is not always its protagonist. Rather there’s an ever-present sense that Dream is part and parcel of a much larger and interconnected world full of hidden corners to explore and new stories to seek out.

The Sandman takes us from the world of dreams to contemporary London and even Hell itself introducing an array of intriguing supporting characters along the way including Johanna Constantine (Jenna Coleman) a genderswapped version of the famous DC Comics sorcerer; a Burgess descendent named John Dee (David Thewlis) who wants to use Morpheus’s stolen ruby to craft a more honest world; and Lucifer Morningstar herself (a tremendous Gwendolyn Christie clearly having the time of her life decked out in a pair of towering black wings).

If the scope of all this sounds incredibly daunting that’s kind of because it is. This is a vast epic story with dozens of secondary and side characters some of who may only appear in an episode or two this season (though many of them will undoubtedly show up again should the show return for a second outing). But the lush visuals and thoroughly lived-in feel of this expansive universe help the whole thing seem full of not just magic but possibility and Sturridge’s central performance as Dream is the quietly smoldering glue that holds it all together.

It must be said that Dream essentially an immortal god who has his world rocked when he learns what it means to be truly vulnerable is not the easiest of roles especially given how much of the story essentially relies on him basically being weird and unknowable. But Sturridge’s performance easily bridges the removed and the immediate showing us a Morpheus who is not only capable of real growth but new understanding as he is forced to —for what feels like the first time in his very long life—both ask for and accept help from those around him both human and not. Kirby Howell-Baptiste is also a standout as Dream’s sibling Death whose performance feels so fully embodied and necessary that you’ll forget that she only technically appears in a single episode.

It’s going to be interesting to see how people who haven’t spent half their lives absorbing Sandman lore respond to this Netflix version of the story which doesn’t necessarily make it easy for folks who push play on episode one with no idea of what the Endless are or why the Dreaming matters. Will this story resonate with people who aren’t already familiar with these characters and their connections or who don’t gasp audibly when one of the Endless references “the prodigal” out loud? Thankfully the back half of the season adapts the comic arc “The Doll’s House” which features a more straightforward type of story in which a human girl named Rose Walker whose search for her missing brother Jed helps ground The Sandman’s expansive mythos in more relatable real-world stakes.

Yet in the end Rose’s story becomes something more than it initially appears on the surface exploring much grander themes and deeper truths than viewers likely expected. The same can be said of The Sandman itself whose seemingly disparate parts are something greater when taken together as a whole and will—when we hopefully get a second season—only grow from here. Welcome to the Dreaming world.

An Inter-Agency Committee led by the Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources responsible for mining Mr. George Mireku Duker and the Ahafo Regional Minister Mr. George Boakye with the support of officials from the Minerals Commission Environmental Protection Agency and Newmont Africa led the discussion to commit GH¢45million in relief payment with community leaders and representatives of the unauthorised structures in the project area.

“The agreed one-off payments will promote community peace and security of the Ahafo North Project. We will not tolerate any further development of unauthorised structures which adversely affects company-community relations and discourages mining investment in the country” Mr. Duker said adding that government was hopeful that the project would commence soon and create significant value including employment business opportunities infrastructure socio-economic development as well as increased revenue in taxes royalties and forex inflows.

On his part Mr. Boakye said: “Though the structures were unauthorised Newmont had agreed to government’s recommendation to offer a relief payment package in the interest of peaceful co-existence with its host communities.” He added that he was certain that the project would commence soon and create local employment community development and business opportunities.

The Newmont Corporation Board of Directors approved full funds for Ahafo North Project in July 2021. David Thornton Regional Senior Vice President Newmont Africa Operations said the company is “committed to collaborating with government our host communities and other stakeholders to ensure the Ahafo North Project will continue and create sustainable value along with opportunity for all stakeholders”.

So he innovated,"More than two decades ago Christian Bagg ended up in a wheelchair after a snowboarding crash. It left him paralyzed from the waist down. An avid outdoorsman the Calgarian tried everything he could to get back to the great outdoors. Eventually he found a way.

When Christian Bagg broke his back and became paralyzed from the waist down 26 years ago he was worried he wouldn't be able to continue doing the things he loved like snowboarding climbing and biking.

But with a background in machining he figured why not invent a solution? As an apprentice with the University of Calgary's engineering department he was able to set his ideas in motion.

More than two decades later Bagg is back to gravel racing cyclocross racing and riding mountain trails — all while using an adaptive bike he created.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"" Bagg said.

""We want the world of biking to be as vast for the adaptive crowd as it is for the able-bodied crowd.""

Bagg is the founder of Bowhead Corp. an adaptive off-road biking company based in Calgary that aims to give people with disabilities better access to the outdoors.

The company has sold bikes to people across the world Bagg says from Chile to Norway to Australia. The bikes were also just featured on a recent episode of the Amazing Race Canada.

Other adaptive bikes do exist but he found them either bulky or unable to manoeuvre over the uneven trails he wanted to explore. Wheelchairs didn't work either as they'd tip over on unstable ground.

""The mechanism of the bike allows one wheel to be higher and one wheel to be lower"" he said.

""We're going through nature over obstacles side slopes leaning into corners and really creating a three-wheel version of a two-wheel bike — and it really just fits seamlessly with the way a cyclist would ride.""

Originally Bagg just wanted to be able to hike with his friends and family again. But then he met a young girl with cerebral palsy and saw her reaction to his invention.

""At that moment that's when it was like OK this has to be for everybody.""

Baggs says they've created two bikes so far and a third will be released this fall. They'd also like to produce adaptive wheelchairs. (David Mercer/CBC)

The company moved from the basement to an office space just two years ago. Its team has expanded to include engineers content creators and athletes who've experienced injuries.

People are using the bikes to jump at bike parks walk their dogs or compete alongside able-bodied athletes Bagg says.

""Often with adaptive equipment you're limited by the equipment. But in this scenario you're really only limited by yourself as to what you can do.""

Bowhead bikes

Bowhead Corp. has come out with two bike models so far with a third on the way.

One is an all-electric bike which some quadriplegic bikers can use due to adapted handlebars. The other is operated by a hand crank but it does have a motor for assistance.

""We're very unique in the world as far as our technology goes"" Bagg said.

""The suspension is independent from the leaning. The leaning is independent from the steering. So this level of control is unique.""

Max Flowerday is an engineer-in-training with the team's research and development department. To him the bikes are great at simulating a more traditional mountain biking experience.

""What the articulating front does is it allows the rider to actually lean into the corner and ride in the same way that a non-adaptive bike would ride. So that's super important"" he said.

""It's not like you're riding a shopping cart. You're riding something that really provides this immersive experience.""

Max Flowerday says he always wanted to apply his engineering education to the sporting goods industry. When he found Bowhead it was a perfect fit he says. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's important for the designers to think through all the details closely. Flowerday says he came up with an idea to ensure the bike chain wouldn't derail since some of the company's customers would find it difficult to troubleshoot that problem on the fly.

""Something we're trying to focus on is making these bikes as reliable as possible.""

The designs are also evolving and when a bike is improved the new parts are compatible with older models. Bagg says he wanted customers to be able to swap out components to personalize their ride.

""I know what our customers can do now. I want to see what they can do in five years if we all put our brain power together at Bowhead and give them something amazing"" he said.

'It's just freedom'

Gustavo Ortiz a mountain bike racer from Chile is back competing after discovering the company.

He was injured while visiting Whistler five years ago and says it was difficult to get excited about sports again. When he got onto one of Bowhead's bikes his passion was rekindled he said.

""It's just freedom for me. It's like I can get anywhere I want with no help"" he said. ""I'm really stoked about it.""

He has already attended some competitions in Canada this summer and plans to continue working around the circuit.

Gustavo Ortiz says he's been racing all over the world since he was 12 years old and has always loved bikes. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's stories like this that keep pushing the Bowhead team forward. Bagg says they're continuing to evolve and want to expand to adaptive wheelchairs while continuing to improve their current products.

And while the business moves forward Bagg continues to reap the rewards of his labour.

Out on the trails he is managing long steep climbs navigating over rocky pathways and squeezing through tight trails.

""You get that sort of euphoric effort you know sweating and heart pounding and you're there with your friends on their bikes and they're feeling the same thing"" he said.

""It's something that I thought that I had lost that I got back with that bike.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzL21vcmUtYnVpbGRlcnMtd2lsbC1nby1icm9rZS13YXJuaW5nLWZyb20tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWJvc3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS84ZGY3ZTk1MmJiMzk2ZDgyOGE2N2QxZDhiMjkxODhjNNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzL21vcmUtYnVpbGRlcnMtd2lsbC1nby1icm9rZS13YXJuaW5nLWZyb20tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWJvc3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS84ZGY3ZTk1MmJiMzk2ZDgyOGE2N2QxZDhiMjkxODhjND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building boss issues grim warning,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/more-builders-will-go-broke-warning-from-construction-boss/news-story/8df7e952bb396d828a67d1d8b29188c4 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzL21vcmUtYnVpbGRlcnMtd2lsbC1nby1icm9rZS13YXJuaW5nLWZyb20tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWJvc3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS84ZGY3ZTk1MmJiMzk2ZDgyOGE2N2QxZDhiMjkxODhjNNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzL21vcmUtYnVpbGRlcnMtd2lsbC1nby1icm9rZS13YXJuaW5nLWZyb20tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWJvc3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS84ZGY3ZTk1MmJiMzk2ZDgyOGE2N2QxZDhiMjkxODhjND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvc3dpbS1zdGFyLWFyaWFybmUtdGl0bXVzLWJ1eXMtaW4tZ29sZGVuLXN1YnVyYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swim star Ariarne Titmus buys in golden suburb - realestate.com.au,"SWIMMING sensation Ariarne Titmus has the perfect place to celebrate her success at the Commonwealth Games when she returns home.

So he innovated,"More than two decades ago Christian Bagg ended up in a wheelchair after a snowboarding crash. It left him paralyzed from the waist down. An avid outdoorsman the Calgarian tried everything he could to get back to the great outdoors. Eventually he found a way.

When Christian Bagg broke his back and became paralyzed from the waist down 26 years ago he was worried he wouldn't be able to continue doing the things he loved like snowboarding climbing and biking.

But with a background in machining he figured why not invent a solution? As an apprentice with the University of Calgary's engineering department he was able to set his ideas in motion.

More than two decades later Bagg is back to gravel racing cyclocross racing and riding mountain trails — all while using an adaptive bike he created.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"" Bagg said.

""We want the world of biking to be as vast for the adaptive crowd as it is for the able-bodied crowd.""

Bagg is the founder of Bowhead Corp. an adaptive off-road biking company based in Calgary that aims to give people with disabilities better access to the outdoors.

The company has sold bikes to people across the world Bagg says from Chile to Norway to Australia. The bikes were also just featured on a recent episode of the Amazing Race Canada.

Other adaptive bikes do exist but he found them either bulky or unable to manoeuvre over the uneven trails he wanted to explore. Wheelchairs didn't work either as they'd tip over on unstable ground.

""The mechanism of the bike allows one wheel to be higher and one wheel to be lower"" he said.

""We're going through nature over obstacles side slopes leaning into corners and really creating a three-wheel version of a two-wheel bike — and it really just fits seamlessly with the way a cyclist would ride.""

Originally Bagg just wanted to be able to hike with his friends and family again. But then he met a young girl with cerebral palsy and saw her reaction to his invention.

""At that moment that's when it was like OK this has to be for everybody.""

Baggs says they've created two bikes so far and a third will be released this fall. They'd also like to produce adaptive wheelchairs. (David Mercer/CBC)

The company moved from the basement to an office space just two years ago. Its team has expanded to include engineers content creators and athletes who've experienced injuries.

People are using the bikes to jump at bike parks walk their dogs or compete alongside able-bodied athletes Bagg says.

""Often with adaptive equipment you're limited by the equipment. But in this scenario you're really only limited by yourself as to what you can do.""

Bowhead bikes

Bowhead Corp. has come out with two bike models so far with a third on the way.

One is an all-electric bike which some quadriplegic bikers can use due to adapted handlebars. The other is operated by a hand crank but it does have a motor for assistance.

""We're very unique in the world as far as our technology goes"" Bagg said.

""The suspension is independent from the leaning. The leaning is independent from the steering. So this level of control is unique.""

Max Flowerday is an engineer-in-training with the team's research and development department. To him the bikes are great at simulating a more traditional mountain biking experience.

""What the articulating front does is it allows the rider to actually lean into the corner and ride in the same way that a non-adaptive bike would ride. So that's super important"" he said.

""It's not like you're riding a shopping cart. You're riding something that really provides this immersive experience.""

Max Flowerday says he always wanted to apply his engineering education to the sporting goods industry. When he found Bowhead it was a perfect fit he says. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's important for the designers to think through all the details closely. Flowerday says he came up with an idea to ensure the bike chain wouldn't derail since some of the company's customers would find it difficult to troubleshoot that problem on the fly.

""Something we're trying to focus on is making these bikes as reliable as possible.""

The designs are also evolving and when a bike is improved the new parts are compatible with older models. Bagg says he wanted customers to be able to swap out components to personalize their ride.

""I know what our customers can do now. I want to see what they can do in five years if we all put our brain power together at Bowhead and give them something amazing"" he said.

'It's just freedom'

Gustavo Ortiz a mountain bike racer from Chile is back competing after discovering the company.

He was injured while visiting Whistler five years ago and says it was difficult to get excited about sports again. When he got onto one of Bowhead's bikes his passion was rekindled he said.

""It's just freedom for me. It's like I can get anywhere I want with no help"" he said. ""I'm really stoked about it.""

He has already attended some competitions in Canada this summer and plans to continue working around the circuit.

Gustavo Ortiz says he's been racing all over the world since he was 12 years old and has always loved bikes. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's stories like this that keep pushing the Bowhead team forward. Bagg says they're continuing to evolve and want to expand to adaptive wheelchairs while continuing to improve their current products.

And while the business moves forward Bagg continues to reap the rewards of his labour.

Out on the trails he is managing long steep climbs navigating over rocky pathways and squeezing through tight trails.

""You get that sort of euphoric effort you know sweating and heart pounding and you're there with your friends on their bikes and they're feeling the same thing"" he said.

""It's something that I thought that I had lost that I got back with that bike.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzL21vcmUtYnVpbGRlcnMtd2lsbC1nby1icm9rZS13YXJuaW5nLWZyb20tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWJvc3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS84ZGY3ZTk1MmJiMzk2ZDgyOGE2N2QxZDhiMjkxODhjNNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzL21vcmUtYnVpbGRlcnMtd2lsbC1nby1icm9rZS13YXJuaW5nLWZyb20tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWJvc3MvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS84ZGY3ZTk1MmJiMzk2ZDgyOGE2N2QxZDhiMjkxODhjND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building boss issues grim warning,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.news.com.au', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /finance/small-business/more-builders-will-go-broke-warning-from-construction-boss/news-story/8df7e952bb396d828a67d1d8b29188c4 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83547220>, 'Connection to www.news.com.au timed out.

The advocates met outside the State House Thursday at a press conference organized by the climate justice nonprofit 350 NH Action.

“A transition to renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream. It’s happening elsewhere. It's possible here and it's needed here” said Seamus Burke a 350 NH intern who spoke at the rally.

New Hampshire falls behind its New England neighbors with only 19% of its in-state electricity generation coming from renewable sources as of 2020. Meanwhile renewable resources account for 79% of electricity generated in Maine  30% in Massachusetts and 100% in Vermont . And it’s the only state in the New England electricity grid that does not mandate greenhouse gas reductions economy-wide .

New Hampshire relies on four utility providers two of which—Eversource and Liberty— doubled their electricity rates this summer . On average residential customers will experience about a $70 increase in their electricity bills starting this month. Market forces due to the war in Ukraine extreme weather in places where natural gas is produced and increased demand have contributed to price spikes.

Laura Bratton / NHPR Climate activists' signs in Concord N.H.

Katie Lessard another 350 NH spokesperson demanded that Governor Chris Sununu go farther than his current plan to address rate hikes. “Change your actions or proceed knowing that all of us here today will do everything in our power to ensure you do not return to Concord next fall” she said.

She and other activists criticized Sununu for accepting donations from utilities and fossil fuel companies . This includes at least $4500 from Eversource this campaign cycle; donations from several oil companies for up to $5000; and a $15000 donation from NextEra Energy Seabrook the owner of the Seabrook nuclear power plant.

“We are calling on Governor Sununu to no longer prioritize the fossil fuel industry and companies and lobbyists that are giving him campaign donations” said Jamie Henn director of Fossil Free Media.

The governor’s press office replied to activists’ criticism in an email stating “To inaccurately claim that Governor Sununu has not acted to reduce the impacts of climate change is simply not supported by the facts.”

They pointed to a number of bills that Governor Sununu supported over the last few years including a 2019 law banning offshore drilling and more recent senate bills supporting offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine. They also cited the recent community power rules approved by the state’s utilities commission which will allow towns and cities to prioritize renewable energy sources and save money on their bills.

“The governor is committed to vetoing costly legislation that would raise costs for Granite Staters and is clear in his support for responsible legislation that lowers costs while delivering environmental benefits” they said.

Further they added that the governor is continuing to update his plan to support residents through electricity rate hikes.

The electric bill increases Granite Staters will start seeing in September are from a hike in the “default energy service rate” which is a pass-through cost. Eversource says that means they don’t profit off of that cost. But fossil fuel companies have been criticized for making record profits as natural gas prices soar.

“We need to rightly place the blame for profiteering and utility rate increases on the fossil fuel industry and the politicians holding fossil fuels in positions of power” said Henn.

Despite some climate-forward bills passing in New Hampshire this past legislative session several others including bills that would set up a youth environment education council and set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals died in committee or on the House floor .",,,

The shoe a white pair of the Nike Air Force 1 dressed in blue accents nods to Evo Moment #37 the extraordinary conclusion to a Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike game from 2004 that still stands as the most iconic moment in competitive fighting game history.

But what was meant to be a sneaker celebrating the fighting game scene arrived without any overt connection to it and was doomed to obscurity up until now. Professional fighting game player Justin Wong who was on the losing end of the Moment #37 battle learned of the Air Force 1 inspired by his most famous match just a few days ago.

“At first when someone tagged me I thought it was a troll or a fake” Wong says recalling how he only saw the shoe after a follower showed him a photo on Twitter.

Moment #37 happened in Pomona California at the the 2004 installment of the fighting game event Evo. The sequence goes something like this: Wong playing as Chun-Li patiently lands blows on an opposing Ken played by Daigo Umehara until his life bar is down to a pixel-thin sliver. With a healthy chunk of his own life still left Wong moves to finish the fight performing a 14-hit super move. If any single hit lands Wong wins. Even if his opponent tries to block Wong still wins because the game will let through a tiny amount of “chip damage” when a super move is blocked.

So whenever one of the most recognizable sportswear brands on the planet takes a loss it goes down in the history books. One of Nike's biggest misfires occurred in 2013 during a botched meeting with Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry.

At the time the 25-year-old phenom showed true promise but had not yet won any of his four NBA Championships two regular season MVP awards or even made a single All-Star appearance.

Curry had worn Nike throughout the first four years of his professional career but his first sneaker deal was ready to expire. So the Curry family took pitch meetings with all of the major sneaker companies.

An upstart company known as Under Armour offered $4 million per year plus a signature shoe and the chance to become the face of the company. Nike whose offer was worth $2.5 million per year declined its right to match the Under Armour money.

But Nike's meeting went horribly wrong when one of their representatives mispronounced Curry's name calling him ""Steph-on"" instead of ""Steph-en."" Even worse a repurposed PowerPoint slide displayed Kevin Durant's name.

The botched meeting became folklore among hoopers and sneakerheads alike. But like most stories that take on a life of their own there are often missing facts. Besides Nike no one's reputation took a bigger hit than Nico Harrison.

Harrison was Nike's Vice President of North American basketball operations and was known for his trustworthiness and deep personal connections with the NBA's most popular players. Most notably Kobe Bryant.

Harrison has had his name attached to the infamous 2013 meeting for nine years. Now the 49-year-old serves as the Dallas Mavericks general manager. Thanks to the Point Forward podcast hosted by Andre Iguodala and Evan Turner fans finally received some clarification about Harrison's role in the meeting.

Turner a former NBA player coach and serious sneakerhead had to ask Harrison about what actually happened that day. Harrison provided the following answer:

""There is an article out. And the article says I mispronounced his name. It wasn't me. It absolutely wasn't me. But they didn't know the other person they knew me. So they say I mispronounced his name because it's sexy. But I'm like first of all I've known this guy forever like since he was in high school. I used to represent his dad. How am I going to mispronounce his name? I might have called him Seth but I wasn't going to mispronounce his name. So yeah Nike made a mistake. In all honesty if he would have stayed with Nike his business would be a monster right now. A monster.""

So Curry's first name was mispronounced but not by Harrison. You can listen to the entire segment at the 44:20 mark in the latest episode.

The rest is history. Curry signed Under Armour's offer sheet in 2013 before inking a nine-year contract extension in 2015. Then in November 2020 Under Armour announced the launch of the Curry Brand.

Since partnering with Under Armour Curry's signature sneaker line has released nine models. Just yesterday the perennial All-NBA point guard debuted his upcoming 10th sneaker - the Curry 10.

Nike's failure to retain Curry will go down in the history books and be taught in business schools for years to come. Thanks to the Point Forward podcast we finally know both sides of the story and can clear Harrison's name of the gaff. Stay locked into FanNation Kicks for breaking news updates and interviews.

Preventing the next shooting inside the Mall of America

BLOOMINGTON Minn. -- After a gunman fired inside a crowded Nike store at the Mall of America on Thursday work is underway to prevent another shooting inside the massive shopping complex.

The Bloomington mall reopened Friday with more security in place. However the Nike store remains closed as investigators work to find the gunman and another man.

As police piece together what happened store managers in the mall are doing their own debriefing.

April Kimball the store manager at Home & Beyond had gone through a similar experience on New Year's Eve when a gunman opened fire on the mall's third level injuring two people one of them a bystander.

Kimball says that the response from her staff to this most-recent shooting was less chaotic and more like a drill. Her staff which includes her two daughters locked the doors turned off the lights and took themselves and about a dozen customers into the back room.

Dozens of security cameras cover the ceilings inside the Mall of America. One of them is located near the Nike store. However police have not yet released the surveillance footage.

Shoppers and store managers at the mall Friday said they noticed extra officers in uniform as well as some under cover officers wearing earpieces and carrying two-way radios.

Rail News: Short Lines & Regionals

By Jeff Stagl Managing Editor

The crux of short-line railroading is doing whatever it takes to add carloads to the ledger. Given the limited resources among regionals and short lines it typically requires a lot of scratching and clawing to build business.

It also takes ingenuity moxie stick-to-itiveness collaboration and a host of other characteristics which many small railroads continue to exhibit.

There are many examples of proven approaches and strategies employed by small railroads that have led to solid growth and that’s why the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) created the Business Development Awards. Launched in 1996 the awards recognize business-building initiatives that show innovation resourcefulness and success.

“The awards honor and highlight the core of what short lines are all about — how to get one more carload or one more customer. It’s the first thing they think about in the morning and the last thing they think about going to bed” says ASLRRA President Chuck Baker. “It’s the existential imperative to grow the business and you can’t do that by just sitting there. You’ve got to conjure up new business.”

Originally called the Marketing Awards the program’s name was changed in 2019 because the honors “really are all about business development” says ASLRRA Vice President of Communications Amy Krouse. The awards also have become quite competitive.

“Everyone wants to win one” says Krouse.

Carload Express Inc.

ASLRRA member railroads are invited to submit nominations for the award each year. The association encourages regionals and short lines to nominate themselves if they created: a proven marketing program or concept; an innovative method for providing customer service that resulted in an improved relationship with clientele; new concepts methods or models for better understanding a market and/or customers; a successful online presence; or an inventive promotion of e-commerce.

Strong consideration is given to examples of employing unique characteristics to develop new business while maintaining existing customers or working successfully with economic development authorities and Class Is. Other efforts that tend to be deemed worthy include those that show a small railroad became a positive economic factor in a community established strong relationships with a community and/or shippers identified and addressed a customer’s specific needs or reacted to market conditions with innovative and workable solutions.

Winners are chosen by a five-person panel that includes small railroad retirees industry experts and Class I officials but no ASLRRA staff members says Krouse.

The 2022 Business Development Award recipients are Carload Express Inc.’s Allegheny Valley Railroad Co. (AVR) Travero Co.’s CRANDIC Rail (formally known as the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway Co.) and North Shore Railroad Co.’s Union County Industrial Railroad (UCIR).

Travero Co./CRANDIC Rail

North Shore previously won the award in 2004 and 2017 while Carload Express’ Delmarva Central Railroad took home the honor in 2020.

Regionals and short lines that have won multiple awards over the years also include Arkansas Midland Railroad (1999 2006 2007 and 2012); Finger Lakes Railway (2011 and 2012); Heart of Georgia Railroad (2001 and 2015); Indiana Rail Road (2016 and 2020); Lake State Railway (2018 2019 and 2021); Montana Rail Link (2008 and 2014); New York & Atlantic Railway (2002 and 2013); Providence & Worcester Railroad (2000 and 2011); R. J. Corman/Central Kentucky Lines (2005 and 2008); R. J. Corman/Memphis Line (2005 and 2009); Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad (2010 2016 and 2020); and the St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad (1997 2000 2006 and 2009).

Following are summaries explaining why AVR CRANDIC Rail and UCIR earned the honor this year.

AVR: Transloading as a key lure

Launched in 1995 AVR operates 77 miles of track in the greater Pittsburgh area. The short line interchanges with CSX Norfolk Southern Railway the Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad and Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Co.

AVR won the award for establishing a Pittsburgh-area transload facility that has successfully served the local steel industry since opening in January 2021.

In early 2020 the short line began working on redeveloping a 4-acre-plus portion of its Glenwood Yard for the facility which features an overhead gantry crane and a more than 1000-foot side track. The transload center now serves Pittsburgh and surrounding markets in Ohio and West Virginia.

AVR officials first identified a key partner and main customer — a major steel producer that needed to ship plate steel by rail to the area for last-mile distribution by truck — and then began to engineer the facility. The railroad partnered with CSX and spent $725000 on the project.

After shipments began coming to the facility in first-quarter 2021 AVR concentrated on expediting product offloading operations to maximize the utilization of rail-car equipment and deliver material in manageable truckload quantities in a sequence that fit the main customer’s last-mile delivery needs ASLRRA officials said in an award summary. AVR spots inbound cars and then transloads materials to trucks for local deliveries.

Carload Express focuses on either adding business with existing customers by diverting trucks adding new business through industrial development or providing transload services to reach shippers who aren’t otherwise rail accessible says Mike Filoni the company’s chief marketing officer. Company leaders decided transloading was the best option in Glenwood Yard.

“Pittsburgh is known as a steel-producing mecca but raw steelmaking no longer is a big thing there. Now there are lots of processing facilities in the area” says Filoni. “We saw a demand for a transload facility in the area.”

The facility can handle any type of material moved by flat cars or gondolas such as steel coils structural steel semi-finished steel rebar and wire rods. It also can accommodate dimensional lumber.

Last year AVR logged about 500 carloads entering the transload facility which has helped diversify the commodity mix at Glenwood Yard. Carload Express expects a similar traffic target for the facility in 2022 says Filoni.

“We have room to grow the business there” he says.

CRANDIC Rail: Adding cars to add carloads

Owned by logistics services provider Travero CRANDIC Rail operates 100 miles of track in east-central Iowa including a 60-mile mainline from Cedar Rapids to Hills that runs through Coralville and Iowa City. The short line interchanges with or has connections to all the major Class Is as well as Iowa Interstate Railroad Ltd. and Iowa Northern Railway Co.

CRANDIC Rail continues to make strategic investments and show operational innovations that typify the short line industry’s entrepreneurial spirit ASLRRA officials say. The short line also strives to keep anticipating customers’ needs. For example CRANDIC Rail recently switched cars for a different shipper six times in a 24-hour period because that’s what it took.

Another example of the railroad’s business-building and customer-minded approach occurred last year when CRANDIC Rail acquired 122 box cars in March 2021. The railroad typically leases such cars as do most other regionals and short lines. Just prior to the purchase the short line leased 225 cars.

The acquired box cars are used to serve a major customer that produces cardboard for boxes and to obtain flexibility — if needed — to support Travero’s rail-served and food-grade-certified public warehouse and transload facility in Logistics Park Cedar Rapids that opened last year says CRANDIC Rail General Manager Cory Hoffmann.

“[The car] investment allowed local industries to meet their production schedules for their customers and move product as quickly as it was produced” he says.

This year the short line also increased its leased fleet by another 100 box cars boosting its total box-car fleet to between 400 and 500 cars.

In early 2021 CRANDIC Rail needed to make a key business decision: purchase or lease the box cars says Jillian Walsh Travero’s senior manager of business development and marketing partner.

The number of box cars in the rail industry continue to decline steeply due to a meteoric rise in the use of containers — which can be employed by different modes without the need to unload or reload cargo — a sharp drop in newsprint and the advent of precision scheduled railroading that stresses more efficient asset utilization.

“In five years the big issue is that the 50-foot standard box car could be gone” says Walsh.

CRANDIC Rail opted to buy the cars in part to show its commitment to the major cardboard shipper which uses a combination of trucking and rail. The company’s business has climbed since COVID-19 drove a big uptick in mail-order deliveries and cardboard box demand.

CRANDIC Rail’s efforts to improve customer service also meant the shipper could rely more on the short line while having additional box-car inventory on hand says Hoffmann.

“Because the trucking industry as a whole had more available loads than drivers it became more difficult to move some loads via truck at a competitive rate” he says.

Another reason CRANDIC Rail acquired the cars: to generate more box-car business. The short line moved a record amount of box-car traffic in 2021. Key shippers increased loads 28% year over year and 42% compared with the level achieved 10 years prior.

Box-car traffic is projected to remain strong in 2022 despite the Class Is’ service performance struggles says Hoffmann.

Building business in a 750-mile-plus to 500-mile radius by exploiting the Logistics Park Cedar Rapids facility to better compete with trucking will help drive traffic this year too. Despite additional product transfer costs a customer could use the warehouse and short line to ensure they have enough products nearby to smooth out demand peaks and avoid problems from an ongoing truck shortage CRANDIC Rail officials say.

UCIR: Honing a more personal touch

UCIR operates 18.2 miles of track in central Pennsylvania and interchanges with Canadian Pacific and NS. Although the short line serves only eight customers it’s found ways to grow carloads 300% over a recent 10-year period with zero Federal Railroad Administration-reportable injuries.

How? Primarily by forging new and innovative methods of providing customer service customizing business processes to meet customers’ needs fostering trust from shippers and deepening customer relationships officials at UCIR parent North Shore Railroad say.

“It’s part of our personal touch. We have custom car releases that provide cars to customers when they need them” says Loni Martz Briner North Shore’s public relations and media manager.

A relentless drive to be a better business partner with customers has opened the door to various new traffic opportunities says North Shore Business and Development Manager Joe Kantz.

“We don’t just deliver loads. We provide leads on pieces of land that are accessible and prolific pieces of real estate” he says.

Such an approach helped North Shore and UCIR land a “massive” new customer: Country View Family Farms LLC says Kantz. The company is building a $47.3 million 100-plus-acre feed mill expansion plant in New Columbia Pennsylvania that will be served by UCIR with interchange partner NS. To open in 2024 or 2025 the facility will support Country View’s hog production business.

“This land was not on the market. We looked at what Country View’s needs were including a loop track and connected them to the landowner” says Kantz. “You can’t find land like this that’s available in central Pennsylvania and on a short line.”

North Shore helped with the design of the loop track. The rail access was key to the project says Kantz.

Several years ago UCIR already had successfully attracted a major customer to its lines: GAF — North America’s largest roofing manufacturer — which built a $70 million facility. Last year the company opened a $100 million neighboring facility that produces insulated roofing says Kantz.

“We helped GAF with hiring and the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the newest facility” he says.

Moreover UCIR counts White Deer Gas Inc. as a large customer. The company operates the largest rail-served propane facility on the East Coast that features 48 30000-gallon tanks stationed in a row says Kantz. UCIR serves the facility nearly daily with NS.

“It’s enormous. We showed it to some Class I partners and they say the same thing about it” says Kantz.

Currently Winfield Storage is developing a transload facility along UCIR’s lines that will require the rehabilitation of an unused siding. It’s a good investment to make now since Pennsylvania is working on a $900 million throughway in the area — the largest highway project in the state’s history — that’s pegged for completion in 2027 says Kantz. The throughway’s north side is expected to open soon and construction crews are working on the south end.

“It’s a huge opportunity because of the access to a new highway” says Kantz.

The future appears bright for more business-building opportunities at UCIR because the short line maintains and markets an inventory of available properties along its lines.

“We are just getting started. We have more parcels to develop” says Kantz. “[UCIR] runs trains five days a week but a day will come soon when that won’t be enough.”

Oberman says railroad service is suffering for one simple reason: The big four U.S. Class I systems aren’t paying enough to retain and recruit train crews.

BNSF Railway CSX Transportation Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific are experiencing ongoing crew shortages that since last year have caused widespread congestion and significant delays.

The railroads say the crew shortage is largely due to factors that are out of their control. Crews furloughed at the onset of the pandemic didn’t return to the railroad at the same rates as they typically had and attrition rose due to the Great Resignation that accompanied the pandemic and has affected all businesses. Meanwhile the historically tight labor market has made it difficult to hire conductors an outdoor job with an unpredictable schedule and a significant amount of time spent away from home.

Oberman says he’s told each railroad CEO that “there is a price that will get you enough workers. I don’t know what that price is. But everything has a price.”

The railroads and the unions that represent most of their employees have been unable to reach a new contract after three years of fruitless negotiations. The two sides remain far apart with railroads offering a 17% raise and the unions seeking a 31% increase. The contract dispute is now before a Presidential Emergency Board which will make recommendations for a settlement.

In an interview last week Oberman declined to comment on the negotiations process or the Presidential Emergency Board. But he says it’s clear that higher pay would help the railroads attract enough new workers to restore service to normal levels.

“If you need another 400 crews to move those trains that are sitting out there pay whatever price you need to get them” Oberman says. “Don’t come in and tell me it’s hard to hire. And it’s not like they can’t afford it. They’re paying out billions and billions every year in stock buybacks. You could use some of that to get the workforce you need.”

Railroads have increased conductor training pay and are offering signing bonuses to new employees and retention bonuses to current conductors and engineers. They’ve also offered incentives for engineers and conductors to temporarily relocate to areas where crew shortages are the most severe.

Oberman contends that those efforts are falling short noting that staffing levels at the big four railroads have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. “The railroads are not offering sufficient rewards – a combination of quality of life and compensation – to keep people there. There’s a price at which people will stay” he says.

The board has no authority over rail labor matters. But it does regulate service which is tied to railroad employment levels. Oberman says it’s clear the railroads don’t have enough operating employees to provide adequate service.

The STB has no plans to use its mandate to oversee service as a way to indirectly regulate railroad crew levels. “I’m not a backdoor kind of guy” Oberman says.

But he questioned whether railroads at their current staffing levels are able to meet their common carrier obligation to provide service upon reasonable request.

If there were a more concrete way to enforce the common carrier obligation Oberman says it’s likely that railroads would do a better job of matching employment levels to freight demand. And if there were more specific definitions about what’s required under common carrier obligations perhaps shippers would file cases with the board Oberman says.

(He spoke with Trains News Wire before a key House committee introduced legislation that would set minimum service standards for shipments moving under tariffs and provide clearer direction to the STB regarding disputes over railroads’ common carrier obligations.)

Oberman notes that no shipper has yet brought a case to the board as a result of BNSF’s embargo on certain types of carload shipments moving to California which began June 27 and remains in force. “Hundreds of shippers’ stuff is not being moved — at all” Oberman says.

“To me all of these problems stem from a lack of competition” Oberman says.

Imagine he says if a McDonald’s fired all of its burger-flippers but one and told customers they’d have to wait an hour for their order to be ready. If there was a fully staffed Burger King across the street McDonald’s would lose customers and ultimately would have to hire more employees.

But if the next burger joint is 10 miles away Oberman says McDonald’s could get away with a lone burger flipper.

BNSF’s embargoed shippers are stuck in the same way as the McDonald’s customer would be. “BN doesn’t really have to fear losing those customers by having cut all those workers” Oberman says. “So they’re not incentivized to run the business any differently because there’s no real competition for so many rail users.”

UP which is struggling with crew shortage of its own in California has not tried to snare any of the traffic BNSF is unable to move Oberman says.

Railroads say they’ve lost volume and revenue because they can’t meet freight demand and that they have every incentive to provide good service.

“I have not been shy about making my views known. I think the board shares them in general” Oberman says. “Railroads just have not employed enough human beings to get the job done.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xMTUwMDAtcmFpbHJvYWQtd29ya2Vycy1hcmUtd2VpZ2hpbmctYS1uYXRpb25hbC1zdHJpa2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,115000 Railroad Workers Are Weighing a National Strike,"After thirty months of stalled contract negotiations amid the pandemic — all while enduring stagnant wages heavier workloads unsafe conditions and draconian attendance policies — 115000 fed-up US freight railroad workers are mobilizing for a possible national strike. On Saturday a few hundred rail workers from multiple craft unions gathered with allies in Galesburg Illinois to signal to the federal government and major rail carriers that they are ready for a showdown. “I have never seen in my experience working in this industry the kind of unity that you all are displaying right now” Greg Regan president of the AFL-CIO’s Transportation Trades Department told the crowd. “This is not just a rail labor fight; this is a labor movement fight.” Some of the craft unions represented at the Galesburg event included the Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) the Teamsters’ Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED) and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Iron Ship Builders Blacksmiths Forgers and Helpers (Boilermakers). Due to the cumbersome bargaining process of the 1926 Railway Labor Act (RLA) — which allowed Joe Biden to intervene last month by appointing a presidential emergency board to make recommendations to try resolving the dispute — the earliest a work stoppage could occur is September. Although US labor history is replete with militant railroad strikes that have brought the economy to a halt such actions have become rare in modern times thanks to the legal constraints of the RLA and ongoing division of rail workers into a dozen separate craft unions. But many of the workers believe a strike could happen this time around. Last month members of the Teamsters-affiliated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen voted to authorize a strike with over 99.5 percent approval. SMART-TD’s general chairpersons have also taken the first step toward authorizing a work stoppage. All twelve rail unions are currently negotiating in lockstep at the bargaining table to try to maximize their leverage seeking raises that keep up with inflation lower health care costs and expanded paid leave.

“More With Less” For several years major “Class I” rail carriers like BNSF Union Pacific Norfolk Southern and CSX have implemented ​precision scheduled railroading (PSR) — a kind of lean production just-in-time model designed to maximize shareholder profits by slashing expenses. “PSR is a marketing thing not a logistical thing” said Johnny Walker a seventeen-year train conductor and SMART-TD member who traveled from Baltimore to attend the Galesburg rally. “There’s no standardization. The PSR metrics are different for BNSF or CSX or Union Pacific so there’s nothing to go on. It’s like the wolf guarding the henhouse.” Because of PSR cost cutting in the past six years the Class I railroads have collectively lost 29 percent of their workforce or about forty-five thousand employees leaving the industry severely understaffed and unable to move freight efficiently. “I blame the carriers for supply chain disruption and possibly even inflation. Things aren’t getting to market because the railroads aren’t shipping the goods” said Matt Weaver an Ohio-based organizer for the BMWED also a longtime rail worker who attended Saturday’s rally. While PSR has harmed workers shippers and consumers it has given the rail carriers record profits with shareholders raking in $183 billion in buybacks and dividends over the last decade. “My prediction is our rail industry is going to end up like Enron where they made a whole bunch of money but it wasn’t real” Walker said. Although railroading has always involved grueling hours and irregular schedules the industry has traditionally been able to recruit and retain workers by offering relatively good pay and strong retirement benefits. That is no longer the case. “The word’s out that the railroad’s not the big dog on the block anymore when it comes to employers” explained Nick Allen a Galesburg BMWED member who helped organize the rally. “They cut it back so far that now they’re in a hiring frenzy to try to fill jobs that they just can’t fill anymore.” Remaining workers are forced to clock even longer and less predictable hours through strict attendance policies. “They’re doing more with less. They have to take steps to get us to work more because of their own inefficiencies in hiring the right amount of people” said Jordan Booth a SMART-TD member in Galesburg who also helped organize the rally. Mark McDannald Jr a Boilermakers member who works at the Galesburg diesel shop said he has seen nearly sixty of his coworkers leave in the past year due to inadequate paid sick leave and deteriorating working conditions. “They’re going to different jobs because they’re making better money. The retirement isn’t even keeping them working here. It’s not even worth it” he said. “The attrition is terrible” Weaver said. “When I applied [in 1994] there were six hundred people in the room. Now there’s like three or four.” Workers say the railroads are using the staffing shortage to try to justify their long-sought goal of reducing freight train crews from at least two workers to only one. “With the way they’re complaining about how they can’t get enough manpower more than likely there’s only going to be one person to tie down the train and go walk the train” Walker said. Walker noted the danger of having one-person crews pointing to the 2013 Quebec rail disaster — where the lone engineer on a freight train carrying 2 million gallons of crude oil failed to securely tie down the train leading to a derailment and explosion that killed forty-seven people and destroyed over thirty buildings in the town of Lac-Mégantic. “It’s not what’s gonna happen it’s when it’s gonna happen” he warned. Citing such safety concerns last week the Department of Transportation’s Federal Railroad Administration proposed a new rule requiring minimum two-person crews except in “certain low risk operations.” A public comment period on the proposed rule is open from now until September 26 after which a final decision will be made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFyYmVhY29uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvdGVlbi1oaXQtYW5kLWtpbGxlZC1ieS10cmFpbi1pbi1nZW5ldmEvYXJ0aWNsZV82MGJkNjRjMC0xNTkwLTExZWQtYWFmMi05YmJkYTk1MTljODcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen hit and killed by train in Geneva,"Ashtabula OH (44004)

Tony Finau The Nice Man

“Well-known for his ever-present smile and being generous with his time. Says Finau “If I have a conversation with a person and I leave thinking I’ve brightened their day just a little bit somehow that makes me happy.” Finau joins past winners of the Golf Digest Tour Nice Guys Ranking; Steve Stricker (2013) Jordan Spieth (2017) and Rickie Fowler (2019)” the article reads.

The votes are in. 👀 pic.twitter.com/aZh8SzYYu6 — Golf Digest (@GolfDigest) August 5 2022

Finau was voted as the eighth nicest player in 2019 when Golf Digest last conducted a vote.

Other notable golfers on the list include Jordan Spieth (3) Rory Mcllroy (4) Rickie Fowler (5) Collin Morikawa (8) Viktor Hovland (9) and current world number 1 Scottie Scheffler (21).

Recent PGA Tour Success

Ironically Finau has found great success as of late. The nicest player on tour collected consecutive victories at the 3M Open and the Rocket Mortgage Classic and is now in a prime position to contend for the illustrious Tour Championship which holds a winning check of $20 million.

The back-to-back wins mark the third and fourth wins on the PGA Tour for Finau. He first won in 2016 at the Puerto Rico Open before waiting five years for his second win which came in 2021 at the Northern Trust.

The 2021/22 PGA Tour season was the first year in which Finau has won multiple tournaments in a calendar year.

Finau was recently in Utah on Monday as he held a clinic at Oakridge Country Club prior to the Utah Championship which is taking place now. Finau is not in the field for this week’s Wyndham Championship and will instead further prepare for the start of the FedEx Cup playoffs starting next week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RpY3V0L2VsbGluZ3Rvbi1zb21lcnMvaGlkZGVuLWdlbXMtaGFydGZvcmQtdG9sbGFuZC1jb3VudGllcy040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hidden Gems Of Hartford And Tolland Counties | Ellington CT Patch,"Community Corner Hidden Gems Of Hartford And Tolland Counties The latest Hidden Gem is a delight for hikers and nature lovers.

SOMERS CT — How is it possible that a busy state highway the most-traveled road in Somers can contain a Hidden Gem? In the case of the McCann Family Farm a small sign partially obscured by foliage is the only way one would know about the existence of this scenic land preserve.

McCann's is open to the general public for passive recreation during daylight hours on weekends and holidays. Located on the south side of Route 190 the 84-acre property has a small parking lot on the edge of a hilly hayfield. Two trails are open to the public. Both are maintained well-marked with plastic diamonds and both finish back at the parking lot. The 1.95 mile Shady Brook Trail (blue diamonds) stays in the northern two-thirds of the property while the 3.0 mile Escarpment Trail (yellow diamonds) visits the southern boundary area.

For nature loves more than 300 species of trees flowers ferns and other plants have been identified and more than 120 species of birds have been recorded. Three separate areas all adjacent to the hayfields have been designated as a bird sanctuary. ____

The building is due to be finished in November 2022 and is nearing the final stages of construction.

The terminal building will be home to the Oasis-class Allure of the Seas significantly increasing the capacity from Galveston for Royal Caribbean International. It will be one of the most technologically advanced cruise terminals in the United States.

Royal Caribbean’s Galveston Terminal Nears Completion

Royal Caribbean shared some images today showing the company’s progress on its new cruise terminal in Galveston Texas. The state-of-the-art facility already shows Royal Caribbean’s signature anchor logo on the roof and is about 75% complete.

Contractors completed installing active power and air conditioning with final outfitting including the interior designs furnishings and IT systems.

The opening of the 161300-square-foot building in November 2022 will mark the first time Galveston welcomes the world’s largest cruise ships the cruise line’s signature Oasis Class beginning with Allure of the Seas.

The project is a partnership between Royal Caribbean International Ceres Terminal Holdings LLC and the Galveston Wharves. Construction of the 68-foot tall building front started in the summer of 2021 when contractors broke ground marking the start of construction. Since then the terminal’s structure has risen and will be completed in the fall of this year.

With a total cost of 126 million dollars the cruise terminal will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings for embarking and disembarking cruise ship passengers in the United States. Mobile check-in and facial recognition will enhance boarding and disembarking at the terminal.

Situated at Pier 10 in Galveston Port the building will be used exclusively for Royal Caribbean cruise ships sailing from the port or visiting Galveston.

Allure Adventure & Radiance of the Seas From Galveston

Once completed the new terminal building will be able to handle the mass of people that come to Galveston to sail onboard the Oasis-class Allure of the Seas. Starting November 13 the 5484 passengers and 225282 gross tons cruise ship will be sailing on a series of seven-night western Caribbean cruises.

From Galveston guests can sail to ports such as Isla Roatan Honduras; Costa Maya Mexico; and Cozumel Mexico.

Allure of the Seas will not be the only Royal Caribbean International cruise ship to call Galveston home. She will be joined by Adventure of the Seas from the end of November 2022.

Adventure of the Seas will also be sailing to the Western Caribean operating four and five-night cruises to Cozumel and Costa Maya.

Radiance of the Seas is the third Royal Caribbean cruise ship that will operate from Galveston sailing on nine and ten-night voyages to the Western Caribbean starting in January 2023. Port calls include visits to Progreso Mexico; Cartagena Colombia; Colon Panama; and Cozumel Mexico.

The new Royal Caribbean 161300-square-foot cruise terminal will significantly boost Galveston’s cruise-related income. It has already created 400 construction jobs and will employ 400 people with permanent positions once it opens this fall.

The GeForce GTX 1650 Super and Radeon RX 6500 XT we're looking at today basically weren't available in 2021 despite the former having launched in late 2019 — it was selling for as much as $350 according to our historical GPU pricing data.



2022 has thankfully brought an end to the GPU drought and AMD's Navi 24 cards are selling for less than their official MSRPs. The RX 6500 XT can be had for as little as $180  and the GTX 1650 Super is back in stock as well at least in some places — the EVGA 1650 Super SC goes for around $200 now at Amazon and Newegg as well. Which means we can put these two sub-$200 graphics cards up against each other to see which cheap GPU is the better choice.

We'll look at performance price features and tech drivers and software and power and efficiency in order to determine a winner. Those categories are listed in order of decreasing importance in our view at least so we'll start with the critical aspects and move on down the list from there.

Gaming Performance: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

Gaming remains the main draw for graphics cards though they can also help with video encoding and other tasks — or at least some of them can. Budget GPUs aren't intended for high-resolution gaming instead delivering performance similar to previous-generation midrange and high-end GPUs at substantially lower prices. We put the GTX 1650 Super and RX 6500 XT to the test with our updated 8-game test suite looking at three different settings and resolution combinations.

Swipe to scroll horizontally GeForce GTX 1650 Super vs. Radeon RX 6500 XT Average FPS Game Setting GTX 1650 Super RX 6500 XT % Difference 8 Game Average 1080p Medium 73.7 71.2 3.50% 1080p Ultra 37.1 34.3 8.20% 1440p Ultra 27.3 20.1 35.60% Borderlands 3 1080p Medium 77 81.0 -4.90% 1080p Ultra 38.6 37.1 3.90% 1440p Ultra 26.3 24.2 9.00% Far Cry 6 1080p Medium 80.4 83.1 -3.30% 1080p Ultra 51.7 43.7 18.10% 1440p Ultra 38.9 25.6 51.80% Flight Simulator 1080p Medium 65.1 59.7 9.20% 1080p Ultra 37.4 35.4 5.60% 1440p Ultra 24.9 23.7 5.30% Forza Horizon 5 1080p Medium 82.9 80.2 3.40% 1080p Ultra 30.8 28 10.00% 1440p Ultra 26.4 11.8 123.90% Horizon Zero Dawn 1080p Medium 79.2 71.4 10.80% 1080p Ultra 54.6 56.2 -2.80% 1440p Ultra 42.3 21.9 92.90% Red Dead Redemption 2 1080p Medium 82.4 86.5 -4.70% 1080p Ultra 38.3 30.2 27.00% 1440p Ultra 29.7 24.9 18.90% Total War Warhammer 3 1080p Medium 44.1 33.7 30.90% 1080p Ultra 24.0 17.7 35.80% 1440p Ultra 14.7 10.4 40.30% Watch Dogs Legion 1080p Medium 78.8 74.3 6.10% 1080p Ultra 21.5 26.1 -17.60% 1440p Ultra 14.9 18.3 -18.30%

1080p gaming is the real target for these cards though some lighter games might manage 1440p at lower quality settings. 1440p ultra obviously pushes things too far with sub-30 fps performance in most of the games we tested. So let's just ignore the 1440p ultra numbers and focus on 1080p performance.



It's a bit of a mixed bag with wild swings in relative performance depending on the game. Overall performance at 1080p medium basically ended up a tie with the GTX 1650 Super holding a negligible 2% lead. In the individual games the 1650 Super was anywhere from 4% slower (Borderlands 3) to a whopping 31% faster (Total War: Warhammer 3). But for the most part the two provided a comparable experience.



Bumping the quality settings from medium to ultra creates problems in several of the games which start to use more than the 4GB of VRAM that's available on these GPUs. Forza Horizon 5 Red Dead Redemption 2 Total War: Warhammer 3 and Watch Dogs Legion all see performance basically cut in half sometimes more. Most of the games remained playable meaning 30 fps or more but TWW3 and WDL both dropped below that mark.

Technically AMD's RX 6500 XT has the advantage of also supporting DXR (DirectX Raytracing) which the GTX 1650 Super fails to run (you need a 6GB GTX 10- or 16-series GPU for limited DXR support). However performance in DXR games on the 6500 XT even at 1080p medium is typically so slow as to be meaningless. In our 6-game DXR test suite the RX 6500 XT averaged 13.5 fps and failed to run Control (which requires 6GB or more to enable DXR). Fortnite was the best result at 20 fps while a couple of the games didn't even break 10 fps. Don't bother in other words.



It's interesting what AMD is able to do with significantly less memory bandwidth even with a relatively small 16MB Infinity Cache. The RX 6500 XT has just 144 GB/s of bandwidth compared to 192 GB/s for the GTX 1650 Super due to the 64-bit memory bus on Navi 24. However the 232 GB/s of Infinity Cache bandwidth basically makes up the difference most of the time. It starts to fall short at ultra settings but those mostly aren't playable anyway.



Incidentally while we're only showing average fps the 99th percentile lows are mostly the same story except Nvidia's lead is slightly larger. Overall the GTX 1650 Super was 4.9% faster on minimum fps at 1080p medium 10.0% faster at 1080p ultra and 43.7% faster at 1440p ultra. In other words the framerate consistency was slightly worse on the RX 6500 XT.



While the performance might look like a tie that's using a modern test system that supports the PCIe 4.0 interface. We also tested RX 6500 XT with PCIe 3.0 speeds  and performance dropped by 9% overall but there were instances where it was up to 40% slower. Testing the GTX 1650 Super on the same two PCs showed a 2% improvement in performance on the older Core i9-9900K system so the drop in AMD performance can safely be attributed to the PCIe interface and platform. That gives Nvidia the overall lead for this category.



Winner: Nvidia GTX 1650 Super

Nvidia came out ahead at all three tested settings and resolutions using a modern test PC. 1080p medium performance was pretty much tied and we could throw AMD a bone for its ray tracing hardware. However for budget hardware we feel there's a far greater chance these cards will end up in a PC that doesn't support PCIe 4.0 which means Nvidia gets the lead. Neither one of these GPUs are particularly potent of course. You're getting the equivalent of an RX 580 8GB (but with less VRAM) or a bit faster than a GTX 980 half a decade after those GPUs were in their prime.

Price: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

Prices have been all over the place for most of the past two years though the RX 6500 XT only launched back in January 2022. The GTX 1650 Super originally debuted with a price of just $159 in 2019 and it was an excellent value at the time. Prices trended upward in 2020 and then spiked horrifically in 2021 when the GPU shortages and pandemic-influenced supply chain issues were at their worst. Even now nearly three years after its launch the lowest prices on the GTX 1650 Super are still $200.



Unless you're willing to take a chance with a used card which changes things up slightly. The GTX 1650 Super can be had for around $130 on eBay  while the RX 6500 XT starts at around $150 . Both of those prices are very much estimates as eBay shows far more fluctuations than retail stores. Plus buying a used graphics card represents a risk. The good news is that neither of these GPUs would have been a great option for mining purposes due to having only 4GB of memory so they probably weren’t run into the ground by their former owners.



What's not clear is whether Nvidia is still actively producing the TU116 chips that sit at the heart of the GTX 1650 Super. It hasn't officially discontinued production as far as we're aware but the supply of budget-friendly GTX 16-series cards hasn't been all that great for a while now. The RTX 3050 meanwhile represents a large step up in price performance and features so Nvidia doesn't have a direct replacement for the GTX 1650 Super. And no the GTX 1630 is not the GPU you're looking for [waves hand].

Winner: AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT

Retail pricing trumps eBay pricing and right now you save $20 by going with the AMD RX 6500 XT. Unless Nvidia starts providing a steady supply of TU116 chips — for the GTX 1650 Super as well as the GTX 1660 and GTX 1660 Super — AMD will likely maintain its modest pricing advantage.

Normally newer GPU architectures come with additional features. AMD's Navi 24 and Nvidia's GTX 16-series represent an exception to that rule in different ways.



Despite using the Turing architecture  the GTX 1650 Super doesn't support ray tracing or DLSS — two of the biggest additions to Turing. It does support the improved Turing NVENC hardware which promises higher quality streaming encodes with less of a hit on gaming performance however which does beat Navi 24.



AMD's Navi 24 GPU meanwhile represents some serious cuts to the basic RDNA 2 architecture feature set. There's no video encoding hardware only video decoding hardware. The PCIe interface also gets trimmed to just an x4 link which despite being PCIe 4.0 capable still has half the potential throughput as the GTX 1650 Super's PCIe 3.0 x16 interface. It's also limited to two display outputs typically one HDMI 2.1 and one DisplayPort 1.4.



The one major feature AMD supports with RX 6500 XT that Nvidia does not is ray tracing but as noted earlier it's much more of a checkbox feature than something most people would consider using. Other competing features are mostly comparable like G-Sync vs FreeSync  Reflex vs Anti-Lag etc. You get the same amount of memory (4GB) and both GPUs require a 6-pin (or sometimes 8-pin) power connection.



Winner: Nvidia GTX 1650 Super

We said in our initial review that Navi 24 represented too many cuts to the basic feature set. A 64-bit memory interface x4 PCIe interface and no encoding hardware make this a GPU that feels more like something from five years ago. Sure there's RT hardware but it's only a token effort and is largely useless with only 4GB of memory. This is a close call but ultimately we give Nvidia a slight edge.

Drivers and Software: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

AMD and Nvidia release regular driver updates for their GPUs. In AMD's case the company typically drops larger annual overhauls of its Radeon drivers but the biggest changes in the past couple of years have focused on improving DirectX 11 performance in a few cases and cleaning up bugs. Most major game launches tend to see AMD Game Ready drivers though not necessarily WHQL certified drivers.

Nvidia maintains a similar release schedule for its GeForce drivers. It doesn't always have a monthly driver update but you can count on having Game Ready Drivers on launch day for most major game releases. Nearly every Nvidia driver (outside the occasional hotfix) is WHQL certified. It's an extra step though in practice we're not sure how much it really matters — we've seen UI bugs and other issues still slip through the WHQL process.



AMD and Nvidia have different approaches to their driver user interfaces. Nvidia splits its GeForce driver options into two applications. Nvidia Control Panel handles the GPU settings such as resolution texture filtering vertical sync low latency mode power management and more. The control panel also handles display configuration settings such as color rotation and multi-display setups. Nvidia GeForce Experience handles game settings driver updates and includes game streaming and recording features as well as performance tuning options. To access the GeForce Experience features you must log in with an Nvidia user account.



AMD takes a somewhat more streamlined approach in that the Radeon driver software is a one-stop-shop for all your Radeon GPU settings and features. The Radeon Adrenaline 2022 software suite includes automatic driver updates game performance profiles built-in broadcasting software to stream and record your gameplay and performance metrics and overclocking options.



Winner: Tie



Both Nvidia and AMD have different advantages with their drivers and accompanying software but they offer generally equivalent experiences. Driver updates come on a regular basis and both companies are well versed in testing and tuning their drivers to extract good gaming performance. Nvidia might do a bit better on a selection of less popular games but we already gave it the performance category so we're calling this a tie.

Power Consumption / Efficiency: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

The GTX 1650 Super and RX 6500 XT aren't particularly demanding cards with official TBP (typical board power) ratings of 100W and 107W respectively. As you can guess real-world testing might show some minor differences but any decent power supply should prove sufficient for these GPUs.



Some models might have a larger factory overclock and require an 8-pin connector and all cards will need at least a 6-pin connector. That's enough for the card to use up to 150W (75W from the 6-pin and 75W from the PCIe slot) and even the largest factory overclocks are unlikely to push things that far.



AMD's previous generation GPUs often used far more power than their Nvidia counterparts but that's not the case with the current lineup. In our testingthe RX 6500 XT used 90W of power in our Metro Exodus test and 113W in FurMark while the GTX 1650 Super used 101W in Metro and 102W in FurMark. There's a good chance other games would have the RX 6500 XT using more power which means overall it's a tie.



That's certainly an interesting outcome considering Nvidia's GTX 1650 Super uses TSMC's older 12nm FFN node while the AMD RX 6500 XT uses the newer 7nm node. AMD's Navi 24 also has a 107mm^2 die size compared to Nvidia's TU116 with a 284mm^2 chip size (though a decent chunk of the TU116 chip is disabled on this card). But lower clock speeds and other architectural differences come into play and ultimately power draw ends up being very similar.



Winner: Tie



A difference of 5–10W in real-world use cases basically doesn't matter when both cards have the same PSU connectivity requirements. 100W of power give or take means your graphics card shouldn't need a massive cooler with lots of fans and the fans should spin at relatively low speeds leading to a quiet PC overall.

""The car was lights out"" Gillmore said noting that he was unsure how it would take to a track reworked during intermission. ""The car was perfect. I about messed it up on my own that first lap but got my compsoure together and made it work.""

Gillmore started outside of Jackson on the front row and won the race for the lead as the green flag flew. He built a 2.1-second led by lap eight when a caution slowed the action and erased Gillmore’s comfortable margin.

""I was expecting at any moment for Chris to find something on the bottom"" Gillmore said. ""I moved to the top on the restart and kept my eyes peeled to know if I had to play defensive or not. I was watching the board and and I knew when (the camera operator) wasn't looking at just me that was a good thing.""

Slader drove around Jackson two laps after the restart but could not keep up with the leader. Gillmore’s lead was back to 1.3 seconds through lap 15 and he went out to drive away to finish 1.9 seconds clear of Slader.

Jackson the season points leader with Gillmore not far behind finished third with Brian Bolin fourth and Jon Sheets came home in fifth.

Beck leads all the way for USRA Stock Car win: Mason Beck never looked back leading all the way to capture the O'Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars feature.

It was Beck's first official victory of the season after his apparent recent win was wiped out after a disqualification in post-race tech.

""I was dang sure gonna win it tonight"" Beck said in victory lane.

Beck led from the start and was 0.711 second in front of Jaylen Wettengel when the first caution flew on lap eight. Dean Wille moved around Wettengel and into second on the restart as Beck continued to lead.

Hendrix joined the top three by lap 15 but no one was a match for Beck as the Urbana driver pulled away over the final laps to win by two seconds over Robert White who beat Wille by a couple of free for the runner-up spot.

""I knew I had some heavy hitters behind me"" Beck said. ""I saw Dean Wille and knew he was starting behind me. I was watching for David Hendrix to show his nose on the top but I guess he never got to it.""

Hendrix wound up fourth and Wettengel finished fifth.

No racing next week: Lucas Oil Speedway takes next week off with the next action coming up Aug. 20 with UTV short-course action on the off road track during the day. The Big Adventure Weekly Racing Series on the dirt track is set for the evening in the next-to-last weekly program of the regular season.

OMAHA Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett’s company reported a $43.76 billion loss in the second quarter as the paper value of its investments plummeted but Berkshire Hathaway’s many operating companies generally performed well suggesting the overall economy is weathering the pressure from inflation and rising interest rates.

Berkshire said Saturday that a largely unrealized $53 billion decline in the value of its investments forced it to report a loss of nearly $44 billion or $29754 per Class A share. That is down from $28.1 billion or $18488 per Class A share a year ago.

The stock prices of three of Berkshire's biggest investments — Apple American Express and Bank of America — all fell significantly during the second quarter. But those stocks have all rebounded during the third quarter meaning Berkshire’s portfolio is already worth more than it was at the end of the quarter.

Buffett has long said he believes Berkshire’s operating earnings are a better measure of the company’s performance because they exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely quarter to quarter. By that measure Berkshire’s earnings were up significantly to $9.28 billion or $6312.49 per Class A share from last year’s $6.69 billion or $4399.92 per Class A share.

The four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings per Class A share of $4741.64.

Besides investments Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright. Berkshire said operating profits were up at all of its major units including its insurance companies major utilities and BNSF railroad. The strong results at most of its companies offset a $487 million pretax underwriting loss at Geico which reported bigger auto claims losses because of the soaring value of vehicles and ongoing shortages of car parts.

CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said Geico’s results suggest the auto insurer is having more trouble raising rates to offset those higher costs than its peers at Progressive and Allstate so “I definitely think that merits watching.”

Berkshire is often seen as a microcosm of the broader economy because its eclectic collection of manufacturing retail insurance utility and service businesses touches so many different industries and Berkshire’s profits tend to follow whatever the economy is doing. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Berkshire’s strong operating results suggest that many businesses have been able to raise prices enough to offset surging inflation and even though higher interest rates are hurting Berkshire’s network of car dealers and its manufactured home division other parts of the company are benefitting from higher rates on investments.

“This is a business that has its tentacles in all different parts of the economy. To show such broad revenue and earnings strength throughout the franchise it gives me a lot of confidence that the broader economy is performing pretty well” Shanahan said.

Berkshire said its revenue grew more than 10% to $76.2 billion in the quarter as many of its businesses increased prices.

Berkshire said it was sitting on $105.4 billion cash at the end of the quarter which was little changed from the $106 billion it reported at the end of the first quarter. That signaled Buffett wasn't buying nearly as many stocks during the second quarter although it has reported investing several billion in Occidental Petroleum. In the first three months of the year Berkshire spent more than $51 billion on stocks.

Berkshire did spend $1 billion buying back its own shares in the quarter but the pace of those buybacks has slowed significantly. Berkshire repurchased $3.2 billion of its shares in the first quarter and $27 billion last year. Before this year's buying spree of stocks such as oil producers Occidental and Chevron and printer maker HP Inc. repurchases had been Buffett's biggest investment in recent years as he struggled to find major acquisitions.

Berkshire's acquisition drought ended this year when he signed a $11.6 billion deal to acquire the insurance conglomerate Alleghany.

One interesting tidbit disclosed deep in Berkshire's Securities and Exchange Commission filing is that the company bought Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel's stake in Berkshire's utility unit for $870 million in June. Abel is set to take over as Berkshire CEO once Buffett is unavailable although the legendary 91-year-old investor has no plans to retire. The filing offered no indication of what Abel would do with the money including whether he would reinvest it in Berkshire shares.

Some investors have called for Abel to increase his Berkshire investment before he takes over as CEO so he would have a bigger stake in the company's future. At last report Abel held five Class A shares and nearly 2400 Class B shares.
